29 September 2008,"Just As Intriguing The Second Time, Too!","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

30 May 2018,Fantastic.,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+"".",10

20 October 2006,A Nutshell Review: The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist. The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit. What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets. And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas. The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist! I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all. At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other. P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's movies?",10
28 October 2006,Give This Film Time to Sink In...,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.

The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".

I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.

Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.

Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.

The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.

If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list.",10
16 October 2006,Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.

27 December 2006,Webby meshwork of magic and mystery,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.

The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.

The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.

Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.

To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.

With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.

'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).

21 October 2006,Storytelling at its best!,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.

Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.

With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.

The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.

The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.

In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",8
17 February 2021,The Prestige,"Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film.

19 October 2006,One of the best movies EVER,"What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie.

This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.

9 December 2008,Imaginative and intriguing crash of wits between two famous magicians,"This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among magicians is set in turn-of-the last century, London.Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) his wife Julie McCullough(Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden(admirable Christian Bale) are friends and magician's assistants. Then Julie accidentally deceases during a sideshow , Robert accuses Alfred for her killing . A new assistant named Olivia(Scarlett Johansson) helps Robert and he falls in love with her, though later she fell in love with another man. The magicians use their powers to combat among them. Both become prestigious magicians and get mutual envy. Magician Robert sees the Borden's transportation show and he becomes obsessed with his magic trick. They battle each other for their magic tricks and Robert attempts disclose the secret about disappearance from his contender with fateful results.

This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres: the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era, mystery thriller and fantasy.The picture gets it all : suspense, mystery drama, star crossed lovers,plot twists, murders,tragedy and supernatural illusions . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Jackman, Bale, Johansson as eclectic secondaries, Caine,David Bowie,Andie Serkis and Rebecca Hall.Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Wally Pfister. Intriguing and evocative musical score by David Julyan. The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night¨. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think. The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final.",8
29 December 2008,Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.

I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.

All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).

PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).",8

26 January 2016,fascinating,"a film about magic at different levels. the magic as art. the magic as axis of life. art as only way to survive. beautiful, mysterious, ambiguous and almost impeccable. in fact, brilliant job. and this status is result of delicate-precise mixture of acting, impeccable story, splendid atmosphere and the feeling than competition escapes from the screen. a seductive detail - David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a role who gives to film a special flavor. at first sigh, story of a cruel fight for success. or a portrait of manipulation art. in fact, fresco of a time. and one of admirable roles for Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.

28 April 2007,"A Great Tale of Rivalry, Obsession, Revenge and Sacrifice","In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.

""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")",9
25 May 2018,"""The Prestige"" starts well but cheats with its own premise...","There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc.

Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.

Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.

French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film.

So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?

The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.

At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.

Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie).

The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate.",7
9 May 2021,"Magic in parts, meh in others","The first time I watched ""The Prestige"", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.

This movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.

Nolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.

What lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.

The music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.

Mercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.

""The Prestige"" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.

Invulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with ""Tenet"" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch.",7
10 February 2019,Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.

Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.

These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.

This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".

Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?

I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.",10
27 November 2011,"""It is very rare to see... real magic.""","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

13 February 2018,"Great entertainment, though it pigeonholes itself there","This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.

My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.

Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief.",7
13 August 2023,An outstanding movie.,"Magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier were once friends, but following an accidental death, the pair are determined to outshine, when ultimately destroy one another.

It's a dizzying, dazzling, complex mystery, it may need a rewatch, as there's so much happening, it may be a little hard to keep up with all that's happening in front of you, but there's no denying, this is a captivating film.

One of the best lineups imaginable, headliners Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both tremendous, two genuine legends, both at the top of their game. The supporting cast of Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie are all spot on.

So many great and memorable moments, I think the scenes of Alfred and Robert upstaging one another were possibly the best bits of the film.

The special effects are quite something, I'm watching this seventeen years in, and it still looks amazing. The make up department did a tremendous job here.

Terrific visuals in general, great costumes and sets compliment the amazing location work.

It remains a terrific movie.

19 October 2010,(Magic) Layers,"I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".

But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.

Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!",10

23 February 2012,Masterfully Handled!!!,"I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.

I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.

Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.

If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did.

29 February 2012,Remarkable. Nolan's best,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times.

18 July 2007,I'm addicted to it,"Every so often I see a film that I get addicted to. As soon as I watch it in the cinema I know I'm going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.

Well The Prestige is the latest of these. This film gets better and better with each viewing. Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.

People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.

Christopher Nolan is a master. Even though he seems quite humourless in his DVD extra interviews. He makes extremely entertaining films that are well cast and superbly executed, just as the Prestige is.

All those who never liked the film should be rounded up in a field and used for crazed scientific experiments, we could use Tesla!",10
18 March 2007,Top Notch cast and many plot twists will make this film a must see,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige.""

""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.

First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.

Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.

Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!",10

There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.

New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!

i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!

I hope you enjoy it as much as i did.

6 November 2006,One of the most engaging and impressive character pieces I've seen all year,"""The Prestige"" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan.""

As for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in ""The Machinist"" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...)

The film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.

What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.

Chilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet.",10
20 October 2006,This was an amazing movie!,"This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.

23 June 2009,It Had Its Moments,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",5

14 March 2010,Obsession is a young man's game,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in ""The Prestige"" a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.

Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.

This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.

""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla. Jackman and Bale are well-matched as adversaries - both volatile and ambitious, driven men.

Like a magician, Nolan distracts the viewer with one thing and then pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Sheer brilliance.

You'll want to see this movie again. Highly recommended.",9
18 May 2016,Over-complicated mess of a Nolan,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't.

22 January 2013,Nolan's best? I think so.,"One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.

There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.

This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!

The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.

In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.

Watch it; it is truly magical.",9
6 January 2008,The magic isn't there...,"I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: ""The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary"". And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.

Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes...",3
7 January 2021,The Prestige - It's An Illusion With Little Real Class To Be Found Under The Surface,"Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!

If it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing. Characters are bleak and over-the-top nasty, not leaving much (if anything) to admire.",3

15 April 2008,Intelligent and incredibly suspenseful,"Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.

This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.

Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006. A definite must-see!",10
3 November 2006,Wonderful story of magical rivalry is best seen knowing as little as possible,"The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.

Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.

Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.

You have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.

For me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the ""sparklies"" of the box.

Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them.",9
16 May 2009,The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch.",9
20 November 2006,"I love long, dark, well-acted and intelligent films but not this one","I love a film that doesn't spoonfeed the plot and the story and the interest in it to the audience. This one takes you along if you are smart enough to go and if you are not so dumbed down by most entertainment that you can stay steadily involved.

I wanted to love it to death...it has everything I think a film should have, including a wonderfully rich atmosphere, a great cast and excellent direction. Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.

It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.

I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.

It was a very good film in a detached sort of ""viewing art"" way but as far as feeling ""wow""'d by the end, not so much.",4

30 October 2006,The best movie of the year! (minor spoilers),"The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is!

Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.

Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE!

Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, ""BOOM"" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.

Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments. I would greatly appreciate it.

15 November 2006,Outstandingly good film,"This film is about the unscrupulous rivalry between two magicians, who tried to do everything to be better than the other.

I have already heard that it is a very good film before I saw the film. Indeed, the film has not disappointed me. This is the best film I have seen in a long time! First of all, the plot is excellent. A story about magic is in itself intriguing. Coupled with a lot of very unexpected and unimaginable and yet realistic twists, this film leaves you surprised until the very end. There are many chilling moments, and many moments where the viewers are made to fidget in their seat because of immense suspense. When everything was unveiled and demystified in the end, I was in astonishment of the outstanding quality of the film.

The character development is excellent. The viewers can all understand the cause of the rivalry, and we can all relate and sympathise with he characters.

Acting is great. The set designs are visually attractive and nostalgic, and it can easily be seen that a lot of effort has been put into this.",
7 August 2021,Absolutely Terrific,"It doesn't rely on special effects at all so it does not age in the slightest. Just a unique story with excellent writing, professional directing, and wonderful acting from an all-star cast, which never gets old. This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional ""suspension of disbelief"" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with ""The Sixth Sense"" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is.

21 June 2007,Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!,"The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...

The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years.",8
17 July 2023,"""Are you watching closely?""","FILM: 9/10.

Christopher Nolan's 2006 film, The Prestige, is just as mind-bending and captivating as I remember it. From the very first scene, I found myself completely drawn into the intricate battle of wits between Christian Bale's Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier. The film's narrative structure, with its Nolan-trademarked non-linear storytelling, adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps you guessing until the very end.

One of the highlights of this rewatch was David Bowie's portrayal of Nikola Tesla. Bowie's performance is nothing short of excellent, capturing the enigmatic nature of the legendary inventor. His presence on screen is magnetic, and every scene he's in becomes instantly more intriguing. It's a testament to Bowie's talent as an actor that he seamlessly fits into the already stellar cast.

Another standout aspect of The Prestige is David Julyan's score. It's sparse, yet incredibly effective in building tension and enhancing the film's mysterious atmosphere. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the story, and the score's minimalistic approach allows the performances and plot to take center stage. It's a masterful work that lingers in your mind even after the credits roll.

As I followed Borden and Angier's rivalry, I became engrossed in their obsession with magic and the lengths they are willing to go to outdo each other. The film delves deep into themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions. Each twist and turn in the plot challenges you, and the final revelation still leaves me in awe. The Prestige is a testament to Christopher Nolan's storytelling prowess. His direction is flawless, and he effortlessly weaves together themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the nature of illusion.

The Prestige is a cinematic gem that combines a compelling story, brilliant performances, and a touch of magic. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and thematically rich experience. This rewatch reminded me of why I fell in love with this film in the first place, and it has only deepened my appreciation for its intricacies. If you're a fan of mystery, suspense, and thought-provoking narratives, The Prestige is an absolute must-watch.

18 March 2007,Brilliant!,"When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.

The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...

From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.

Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.

Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now.",9
2 June 2011,The Prestige (2006) - Are You Watching Closely?,"Christopher Nolan, the master of tricking the mind, comes back with his biggest hit since ""Memento"". ""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints! ""The Prestige"", in my review, ""A mind-bending puzzle that's fun to watch again and again"".",10
26 October 2006,Is Hollywood actually getting something right this year?,"It just seems like I'm seeing a bunch of good movies that have been released in 2006: The Departed, The Illusionist, United 93, and now The Prestige, an exciting magic drama with exciting stars: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The Prestige is a well thought out story that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, has great acting, fun magic, and a fantastic look and feel. My friend thought the film was too long, but I thought it was extremely well paced. Believe me, this is a film not to be missed.

The Prestige is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Rupert has showman appeal that gets the audience excited and Alfred has the gift of how to perform magic very well. They go back and forth pulling horrible tricks on each other that not only causes hurt feelings, pain, and death. They also are playing with their lovely assistant's, Olivia, heart. How far will they go just to see who can out magic who?

I absolutely loved how much Rupert and Alfred played off each other, you couldn't even choose a side because both of them were complete jerks, if that's even a strong enough word for it, but they did it so well. I loved how they kept trying to figure out each other's secrets and outwit each other in every one of their shows. I have got to tell you that Rupert's shows are so much fun to watch on the screen! There are some good laughs and cries throughout the film and I am not going to be surprised at all if this film is nominated during Oscar time. I would highly recommend The Prestige, one of the best films of 2006!

20 October 2006,"A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film","I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.

It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).

The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.

Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.

Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.

Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.

Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.

Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.

5 August 2012,Mr. Christopher Nolan: A Genius,"After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.

Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.

It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility.

Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain.

No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie. Please, enjoy it and know that you won't be disappointed.

In fact, you will remember the Prestige for quite a while.",9
18 February 2007,"Uncompelling, so-so script, poor plot.","Like memento, here we have a relative simple story which by telling it either backward or through bits and pieces is supposed to become interesting. On the whole of course that never works for those with an imagination larger than that of an amoeba or for those that have seen the formulaic twist in already way too many predecessors.

In the case of Prestige, to my surprise, there wasn't even a twist to speak of which really didn't matter much because the movie became drying paint already so much earlier, albeit in a nice shade of the colour blue.

The story of Prestige is practically non-existent. But by telling it by means of flashbacks, tiresomely revealing spoon-fed bits of it, the plot and intrigue unfolds. Fast paced editing to throw in some confusion for good measure and some fake beards and fancy dress-up to, i guess, try to confuse the viewer on who was who and more importantly; when. Yet, as more and more of the story unravels, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a story but more a collection of dreary facts.

In the ""Usual Suspects"" for example, there was actually a compelling story unraveling while the writers worked their way towards the twist. Prestige only had some repetitive drama and therefore relied soly on the twist itself. Alas, many spotted the twist some 10 minutes into the film and it was hardly an earth-shattering twist anyway. I found no chemistry between the key-players and Bale and Jackman just lack any charisma whatsoever in their role (the keyword is magical showmenship, something they both lacked) and are therefore miscasted. Think i'm being harsh? Imagine either one of them playing the role of Eisenheim or Leopold, both charismatic characters/actors in The Illusionist.. I rest my case...

The performances in Prestige were on par but the script was just too monotonous on too many occasions. On an even more annoyed note: Bowie was unrecognizable, Johanssen reduced to the human equivalent of a tittybar and Sir Cain to be honest, failed to impress but may have done this on purpose as a lesson learned from his literally outstanding performance in Children of Men. Another highly overrated film from 2006 in which his performance painfully made the acting of practically anyone else a complete joke.

The cinematography in Prestige, though suiting the story and time in which it was set, was relentlessly dark which really was eye-candy but on the other hand didn't help the many plodding and derivative scenes.

The only thing that made the movie endurable was the fine female company I was with, which provided the necessary distraction which made me miss some key-scenes which offered a bit of challenge to work it all out.

I guess Nolan just isn't my kind of storyteller and his rather one-tracked stories not my cup of tea.

8 April 2007,"No magic, just cheating","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way.

8 March 2021,Magic,"I've found this to be one of Nolans most entertaining and rewatchable movies. Two magicians start out as friends but develop a dangerous rivalry. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography. This shows the brilliant storytelling, which Nolan has mastered.

21 October 2006,Are you watching closely?,"2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes.

Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film.

It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.

Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant.

All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history.

29 October 2006,"a basic tale of one-up-manship, but done in a great fashion of professional storytelling and acting","The Prestige is like a machine of tricks and wonders, and it ends up pulling off a lot more than it might have not been able to chew. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.

Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians, who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter, who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic', which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo), the rivalry and, more crucially, the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden, who is, according to Jackman's Angier, living his entire life as a trick, which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier, who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film), who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye, with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen, in a spiffy English accent that works), on the sidelines.

What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters, who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician, while the other is a better showman, and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film, and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall, one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality, and how one can cheat death or not, or again, and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed, or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.

But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling, with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us, and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain, or rather, a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen, yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary, and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises. It's one of the best productions to come out this season.",8
22 October 2006,The game for the young,"Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, ""Obsession is the game of young men"" In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. ""The Prestige"" starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.

I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, ""Watch closely"" In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. ""The Prestige"" perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies; Bale as Batman in ""Batman Begins"". However, there are no heroes in ""The Prestige"". Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his ""Transported Man"" trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.

Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"") infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his ""The Prestige"" is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.

Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. ""The Prestige"" is one of the year's best movies.",10

28 October 2006,a gorgeous film,"What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.

This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.

However, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?",9

3 December 2006,a strong piece of cinematic legerdemain,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation - a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.

Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are the two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage. Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.

With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel. The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core. More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making. The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.

The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.

On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along. Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.",8

14 August 2007,"Fascinating film with plenty of suspense, humour, mystery and a little of science fiction throw in this intriguing story.","Near the end of the 19th century in London. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson), his wife Julia (Piper Perabo) and their friend Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to a magician (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Caine). When Julia accidentally dies during an performance. Robert blames on his friend Alfred and they become enemies. Both of them have become famous for different reasons and they are always trying to out smart each other on their new tricks. Alfred becomes much more successful with his tricks and always doing much better than Robert. Robert becomes obsessed on trying to find out how Alfred's secret tricks. Both risk everything to be the greatest magician, while there's full of lies and sabotage between the two. But nothing what it seems between these new magicians, while one of them might have to face tragic consequences.

Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Insomnia ""2002"", Memento) made an entertaining, suspenseful, mystery film with plenty of humour with unsuspecting plot twists. Nolan brings many intriguing visual style with drama as well. Jackman, Bale and Caine are excellent in this picture. Which it is somewhat underrated, when it was released last year in theaters. This movie has an fine supporting cast like Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and Roger Rees.

DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an featurette and an photo gallery. This DVD could have used more features like an audio commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted scenes, outtakes and an full length documentary. But it will be probably for an future DVD release. This film received two Oscar nominations like Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. This ingenious picture will play well on DVD and this have an major cult following as well. Nolan is certainly one of the most gifted filmmakers of the 21th century and plenty of good films from his to come in the near future. Don't miss it. Screenplay by the director and his brother Jonathan Nolan (The Dark Knight, Interstellar). Based on a novel by Christopher Priest. Panavision. (****/*****).",8
18 July 2007,"""It is inhuman to be so cold""...","""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.

13 December 2021,UK ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"The Prestige is my most favorite movie of Nolan. This movie is magic in itself. It has broken timelines which enhance the storytelling and it is done artistically. It was feeling like an ordinary movie until the major twist reveals. It's a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performance. The character development was brilliant.

24 October 2006,"For the look on their faces...to make them Wonder, just for even a moment...","Brilliantly using the role of a magician as an allegory for not just the ""magic"" of film-making, but for the dark, psychologically complex motives of the auteur filmmaker, director Christopher Nolan has dispelled his critics who claim he's just another hack and treated his fans to a twisty delight with ""The Prestige."" This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic ""Memento,"" the haunting ""Insomnia,"" and the refreshingly dark ""Batman Begins""), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.

""The Prestige"" is almost impossible to critique without giving away a major plot twist, as the actual twists make the film so fascinatingly rich in that deep down spooky kind of way. The story of dueling magicians (a fairly good Hugh Jackman and a typically brilliant Christian Bale) gets off to a prodding start after we're told from the opening shot by Bale's eerie voice-over narration to ""watch closely."" Slowly, and inevitably, the tale of one-upmanship and revenge gets under your skin as you try to figure out what the biggest trick is going to be.

Where this year's similarly themed ""Illusionist"" was lush and romantic, ""The Prestige"" is brooding and riddled with psychosis. Focusing on one trick and fueled by love, ""The Illusionist"" sucked in viewers. Focusing on the twisting of time and narration and multiple tricks fueled by competition and hatred, ""The Prestige"" transfixes viewers into a slow-burning flicker of mesmerized menace. Like Nolan's other films, the blood really starts to pump in the second half as the actors are allowed to truly emote and chew the scenery (think of Carrie-Ann Moss's turn of character in the later part of ""Memento"" and you'll get an idea of the level Jackman and a superb Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife reach when performing ""the turns""), while the plot mechanizations begin to carefully fall into place and their character arcs intertwine in fantastically tragic ways.

Michael Caine (always reliable in these type of mentor roles), Scarlett Johansson (a bit over-exposed this year through no fault of her own by multiple releases but doing a decent British accent here and looking smashing as always), Andy Serkis (a crafty trickster of an actor), and David Bowie (as Tesla) provide fine acting support. Meanwhile, Nolan turns the screws of his mind games tighter than any other bankable director working today and painted a look on my face...that for more than a fleeting moment, but for the entire two-hour runtime and many hours more after, made me Wonder. ""The Prestige"" is pure movie magic.",9

7 June 2015,Magical!!!,"Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.

Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.

Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.

Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.

These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist.",9

4 January 2022,Brilliant story.,"What a story. An engaging and developed timeline of conflict and drama and event. A brilliant film overall. The direction, the execution- simply a masterpiece of layered emotion.

One of my favorite films for many years and only on this viewing have I recognized it's special place as a 10/10 for me. From nine to ten since my first viewing in 2013 and many subsequent viewings to today. Nolan's masterpiece.

27 January 2007,Great film,"I've been a fan of Nolan for a long time, ever since Memento. He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays ""franchise"" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians? The man is a master, only a notch below Hitchcock himself, and this film is his masterwork, so far.",10

7 May 2007,Show stolen by David Bowie...,"Christopher Nolan films and I have something of a varied history together. While I found Memento insulting, poorly-written, badly-researched, and generally wearing its total lack of knowledge regarding a key plot device on its sleeve, other Nolan films like Batman Begins have sort of redeemed him. In essence, this makes him a bit like the drunk uncle who occasionally has something of import or interest to say. In any case, The Prestige, an intriguing concept that escaped my notice during its theatrical run, is one of the more interesting pieces to come out of the major studios during 2006. Naturally, the title makes no sense to anyone who is unfamiliar with the profession of the central characters, but a masterfully-delivered monologue by Michael Caine explains it all in a manner that leaves one unable to help thinking that it all works beautifully. If nothing else, Nolan knows how to get the best from his actors, and in storytelling of any variety, that tends to be half of the proverbial battle. Especially in a film like this where the performances are central to the story.

The Prestige, named after the final stage of every magic act, concerns itself with a sibling-like rivalry between two stage magicians as portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The one point where the film lets them down is that their characters are so identical in nature that one is not really sure until the final act, and not even then in a way, which one is meant to be the hero. Perhaps this was intentional, although it does come off as a goofy accident. Nonetheless, for most of the film's length, we see the two attempt to one-up each other as they vie for the attention of a fickle London audience, performing sleights of hand and other such illusions in a time when stage performance was very much an industry like modern television. The clear difference between the two characters that drives much of the story is that one is a better magician while the other is a considerably better stage performer. Jackman and Bale sell their characters so well that the lack of distinction between actor and character becomes irrelevant.

So when I say that David Bowie performs the greatest trick of all during the film's running length by stealing the show, it is important to understand my full meaning. Bale and Jackman are performers at the top of their game, making films that cause the audience to rally behind them even when they are competing with more experienced or even better actors. This is a feat only a small percentage of today's acting pool are really capable of. Jackman in particular has accomplished the virtually impossible by making himself even more memorable than Sir Ian McKellen. So when Bowie walks into frame amidst a shower of lighting as Nikola Tesla, the classical misdirection here is that he is the most captivating and earnest performer. Recreating Tesla's seemingly insane experiments with AC electricity must have kept the special effects team up for weeks. But Bowie performs around them just as the real Tesla would sell them, by acting as if they were the most natural thing in the world. And Bowie even demonstrates they probably were to the real Tesla.

Hence, when Bowie is not in the frame, the film tends to lose an otherworldly spark that he exudes as naturally as sweat. Not that this is a detriment to the film in any sense. During many sequences, Jackman and Bale make it clear that to their characters, this is just another day at work. All the awe and wonder we feel when we witness a great magic trick or an awesome performance act, even one as ridiculous as that of the Tokyo Shock Boys, simply does not translate from the seats to the stage. The Prestige makes that so abundantly clear that we are left with little wonder that performing clowns can be such maladjusted or sombre characters when the show is over. In an age where not even the ability to capture audio-visual displays as a string of ones and zeros amazes us anymore, The Prestige gives us a rude reminder of just how jaded we have become. It has been a long time since the DVD-Video format has held me in the same wide-eyed wonder as when I first experienced it, but boy did Bowie's introductory shot come close.

At its heart, The Prestige is a story of obsession, a fact that is referenced in the dialogue so many times it might get monotonous to some viewers. Both Bale and Jackman seem consumed with the desire to show each other up that it makes the things they are willing to sacrifice in the process seem quite creepy. And the amazing thing is that it mostly works. With both characters appearing ready to sell out their own mothers to steal glory for a fleeting moment, it gives a whole new historical context to the invention of the American HDTV standard in order to snuff out the Japanese equivalent, and so forth. Whether the film industry would be in the comparative dire straits it is in today if all films worked so hard to create an illusory feel is probably irrelevant. What matters is that The Prestige destroys the argument that modern film does not make the effort to transport the audience. It shows the viewer something that they have not seen in quite this form before, and that is something of an achievement in an industry where it became all about the bottom line years ago.

I gave The Prestige an eight out of ten. Parts such as the first half-hour lost me, but the image of Bowie walking through lightning will be burned onto my brain forever. See it just for that.",8
12 July 2007,Wonderfully intricate story makes this one a winner,"Once you get all the twists and turns of the plot sorted out in your head (and doing so will undoubtedly require multiple viewings) only then will you really be able to appreciate just how brilliantly conceived the story in The Prestige is. Going back to their earlier film, Memento, writer/director Christopher Nolan, along with his co-writer and brother Jonathan, have shown a unique talent for creating mind-bending, thought-provoking films which leave you wanting to see them again and again to unravel all the story's mysteries. The Prestige may not quite be up to the level of Memento but it certainly stands in its own right as another superior effort by the brothers Nolan.

Probably the less said about the plot here the better. Better to allow you to unravel the story yourself. The basics...the story follows two magicians performing in Europe circa 1900. Initially friends they will soon become bitter rivals in a tale of true obsession. As presented in the film, the story jumps around in time which is a key piece of what in the end is a masterfully constructed puzzle. Because of the skewed time line, at times we know more than the characters and at other times we know less. It makes it all the more enjoyable when all the various story lines and time lines converge and finally we, and the film's characters, finally know the whole story.

As one might imagine just by looking at the cast list The Prestige is filled with tremendous performances. As the two key magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do a wonderful job of bringing their respective characters to life. Bale is perfect as the quiet, dark and brooding Alfred Borden while Jackman is similarly spot-on as the more showy and ultimately obsessive Robert Angier. Michael Caine is reliably brilliant in his supporting role as magician's assistant Cutter, inventor of illusions. Scarlett Johansson plays a stage assistant and while her role requires her to do little more than look pretty she is certainly up to that task and makes the most of what opportunities the script provides her. Everyone else in the wide and varied cast falls into their roles well, including David Bowie whose appearance as a brilliant scientist screams out ""stunt casting!"" but who performs his part wonderfully and fits right in with the rest of this terrific ensemble. A truly great cast really brings this story to life.

While the story is beautifully crafted the one minor quibble one may have is that this story doesn't have quite as much heart as say, The Illusionist, that other circa 1900 European magicians movie to come out in 2006. The Prestige no doubt has a better story, much more involved and complex. But while you can appreciate the story in The Prestige you may find it much more easy to embrace the story in The Illusionist. It's a subtle difference. Both films are tremendously well done and definitely well worth your while. If you're looking for a terrific story, one that will make you think, one that is ultimately surprising and thrilling, you will find few films which fit that bill better than The Prestige.",8
30 October 2006,Far to interesting for the average bum,"Now this was a movie that made you stop and think and then think again, and then go buy a ticket to watch again and think. Most of the people in the audience looked stupefied at the end of this flick. No greater tribute can be given for a movie based on magicians, magic, and science fiction. This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie.

Now, years later I decided to give it a rewatch, I can definitely say this- what an amazing film. The screenplay is strong, very mysterious and always keeps the audience second-guessing everything. The film is like a never ending maze. It has so many twists and turns, so many layers to it. Christopher Nolan really is a genius. I have considered his finest works Memento and The Dark Knight, but I can say this holds up to those films pretty much in every way. His direction is masterful and elegant. The performances are great, and the tragic rivalry between Angier and Borden and it's outcomes certainly are a great character study for each men. For me, I started with my own view of each character, and thought Angier was in the right from the start. However, as the film goes along, the film itself forces you to change sides and change your whole perspective on the characters. I thought this was really amazing and rarely does a film make you do that. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are very good, especially the former. Having seen her here and in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, she seems to be a great actress, and in each film she has outshined the still-talented Johansson. Having seen The Illusionist, I can say this is on a whole other level. The Illusionist was good, but entirely different besides the magician perspective. The Prestige is a perfect example of why we see films. We want to be entertained, we want to be mesmerized, and we want to be tricked and enchanted by the whole world a film brings you into. The Prestige is the ultimate trick!",
23 October 2006,"""The Prestige"" is lacking it","I'm a Hugh Jackman fan. A few years ago on a business trip to New York City,the hosting firm presented me with a top notch mezzanine seat to see him in the ""Boy from Oz."" Never did I see any single actor command a stage as he did. Hugh deserved every accolade awarded him. The show itself was quite good but Jackman was BETTER than the show. The problem is that this stage genius makes lousy movies and ""The Prestige"" proves it.

First of all, it cannot compare to this years excellent ""Illusionist."" Not even close. ""Prestige"" was filmed in the dark--by that I mean every scene was dank, dark,ominous,creepy, crawly and downright annoying. I felt like I was sitting in an unlit cellar. The plot was highly confusing. The English brogues were as thick as mud and difficult to understand. The acoustics was awful. They needed Tesla like a hole in the head. All those top hats lying around ranked stupider than stupid. Novocaine was better than the usually brilliant Michael Caine. With all these doubles, maybe triples running around, I felt as if I were at a World Series game. Scarlett Johansson was just a pretty face and figure--nothing more. As far as I was concerned, the movie was nothing more than a jumbled up confusing mess unworthy of my time and money.",1
19 August 2016,"Goes Deeper than Necessary,","The Prestige is a good movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a bizarre journey as we follow the lives of two competing magicians who go through extreme lengths to exceed the other. Things begin to heat up quite fast, with some very bizarre twists and turns throughout, showcasing the complications these magicians go through to make everything appear magic.

However. I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit.

I also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery.

Two magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation.

Best Performance: Christian Bale",7
19 March 2009,How many times can you double-cross your audience?,"In 1890s London, two magicians--once protégés of the same aging illusionist--consistently undercut each other on and off the stage, reveling in the one-upmanship; Hugh Jackman has the show business flair, while rough-hewn toughie Christian Bale is more intent on conquering the intricacies of unexplainable magic. Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****",6
24 March 2021,Amazing movie...,"""The Prestige"" is a Drama - Mystery in which we watch two stage magicians starting a battle one another after a tragic accident. Both of them want to be the best and to create the ultimate illusion that will capture the audience but both of them will have to make some sacrifices.

I enjoyed this movie very much because the plot was very interesting, in tense and combined very well mystery with drama. The direction which was made by Christopher Nolan was for one more time magnificent and he did an outstanding job on presenting his main characters and also the plot twists. The interpretations of both Hugh Jackman who played as Robert Angier and Christian Bale who played as Alfred Borden were simply amazing and the combination of them worked really well. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael Caine's who played as Cutter, Rebecca Hall's who played as Sarah and Scarlett Johansson's who played as Olivia Wenscombe. Finally, I have to say that ""The Prestige"" is an interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be simply amazed by it.",8
26 July 2023,I think the people who gave it an 8 need to rethink,"Just watched Oppenheimer and it made me come back to my favourite movie from Nolan.

The prestige is one of the best films I have ever watched and the best thing about it, is that it gets better and better everytime you watch it. Every scene ties in together and it's just so well worked.

The acting from Jackman and Bale is top class, the concept of the entire movie is fantastic and the ending will leave you dazed for days. Especially after first watching. Comparing it to his other films 1) prestige 2) inception 3) interstellar those are my top three Nolan films

By Christ if you haven't seen go do it now.

22 January 2019,"A Tight, Compelling Drama","22 October 2006. The script is tight, covering almost all of its bases along with a tense and character-driven drama surrounding loss and revenge, prestige and sacrifice. While the relational dramas unfolding appeared somewhat chaotic, part is explained by the plot itself. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale provide was wonderful performances as well as the mysterious David Bowie as Mr. Tesla as an added bonus. There are a few harsh magical moments. The flashbacks are handled nicely without obvious ostentation except where appropriate for the character and context. The ambiguity of Jackman's and Bale's characters is also commendable. Overall, this is a fine movie, but there are a few editing jumps and a bit of underdevelopment of characters that could have provided full-rounded enjoyment. However, such trifles could come down to deliberate necessity because of the plot twists. A surprisingly eerie, compelling delight. Eight out of Ten Stars.

6 November 2006,Sinister sleight of hand,"Cinema and stage magicians share a common secret about us, the viewers: we don't want to believe the reality - we enjoy the sensation of being transported to a world where we can gasp at the magic. ""The secret impresses no-one: the trick you use it for is everything."" Exploiting this parallel in a darkly sinister period piece, The Prestige weaves a tense and gripping tale of a fatal feud between two rival magicians.

In the skilfully recreated Victorian London, Director Christopher Nolan performs another sinister and chilling sleight of hand that forces us to look closely at every frame, just as we did in his backwards-moving masterpiece Memento (about a desperate man trying to avenge his wife's murder while suffering from the loss of all short-term memory). The two magicians (played by Bale and Jackman) are poised somewhere between being scientists and conmen and risk all for the secret of the greatest stage trick - and the two women in their lives weave in and out trying to discover the inner secrets of these men with whom they are involved. Seeing the story from several angles, the viewer shifts perspectives to work out what is real.

Almost like another conjuring trick, David Bowie, and to an extent all the actors except Michael Caine, are subsumed in their characters and barely recognisable at first glance. Caine, as the magician's ingeneur (the person who designs illusions behind the scenes) is a lynchpin, giving a powerful and convincing performance he can believe in. Scarlett Johansson, as the inexperienced but devoted magician's assistant, creeps up on us subtly and, thrown between the two main characters, is another one who might not be all she seems.

Cutter, (Michael Caine) explains the format: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secretyou won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" Gone is the image of the jolly magician. This is no Paul Daniels era of hocus pocus. If it goes wrong, things might get nasty. If it goes right, you are left with that gasp of amazement on your face that every magician craves and every filmmaker seeks. Perhaps the feeling is more important than deciding whether you actually want to find out or be fooled. Whodunnit or thriller, The Prestige is a rather clever piece of entertainment.",8
1 December 2020,Finally it took me till now to see this film. Really good,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

28 February 2019,Great Performances,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to his 6th and final movie of 2006, The Prestige.

Plot In A Paragraph: After a tragic accident, two stage magicians engage in a battle to create the ultimate illusion while sacrificing everything they have to outwit each other.

I watched this for the first time a few weeks ago!! With great performances, a second twist I never seen coming, I really enjoyed this movie.

It's not perfect, far from it, but I was engaged throughout, and at the end, I recommended it to a friend.

Prestige grossed $53 million at the domestic box office to end the year, as the 61st highest grossing movie of the year.",8
9 August 2021,What a movie!,"The movie is still very good years later. We can see two men wh o fight each other trough magic. And how dramatic this fight can be. This movie play with us and make us very careful about what we see. The twist at the end was brilliant. Very good movie overall.

15 April 2017,A dark magician battle,"After two magician apprentices have a deadly accident in one of their tricks and since then, a bitter rivalry is born between them. Having completely different lives and social positions but also many secrets, the two try to make a life out of magic in a desperate pursuit of the ultimate illusion. Sabotage and dirty hands play an important role in their work but with every failed act, their work but also characters greatly improve.

It's a very interesting movie which doesn't amaze you with its magic, but, on the contrary, with its plot, characters and especially, it's finale. It's very complex, extremely well thought and executed, its deep atmosphere drawing you slowly into its world.

It's a very good movie for magic lovers like myself, but also for people in search of mind boggling plots. A must see for everyone!

21 October 2006,Much better than the usual fair,"This was an unusual story, told and acted very well. It took me awhile (and I'm usually very quick) to see where it was going. Like the Illusionist it opens up many a moral dilemma for the audience. The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time. It might not be Number #1 this week at the box office but it's interesting enough that people will go see if for week after week.

11 September 2022,More Intricate Than Clever,"The Prestige is a bag of tricks, an enigma inside another that misdirects and, at least tries to, suprise you till the end. However, while it's certainly intricately put together it's more complex than clever. The core twist isn't that hard to guess and the only part you might not expect if you aren't to familiar with it is the aspect which classifies it as a fantasy. Although in a movie that's almost entirely 'real' it's almost out of place to inject sci-fi.

The film is told in a nonlinear fashion and combined with the fact that some parts are intentionally unclear it seems all over the place. While it spends the whole time traveling through time and piecing the story together, it's not till the last third that it truly kicks into gear. The majority of what's before is mostly backstory and magic shows(which even as something of an amateur one, I can say gets to be redundant and boring).

The cast of the film is stacked with big names ranging from Christian Bale who's one of the finest actors of his time, to Hugh Jackman who's well cast here and the ever enduring Michael Caine. Which works well in a movie that's so focused on characters. The plot is centered around a rivalry but both the characters are rather unlikable and you can't pull for either though it ultimately lands on Christian Bale as its hero.

The Prestige never pulls you in too deep nor does it floor you with its shocking reveals, but there's always something perplexing about it and it's a proffesional production.",5

16 April 2013,"A tale of misdirection, bitter rivalry and incapability to deal with loss","What I've always admired about Christopher Nolan is his ability to make even the most extraordinary tales and people seem believable. Here we have a story about two stage magicians, set in the late 19th century - or possibly the early 20th - where they try to outdo each other with outlandish magic tricks and performances. Throw in some scifi elements, or at least storytelling aspects, near the end and you have a tale that's very out there. But it's told very close to earth, with identifiable characters, none of which is the outright villain or even the protagonist. The story is mainly told from Angier's (Hugh Jackman) perspective, but there are bits here and there that show us the viewpoint of Borden (Christian Bale), which keeps the story grounded and allow us to see that that neither of these men are completely right in their quest for revenge and recognition. One can of course argue in either direction, but the matter of the fact is that both of them were given the chance to stop, but they didn't take it, which allows the story to exist, yes, but which also makes it a bitter one.

So that's one aspect that absolutely works. There are many more, such as the characters themselves, or perhaps I should say the main duo, Angier and Borden. The rest of the cast isn't bad - with Michael Caine being the everlasting beacon of solid performing - but Jackman and Bale are the main attraction of this film. They work off each other beautifully and they truly took these characters and ran with them.

Add in some real twists and genuine surprises and you have one of those timeless stories in your hands. This is a story that could be told over and over again in many forms, and it'd still work. It has great themes, clearly defined acts and above all else it's captivating. Still, given the magician aspect, I believe that it works in the given time period perfectly and the late 19th century is showcased beautifully.

So what doesn't work, you might ask? Well, most of it does work, but as I stated, there are some slight leanings towards science fiction near the end, which I thought were unneeded or at least distracting. They do allow for the story to reach its logical conclusion and give us some really disturbing scenes, but it's still weird to see such stuff in a film where there were none before. A deliberate choice in this case, true, but it doesn't come off as well as it should. Still, more of a matter of taste than a real flaw.

All in all I really like this film. It's solid from start to finish, with great characters and even greater story. One of Nolan's better ones and that's saying something.",10

19 July 2023,Gripping and unpredictable thriller,"The Prestige is a gripping thriller about a spiralling obsession that brings out the worst in people, hiding its greatest twists in plain sight and it absolutely demands multiple viewings. For all its cynicism and violence, it still reaffirms that Christopher Nolan is a deeply empathetic filmmaker deep down.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are terrific as the central rival magicians. Jackman starts off in fine charismatic before descending into much more despicable territory. Bale pushes his character's morality to the limits whilst still being the more human of the two and adds a duality enhanced by repeat viewings.

Christopher Nolan's direction is amazing. The film is presented in his trademark non-chronological structure that keeps it consistently engaging and unpredictable, with both Bale and Jackman fighting for dominance and only able to briefly holding onto it before being usurped by the other. The period setting is flawless, especially impressive when only operating on a mid-budget.",10

8 June 2008,Devastating. You will be completely immersed.,"A lot of words come to mind upon seeing this again, and amongst them are ""brilliant,"" ""devastating,"" ""masterful"" and ""diabolical."" The Prestige, for those so shamefully uninitiated, is a pretty much completely perfect film, taking the viewer down a dark, twisted road of revenge, lies and deceit as two former friends destroy each other.

There isn't a whole lot wrong with this, and when I said back in March that The Illusionist was better than this, I must not have remember just how good this was. The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation.",10

3 March 2007,one of the best of 2006,"Christopher Nolen further proves that he's definitely a writer/director to look out for with this excellent tale of feuding magicians. Without naming any actors specifically, they're all uniformly great in this film. I was captivated from beginning to end and that in itself is pretty impressive and no mean feat. The fact that none of the actors were even nominated for this years Oscars is a mild travesty as it's definitely one of the best acted films I'd seen in 2006. And yes the ending can be seen coming a whiles away if one's paying even the mildest of attention, but that doesn't really detract from the experience one iota. It's definitely not a feel good movie to say the least, but it's simply superb.

22 March 2018,Underrated and Underseen,"Along with INSOMNIA, the 2006 film that Nolan directed, THE PRESTIGE is probably one of his least known and least viewed films and that is too bad for it is a wonderful motion picture that proves he is a strong director with a strong vision.

Dubbed ""The Warring Magicians"" film, THE PRESTIGE stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as two 19th Century Magicians who are...well...at war with each other. Of course, they started out as partners, but soon became enemies, each trying to out do each other and to discover the other magician's secrets.

Cleverly written by Nolan and his frequent collaborator, his brother Jonathan Nolan - and based on the novel by Christopher Priest, THE PRESTIGE will keep you guessing throughout, trying to figure out ""how they did it"" and are constantly being surprised by double turns, back stabbing and second guessing.

Bale, by this time in his career, has established himself as a powerful actor - and he shines here. Joining Bale is Nolan regular Michael Caine as the mentor of the two magicians, a young-ish Scarlett Johannsen as a a woman who falls in love with both of them (of course) and Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo as Bale's and Jackman's wives, respectively. But...the surprise to me in this film when I first saw it - and again when I recently re-viewed it - is the performance of Hugh Jackman. This film shows that Jackman is more than just Wolverine - that dude can act. As a magician, he is showing glimpses of being ""THE GREATEST SHOWMAN"" (but that is another movie for another day) and more than holds his own against a fierce Bale. Finally...special notice needs to be made to the actor who portrays inventor Nikola Tesla - perfectly cast in this role is Ziggy Stardust himself, David Bowie. It's a shame that Bowie did not act in more films for he captures the screen in the brief appearances he makes in this film.

As for Nolan - he is now coming into his own as a Director. The action is fast paced, the twists and turns are ""honestly"" played, the composition of the pictures on the screen are interesting and beautiful to look at and I walked away satisfied.

If you haven't seen THE PRESTIGE (or if you haven't seen it in awhile) - check this one out. You'll be glad you did.

7 March 2020,Quintessential Nolan,"A Nolan film with Bale, Jackman, and ScarJo... why am I only watching this in 2020!? I'm glad that I finally took the plunge and watched this mysterious and intriguing film, telling the tale of two magicians on a quest to one up the other, never knowing when enough is enough.

What really drew me in about The Prestige was its originality. At it's core it was a tale of betrayal and revenge, but it was wrapped up in a rather novel and unique package which continually piqued my interest.

The performances throughout were solid, which is to be expected from any Nolan film. I particularly doff my cap to ScarJo for her respectable attempt at a British accent.

One draw back for me was the non-linear story telling. At times this benefited the story, however at others it did seem a tad confusing and perhaps had it been told in a linear fashion the story could have flowed more and some twists could have had a stronger impact.

The direction was typical Nolan - masterful and carefully considered, adding to the atmosphere of mystery.

This was a well paced film with the plot ramping up toward an exciting if somewhat predictable conclusion. This is where I return to my criticism of the non-linear storytelling - I feel that this could have been used more effectively to disguise the prestige of the final trick and deliver a more shocking ending.

The Prestige was a thoroughly enjoyable and unique film which delivered an interesting and twisting plot through believable and well though out characters.",9
12 February 2007,Magic Show,"Antici..................................pation!

( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)

The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)

The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences.

The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.

Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it.

This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.

Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.

THE PRESTIGE was really magic.",9
11 March 2019,Do you believe in Magic?,"The Prestige: 9 out of 10: Two magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) develop a deadly rivalry that threatens them both.

Some days I don't get critics. This is a fantastic film with a wonderfully twisty story, incredible acting, and excellent period detail. Yet it sits at a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. One of Christopher Nolan's worse as director. The bloated Dark Knight Rises sits at an 87%

It is a bit of a head-scratcher. It did come out during particularly good run of films in the theater ( Scorsese's The Departed, Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers) and it wasn't the only costume drama attacked that weekend (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette was savaged by critics) Some people didn't like the end but I think it is more than a bit brilliant. One caveat is that I did like the film more on repeat viewings after a little time had passed. I can see how the initial reaction might be slightly harsher.

Still, The Prestige has easily recovered and sits comfortably in the IMDB top 250 a couple of spaces from The Departed. (Time has not been as kind to Flags of our Fathers which is all but forgotten.... However, Marie Antoinette has also picked up some fans over the years and is bordering on a cult classic.)

I am not talking about The Prestige simply because I don't want to spoil it. It is that good and should be seen with fresh eyes. Okay, one more hint it has the second best David Bowie casting ever.",9
27 October 2019,Nolan's writing masterpiece! One time is simply not enough.,"This movie is beyond brilliant. I never payed that much attention to it the first two or three times I watched it on TV, but god, oh god, is it worth watching again! Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can.

30 January 2022,Masterful!,"Christopher Nolan's intelligent rivalry between two magicians is unpredictably twist after twist. The Prestige just happens to be the amazing result of Christopher Nolan executing an extremely intriguing concept he co-wrote with his brother, Jonathan Nolan. When the Nolan brothers work together, they usually end up constructing a very fine and crowd-pleasing story. And The Prestige is one of them.

This is a very moving and smart mystery sort of drama-thriller with talented performances delivered from Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, about a tragic accident that leaves Bale Jackman's greatest enemy. The film's pacing is briefly slow but mostly solid, and the story is really easy to get engaged with.

However, it's hard to describe the movie's intelligence in its twist-after-twist matter without dropping some severe spoilers you're not gonna wanna head into the movie with. You just have to watch it yourself. Thankfully, The Prestige is also not a film that's a complete pain to watch again, considering the little details you'll discover each rewatching.

20 November 2007,To Live the Third Act,"""The Prestige"" will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.

In the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret.

Thanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the ""living"" on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.

Michael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.

It's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.

Watch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved. Just let the magic flow.",9
30 December 2006,Nolan's Real Magic.,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",9
6 November 2014,Are You Watching Closely?,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.

The Prestige is another one of Christopher Nolan's non-linear films that gets better after every time you watch it. It's one of the reasons his films make incredible amounts of money. They require you to go back to the theater and re-watch the film any number of times. I love everything about The Prestige. It has two of my favorite film characters of all time in Alfred Borden and Robert Angier. Both are incredibly deep characters that seek power and legacy. They are rival magicians who get caught up in besting the other and tend to lose people closest to them along the way.

It's non-linear structure works to it's benefit by showing flashbacks and flash forwards of them reading each other's diary which has the many tricks each of them have used. As we find out more about each character, we find out that it's become a lot more personal between the two than we previously thought. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give terrific performances that have become a bit understated. But the men aren't the only ones who give great performances, as Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall give incredibly powerful performances as well. Hall hadn't been in any big movie to this point so her ability to hold her own up against Bale and Jackman is unprecedented. Scarlett is as sexy as ever but also surprisingly effective as an assistant to both of them at various points in the film. It's another film that you don't really want to know a lot going in without being spoiled. All I can say is, you will be shocked enough to press play again once the credits roll.

Nolan's work here (in only a few month shoot & production) is impeccable. He is quite simply one of the greatest storytellers we have today and has an incredible knack for interweaving multiple story lines and a complicated script into something extraordinary. He's also the best at ending a story. Every one of the endings to his films have been perfect and stayed true to his respected characters. I hope Interstellar gives us another memorable ending for the ages.

+Bale & Jackman

+Friendship that became a rivalry

+Nolan's effective non-linear structure

+Hall & Johansson's powerful performances

+That ending though..

22 March 2007,The Prestige- Don't Need this Type of Honor 1/2*,"Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.

As two magicians, one's mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman's wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.

Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show ""The Nanny."" Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.

The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.

The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.

Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don't run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening.",1
11 September 2016,"Christopher Nolan's dark fantasy piece is smart, dazzling, but a little meandering","The main purpose of magic is not to impress others nor to deceive them, but to simply give the illusion of something fake appear real for artistic purposes. That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine). But one night during a show, their performance goes terribly wrong that results in tragedy. The fateful event turns their duo's friendship into a bitter rivalry and soon leads to the two in an obsessive battle to discover each other's secrets. It's not long before their heated rivalry escalates into a downward spiral of deceit that threatens to not only tear apart their careers on stage, but their own personal beings.

As this film deals with magic and sorcery, it should come to no surprise that Christopher Nolan brings a wide plethora of twists to the mix; and with a smoothly compelling script and striking visual resonance, Nolan appears to be at the top of his game. Wielding with spectacular directorial talent, Nolan drives this film with plenty of nuance and astounding visual potency. As the story revolves around a heated competition of revenge and deception that makes for some very dark and occasionally morbid moments, it pulls into a dark, eerie journey of Christopher Priest's novel with plenty of surprises supplemented by Nolan's stylish direction. Though the plot holds a fair amount of intelligence, the unnecessarily slow pacing does tend to kill the interest of the story. Instead of introducing the lead magicians at the beginning, the film proceeds through a non-linear narrative opening with Christian Bale's character Alfred on murder trail (for reasons you don't learn until later) which becomes intertwined throughout the story until the very end, before giving us the proper introduction on the characters. Along with this another subplot centering on famous inventor Nikola Tesla who's oddly played by singer David Bowie, trying to invent a teleporter. Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling not only overcomplicates the plot, but he doesn't execute in a way that is effective as what he achieved in 'Memento'. On the bright side, this director manages to keep things moving at least most of the time, and builds up the story up to a shocking, unpredictable conclusion. The performances by Christian Bale , fresh off of Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and Hugh Jackman both stand out; and the supporting cast including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as Robert Angier's assistant also make great appeal in their roles. While nothing particularly Oscar-worthy, these actors manage to fit the bill.

The Prestige, though slightly inferior to Christoper Nolan's other works, is a smart, dazzling fantasy period piece with alluring energy of Nolan's directorial efforts and a fine array of charismatic performances by a likable cast. Though the level of complexity in the plot make the story a challenge for the most naive film goers to sit through, it also serves as a reminder of the fine cinematic talent Nolan never stops bringing to the screen.",7
17 July 2008,Absolutely engrossing.,"The Prestige is a rare film in its own right for the simple fact that it completely engrosses the audience into the story for nearly the entire 130 minute running time and refuses to let go until the finale is revealed. What starts out simple enough turns into a story so complex and layered, it requires multiple viewings to catch everything. First off, the acting must be convincing to keep the audience paying attention, which it pulls off tremendously. Hugh Jackman carries his role very well, Michael Caine is a pleasure to watch, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson also hold their own. The best performance, though, is that of Christian Bale, who also plays the most volatile and eccentric character. Every scene he is in he dominates and it is pretty difficult to pay attention to anything but him.

As the story unfolds, we find out a rivalry has come between Jackman and Bale, and they continue to sneak into each other's shows as well as pull dirty tricks in order to learn the other's secrets and ruin him. This is the bulk of the film, and the last 20-30 minutes try and bring everything to light. Many fans have argued that this film cheats with its climax and that director/co-writer Christoper Nolan does this to duck out of anything to complicated or difficult. Those who do, however, are looking at it all wrong. Nolan gives us even more questions after the film concludes, and it takes multiple viewings to understand all the interactions and motivations of each character. Even after you may understand what actually occurred in the story, questions will still raise in your mind about the clarity and realism of these conclusions.

In short, this is a near-masterpiece from one of the most talented directors this generation. Nolan is working with incredible powers of the cinema here. The entire plot is told completely out of order, yet it is never confusing or convoluted. Everything here holds up, and while questions certainly will be raised about the nature of the story, no one can doubt the undeniable storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan. It is mostly for entertainment, but it also shows what bitter hatred and obsession with revenge can do to a man. This is truly film making at its finest art form.",9
17 November 2006,Raising the stakes in this tale of illusions and revenge,"Director Christopher Nolan has gone from quirky,disturbing mystery director(Following,Memento)to mind f--er(Insomnia) to dark action movie director(Batman Begins)and with the Presitge,back to mind f--er.

One-time friends,cohorts and now rival magicians in Victorian England,Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman,who seems to be in everything lately)and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale,returning to his native accent)engage in a war of out-doing each other and,possibly,doing harm to each other as they try to outwit and out-perform each other,both looking to perfect and improve upon the art of creating the perfect illusion. The fuel for their rivalry isn't entirely in their heads:Borden's inexplicable inability to save Angier's wife(Piper Perabo)from a botched escape routine has set Angier out to make his act not just an act but a personal vendetta to destroy Borden,and Angier's ruining of Borden's first public performance(along with part of Borden's right hand),steels Borden to sabotage and monitor his old chum's performances.Years later,when it appears that Borden has found a way to near-flawlessly perform the ""Transported Man"" routine,Angier goes to great lengths--specifically,the mountains of Colorado--to look up charismatic and mysterious inventor Nikola Tesla(a saturnine,mesmerizing and brunette David Bowie)to help with a contraption that will enhance the act. The contraption proves to be a much more powerful device,one that threatens to destroy whomever uses it. Or does it?

The neat thing,to me,about magic/con movies is that they always challenge the viewer to keep up with it. They may not always succeed,but they at least try to keep the viewer from being passive. Such is the case with this film,which is visually enchanting and acted nicely. The leads,in particular,are studied and focused as increasingly bitter rivals. Michael Caine is fantastic as their mentor,a sage and patient man who senses that he has little power over what's about to happen and merely wants to stay out of the way. The lovely Scarlett Johnnson makes the most out of her late addition character,an attractive magician's assistant who is brought up by Angier but finds herself smitten with Borden.

Mood and atmosphere are important here,and this film makes the most of it. It may not be perfect,and it did seem like it left a few too many plot lines to dangle,but overall,it was effective,and that's what should count. As one of the lines in the movie exhorts you the viewer to do:watch closely.",9
25 May 2023,Are you looking closely?,"I was watching TV until I got to a channel where they were advertising that they were going to play this movie and after watching the cast, I got interest and decided to watch it. Even though it's a Nolan movie and it had actors like Christian bale and Michael in the cast the story looked pretty simple and this would just be a fun movie to watch. I was so wrong. This movies plot is way more dense that what the trailers and promotions show. The acting is perfect and the writing and direction are as good. The way the plot twists fit perfectly on the story and the fact they actually relation the story to the time where it happens is brilliant. It's a movie that we do not see that often and a definite must watch.

6 April 2007,Really dark and twisted...,"Christopher Nolan's latest offering from his brother's story is not only a dark and thrilling adventure filled with mysterious plot twists but also a brilliant character study. The two leading characters are written wonderfully and their style of never-ending rivalry was really a pleasure to watch. Their contrasting style as magicians, their markedly different points of view were really designed well. It was an interesting take on how success changed their lives in two different manners.

Like the characters they play, the two leading actors also constantly kept on trying to outshine each other. Jackman pulls off a very convincing and controlled performance as Angier, the perfect entertainer. But I must say it's Christian Bale who steals the show as the mysterious Alfred who never lets out a secret until it's time. His character has so many dimensions and his performance is just utterly flawless. You can see mystery in his eyes and smell it in his words.

Among the other actors, Michael Caine again delivers a purely professional supporting role. Scarlett Johansson as Olivia is somewhat one-dimensional and she did not receive the best dialogues too. It was fun to watch David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. I think he does a fair job to this sort of off-beat character.

Nolan's direction is the major thing which makes this film tick. He spreads the story into several non-linear segments and although it might seem confusing to the audience to follow the plot in this different time-period segments, it successfully enhances the atmosphere of mystery. The plot twists are never rushed and each takes its own time to grow. Although I didn't like the absurd basic idea behind the true explanation of 'transported man'... still the ending is excellently executed.

May the Nolans keep this quality up.",8
18 October 2006,Roma Film Festival - the Prestige: ultimately unconvincing,"""The Prestige"" has everything a film need to be great: two lead actors named Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, for the first time together, a supporting cast including Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansonn - I felt Johansonn was kind of useless here, though - and the direction of acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much. Maybe's my fault, but I was expecting much more. My rating is 6/10",6
22 February 2007,Revenge To The End,"If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be ""dark"" and ""twisted."" Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.

Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.

Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.

The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails ""getting one's hands dirty."" Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.

Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.

The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.

Many may be able to figure out ""the big secret"" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.",9
24 March 2007,"Good show, but just short of true magic.","In some sense, you can consider The Prestige Christopher Nolan's return to his Memento tricks after his bat-movie excursion. Working again with his writer-brother Jonathan, Nolan brings us back to a movie that spins and whirs with movie magic, but as much as I'm impressed by the presentation of the film, I feel like somewhere along the way, the film lost its heart. Let me explain.

The basic setup is this: Two young magicians become bitter and deadly rivals after a trick goes wrong. When we start the movie, we hear Michael Caine telling us the basics of magic. There's the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Nolan (or shall I say Nolans?), trickster that he is, takes this concept of magic and uses it as the structure to the film as well. This is akin to how Nolan built his narrative structure in Memento around the memory loss concept, but in The Prestige, the story is told far more straightforwardly than its predecessor, even with all of its twists and turns.

Yes, this is a movie about magic, like its recent colleague The Illusionist and like what you'd expect from a film about magic, things aren't as they seem in the film. But the Prestige left enough clues early on that a well-read kid like me could pick up on all the twists and turns before they came. Fortunately, the film still manages to be quite fun even if you know what's coming up because the presentation of the film is quite enjoyable. Nolan has this stony directorial style that bathes everything in a shade of cool, which works really well for movies about bat-themed crusaders and yes, even about magic.

On the downside, the film spends so much time trying to be tricky that I think it misses out a little on the tragedy of the two characters. Not to say that it doesn't touch on it, but I feel the overall film would've benefited a bit from focusing just a little less on the ""ooh, I'm so clever"" turns and a little more on the different effects of obsession on the main characters and its consequences on their lives. By the time the credits rolled, I saw that the film was trying, but it wasn't enough to get me at a visceral level. There was too much cool, too much showmanship and it was all very entertaining, but I saw hints of a really good drama underlying it all and I think it got lost a little in all the show.

I loved the period stuff, I loved that Nikola Tesla was put in the film, played surprisingly well by rocker David Bowie. The minor characters and the major characters, I felt, were all played well and the direction was clear. I do have to admit that I probably would've been even more impressed by the film if I wasn't able to peek behind the wizard's curtain and figure things out too early. And unlike The Illusionist, this film does resolve its magic, so you're not left unsatisfied by an ambiguous story.

The other problem I had with the story is that it was hard to develop sympathy for the main characters once they started battling. What they do doesn't draw sympathy anymore because there doesn't seem to be much left to redeem--both characters become shells of men and there's nothing left for me to hope for. Despite the fact that we are given the perspective of Hugh Jackman's character, I found myself just as much concerned (even though it wasn't much) for Christian Bale's character. But since both characters have such despicable traits and neither seems to really manage to overcome them or add a real dimension of humanity to them, they become a little two-dimensional.

But still, I was genuinely entertained, just by the impressive presentation and storytelling. And it's a rather enjoyable film about magic. I was just let down because the setup had potential to be a little more and it didn't seize it. A rather enjoyable film, but not great. 8/10.",8

Do not miss!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way.

14 July 2007,Work of art,"Despite the similarities and the release timing, this movie is very different from ""The Illusionist"" in that it is more of a character study into very obsessive individuals as well as an adventurous, exciting and intriguing example of what film-makers can achieve if they really try.

The performances are outstanding, the storyline complex enough to keep you guessing till the end. There are some really quite clever plot twists and surprises.

Im happy to say that I didn't ""work it out"" until the various revelations.

Very well made and thoroughly enjoyable; a thinking persons film.

17 July 2022,Magic can betray,"A ruthless movie that shows what a man is willing to do for success and fame. Everything ends up in the background: love, family, one's life. The obsession with prestige and risk lead to disaster but there are some willing to take that path.

28 July 2023,You will never know what will happen next!!!,"Mind-bending and spellbinding masterpiece that weaves a gripping tale of rivalry, obsession, and deception.

First and foremost, the performances by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are nothing short of extraordinary. Their portrayal of rival magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden is captivating and layered. Jackman's Angier exudes charm and determination, while Bale's Borden embodies a quiet intensity that keeps you guessing throughout the film.

The intricate and cleverly crafted plot is a testament to Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a storyteller. The Prestige is a puzzle of timelines and narrative layers, keeping you engaged and guessing until the final reveal. The film's non-linear storytelling adds an element of mystery and intrigue that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

As the rivalry between Angier and Borden escalates, the film explores the theme of obsession and the lengths to which these magicians are willing to go for the perfect illusion. It delves into the sacrifices made for greatness, blurring the lines between hero and villain.

The supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and Rebecca Hall, deliver strong performances that add depth and complexity to the story. Caine's portrayal of Cutter, a mentor to both magicians, brings a sense of wisdom and guidance to the narrative.

The film's production design and cinematography are stunning, capturing the dark and mysterious atmosphere of Victorian-era London. The visually striking sequences of magic tricks are a spectacle to behold, enhancing the film's themes of illusion and deception.

Hans Zimmer's haunting and atmospheric score adds an extra layer of intrigue and drama to the storytelling.

In conclusion, The Prestige is a cinematic gem that leaves you in awe of its cleverness and depth. With outstanding performances, a brilliantly crafted plot, and a captivating exploration of rivalry and obsession, it's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.

If you're a fan of mind-bending thrillers that challenge your perception and keep you guessing until the very end, The Prestige is a must-watch. It's a masterclass in storytelling and a mesmerizing journey into the world of magic, mystery, and obsession. So, prepare to be amazed and enthralled by the spellbinding brilliance !!!!",10
21 October 2006,One of the Smartest Films Recently,"The Prestige is a film founded upon wit and intellectual conflicts. The Nolans don't want to challenge the audience as much as they just want the audience to know how brilliant they are. And they are! The Prestige is spectacularly brilliant and full of terrific surprises and excellent twists. For any moviegoer who gets a great kick out of a battle of wits, a game of revenge, and an all-around sneaky plot full of schemes and cons and tricks, The Prestige is the movie of the year for you.

The cast is very convincing, especially the two leads and Caine, who after half a century in movies will never become too weather-beaten to pack a punch, enjoying the tricks they play on us as much as Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are. The Nolans, though they love to show off a bit, in this case by tacking one too many surprises, they are not yet on the road to self- indulgence like many of today's most impressive auteurs like Shyamalan for instance. They will no doubt be knocked by a few critics by Christopher's use of elaborate, multi-layered nonlinear plot structure, telling two flashbacks at the same time while driving the story with the present day. Following, Memento, and even Batman Begins have flaunted the nonlinear technique to the point where, like Tarantino, they will be accused of using it as a gimmick. However, this technique comes in very handy in building the tension in the story. The film is somehow able to surprise the audience after its already shown us the outcome of something.

Once again, it spills a little overboard with its twists and turns once it's satisfied the audience with a dazzlingly brilliant climax, but overall, the film is brilliant and weaves one of the finest suspense threads in awhile.",9
18 August 2007,"""Prestige"" has amazing twists, amazing reveal","What makes ""The Prestige"" so different from other films is that the storyline is so fresh and original. So many times we have seen stories about a secret agent on the run or superheroes saving the world. But the Prestige concerns two magicians obsessed with mastering the new arts of magic tricks, and their obsession, even to the death, to figure them out before the other.

Christopher Nolan's film-noir style brings a very brooding and ominous feel to the film, which in the end, turns out to be very deathly and the audience realizes that the climax has been met by a series of lies.

Yet, when you feel like you understand what is happening in the plot, either a twist occurs or you reach the end of the film realizing that much that has happened was a lie anyway. This may be an ambiguous way to describe the events of ""The Prestige-"" but this is indeed the way the movie goes, until you are left at the end full of additional questions that you thought you already had the answer to- and want to see it again as soon as possible! 4/4 stars",9
18 November 2006,Masterclass,"Two friends start out as aides to a popular magician, but soon become professionals themselves. This starts a trek along a path that will lead to rivalry, surprising revelations about their work, betrayal, and murder.

Once again, Christopher Nolan proves to be a great director of thrillers. Not just plot wise with the winding and ever surprising story, but with also with the intricate visual appeal and masterclass acting. Like the visual comic book feast ""Batman Begins"" this darkly toned, but highly enjoyable thriller puts you into another world, that feels familiar, but is top-notch escapist entertainment also. The winding plot, which actually incorporates historical and scientific fact, is one of the best in years and will keep you hooked from the first to last scene. Also, everyone has seen little table magic tricks like doves appearing out of nowhere, but this film really draws you in to the world of magic as not only a performing art, but an art of shameless lies and illusion. A world where reality and illusion literally collide and become one and the same.

Terrific cast. Terrific script. Terrific direction. Terrific film. 10/10

Rated PG-13 for violent content",10
1 June 2007,A little bit of Nolan,"I told myself that I would watch this movie once more before writing about it. I have already done it, and this is what I have: Christopher Nolan has done four very good and very different films; ""Memento"", ""Insomnia"", ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige"". That the last one is a little better than the previous ones only shows his continuing growth as a writer and director. While ""Memento"" was a complex tale about an amnesic man's mind and ""Batman Begins"" a brave new beginning of the famous franchise; ""The Prestige"" is the adaptation of a novel about the world of magic.

Written alongside his brother Jonathan, the director's script doesn't take long to get us inside this world where we want to believe everything; that world of tricks and illusions. ""Are you watching closely?"", a voice off screen asks as soon as the film's first frame appears; and if you don't listen or pay attention to this, you probably won't understand the story. The question is also an indirect invitation to pay attention to how the movie looks, thanks to Wally Pfister's incredible cinematography.

Followed by the mentioned question, an inspired Michael Caine gives a speech concerning the three steps that complete a magic trick, while he does one to a little girl. This girl is a fundamental piece of the plot, but we find that out later. The way in which Nolan's direction and writing combine to, little by little, give way to new developments of the plot, is one of the points that show the filmmaker's improvement.

It's enough saying that ""The Prestige"" is about an eternal competition between two magicians, each one excellent in their own way: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackmam) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, on the way to become a Nolan regular). And you must trust me when I tell you that such competition ends up consuming their lives; ruining the ones of the ones around them.

This relationship of admiration, mixed big time with obsession, envy and resentment; can be perfectly seen in the performances the main actors assume. Being separated and meeting face to face rarely throughout the movie, is like they know each other by heart and they can look at each other; in moments where the plot puts them in different times, because the film deals with three different situations (in different times) at the same time.

If you hadn't considered Hugh Jackman as talented until now, or if you had seen him as a guy with luck, ""The Prestige"" is the place to discover his interpretative power and become conscious of the talent he is. And Bale, he easily steals the show with another performance full of his own unforgettable elements. The presence of both is so strong that Scarlett Johansson, generally a main attraction, is clearly unnoticed.

When the movie is over, you'll have a feeling of dissatisfaction that will make you want to see it again. I know that it happened to Matsan and it happened to me too. I couldn't do it because I saw the film in the cinema, but if you rent it don't think twice and do it because it's worth it: ""The Prestige"" is a cinematographic pearl.",9

10 April 2020,Very complicated but worth it 7/10,"The movie it self was a tough one to understand. Maybe the first 30 minutes are hard but once you figured out the characters, the plot, the background and so forth. You see nolan is responsible for a really good feature. Both Christian bale are hugh Jackman are fantastic in their portrayals and Michael Caine is even better. I really liked that even if it's not based on a true story then it involved real characters such as nicola Tesla and adison. Great portrayal of David Bowie. The plot is complicated but I enjoyed how the characters outsmarted each other in every occasion. Great job nolan.

16 March 2007,Real Magic...,"The Prestige is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is totally unique, keeps you gripped throughout and the plot is so clever and original. You don't see many films about magicians, maybe thats why I found this to be so interesting, and I doubt we'll ever see a better one. The film is not really about magic though. It is about obsession. It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn.

""I need to know his secret."" ""Why?"" ""So I can do it better.""

By the end, it is difficult to tell who you are supposed to be rooting for, because both main characters aren't exactly good guys, and I think this makes the film very unique. It is not about good triumphing over evil, rather it is about how you can get so caught up in one thing that it rules the rest of your life, and the dangers of becoming obsessed.

The acting in the film is superb. If you went to see a professional magician, you'd see the showmanship and antics that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman perform in The Prestige. The special effects are fantastic, as are the illusions that are performed. Michael Caine is, as always, brilliant. He is still proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent.

Christopher Nolan's direction is, obviously, brilliant. This is a fantasy film, and he has still made it look completely real. I also think his screenplay for all of his films, especially this one, is the best by anybody. Never does he just put things in front of you to watch. The non-chronological order he uses means that as you go along, any questions you may have are answered along the way, and this makes for a wonderful cinematic experience. I think this sets his films apart from other directors'. In summary, I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan is the real magician here.",10
8 March 2021,Great showmen at their finest,"The Prestige was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Christian Bale,Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson ,Rebecca Hall ,David Bowie and Andy Serkis. It tells the story of two rival magician who after a tragic accident spend their lives trying to upstage one another, While trying learning each others secrets. where the movie greatest strength wise is between the performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman really deliver on the whole rivals competing of one another. The rivalry becomes soul intuitive with each others lives that there ended up sacrifice in their social lives and sabotaging one another to the point that they even show up in disguises. The choice to set it in the 19 century was a good decision given that this was the golden age of showman and magicians, The production design is wonderful,costumes are appropriate for the time. The film has a sense of disbelief which plays well off of its theme it constantly has you surprised on what happens next. it does not play out the way that you would probably expect it. The prestige Is a compelling tale of obsession and revenge that delivers on the showmanship an excellent film with a remarkable cast.",8
23 March 2007,I wish I could give 11.,"If I could be granted one wish it would be that I could give The Prestige an 11 rating. It's an outstanding movie, far from anything you've ever seen. At first, my only motives for seeing this movie were seeing it with this kid I liked and because I'm madly in love with Christian Bale. I didn't pay much attention to my date. I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is ""storytelling at it's best."" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it. This is hands-down, thumbs-up, one of the best movies I have ever seen and I'm exceptionally proud to call myself a fan of Christian Bale and The Prestige.",10

11 January 2012,My Favorite Nolan,"Yes, TDK was unbelievably awesome. Yes, Inception was original and awesome. No, neither of them is Nolan's masterpiece (to date). That title belongs to The Prestige, at least in my opinion. Featuring an amazing pairing of Jackman and Bale, and the hot off of critical failure Insomnia, Nolan's movie scorches from the beginning. Putting Tesla in as a historical anchor was pure brilliance, and with the aid of Tesla technology most of the illusions they pulled off could easily be done, even the shocking ending(s). Therefore, despite what some might say, this is all entirely realistic.

In fact, I think Nolan would be smart to re-visit Tesla and do a biopic, because there are few people as insanely weird and full of pure genius, in history, as Tesla was.

On the surface, this is a simple magician versus magician period piece, but it slowly evolves into a battle of wit between two incredibly driven men. The twists in this movie, the first time viewing, are nearly impossible to predict (unlike Inception/TDK), and everything comes together perfectly. One of the most under-rated movies, ever.",10
25 May 2023,The Metaphor of Human Alienation and the Expression of Desire Paranoia,"This is a story without a winner. Because whether it is the absolute worship of success or the inability to give up on hatred, it is destined that this game will never die, the soul will never dissipate, until one party pays a fatal price.

Fatal is never magic, fatal is always the darkness of the human heart who does everything to succeed.

The setting of the film is in the Victorian era, which not only brings in exquisite and complex costumes, gorgeous and flashy stage backgrounds, and bizarre and psychedelic stories, but also creates an illusion of a distant distance - that is, the restlessness and loss of the human heart that only existed in that era, and now in civilized society, we are rational, restrained, sober, and disdainful.

As the old magician said, ""People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.

On our path to success, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, we will not break our souls into pieces or make choices that are both beautiful and gloomy, right?

People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.",8

25 November 2006,Masterful Film-making,"I was fortunate that this movie was still playing at three theaters in my area this week. With junk like Santa Clause 3 and The Return in the theaters, I wanted something that looked truly stimulating.

I wasn't disappointed.

The Prestige is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. For starters, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Hugh Jackman perform magnificently, and will keep your eyes riveted to the screen. David Bowie was a nice surprise, and the recipient of a makeup job so convincing that my brother and I almost disbelieved it was he. Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are very convincing. Scarlett Johansson's performance is somewhat flat, but she makes up for it with sex appeal and flair.

Apart from the acting, the effects, sets, and ambiance of this film make for an excellent period piece. I was particularly enamored with the scenes in Colorado Springs. Simply spectacular.

I will reiterate the conclusions of the aforementioned writers. This movie is a magic trick unto itself, with the magnificent writing and twist of plot.

You too, won't be disappointed if you go to see it. Leave Santa Clause 3, Deja Vu, Bobby, Borat, and Flushed Away in the theaters. If you can get out to see The Prestige, it is well worth it.",10
29 August 2016,The illusion of perfect,"""The Prestige"" is a film that takes a middle hit it and makes it very unique, with a great script, complex, yet exciting and mysterious time, the film surprises at times, ""Look closer"" is a phrase which is repeated in the film sometimes seems that Nolan puts it in the script to speak directly to the viewer, ""look closer,"" that's what you need to do look more and close as the movie is full of subliminal tips what's the big trick, you need to pay attention and be surprised, moreover, it is worth noting the fine performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, as well as Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine, and even with a weak soundtrack and a dark picture, and costumes and simple screen elements, he convinces the film also touches on the subject of the obsession of the human being to be the best, no matter how expensive cost it, and in this respect Nolan is almost perfect, something lacking in the obsession of the characters , perhaps the fact that they are directly linked obsession with reason. In addition to showing the historical Tesla, we see a little about the world of illusions from the late eighteenth century, such a surreal way that now seem magical, talking about magic, it's cool as the film makes clear that the real magic is the science and that the obsessions are not worth the price of those we love. The film and good surprises the script and performances, but is otherwise common to conservative means too much for a movie about magic and illusionism.",8
19 November 2007,Predictable and Contrived,"There was very little to enjoy in this movie. The characters were so unsympathetic as to create apathy for what ever happens next. The plot was predictable; the twists were contrived and silly.

The movie itself, while very stylish and pretty to look at, felt forced. It lacks the smooth illusionist's quality that allows us to suspend disbelief and be deceived or dive in and accept the illusion. Instead it bumps along and tries to bully us into believing that we were just fooled.

The greatest success of the movie is the creation of the period. The costumes, sets and scenery do an excellent job of putting us in the setting. Visually, the movie is excellent.

Dr. Tesla's scientific solution is a horrible plot contrivance that turns a mediocre movie into a something worse. The result of the experiment fails to surprise or shock. The ""trick"" can be seen coming at us. Personally, I wanted be wrong and hoped there would be some final plot twist that would surprise and redeem this movie. There wasn't.

This movie fails to come together. As the film draws to a conclusion, it is very hard to care which character will win. Both are reprehensible enough that it is just too late to care what happens.

The Prestige is just frustrating to sit through for all the wrong reasons.",1
4 November 2006,A mesmerizing masterpiece,"From what I read about The Prestige in the paper, I was expecting an exciting, entertaining little movie from one of my favorite directors starring three of my favorite actors. So, rather casually, I drove up to a nearby theater with one of my friends to see it. I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, but I suspected I would at least enjoy the experience.

I can happily say it was the most pleasant surprise of my life. My mind was utterly blown by the dark, beautifully crafted masterpiece that seized control of my senses and not for a moment let go. The plot involves two magicians, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman), who were once partners but are flung down paths of revenge by a tragic event that may or may not have been an accident. From this relatively simple base, the movie spirals down into the abyss of obsession, competition, and plain hatred in a manner that will keep you guessing towards the end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give magnificent performances, aided by a strong supporting cast including Michael Caine and David Bowie(!) Nolan's brilliant directing and Jackman's masterful acting shed light on Angier's obsession that eventually consumes his live, as he desperately seeks to unravel the mystery enshrouding his rival's ultimate act, 'The Transported Man.' The answer to the enigma will drop your jaw and send a cold shiver down your spine. The twists and turns in the deliciously convoluted plot are quite natural, not at all like the cheap gimmickry abounding in the works of M. Night Shymalan.

Staged like an enormous magic trick, The Prestige keeps you guessing and, more importantly, questioning. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had seen for several days after I left the theater. The Prestige easily stands as one of the best movies of 2006. I sincerely hope it is given some serious consideration for some Oscars. In my mind, only Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' strikes me as a better movie.

24 July 2022,Are we following the action closely?,"Christopher Nolan's works are mostly unique and memorable. People are ready to revise his projects over and over again, and the works do not become outdated and remain relevant. Prestige is an excellent work of a director who competently confronts the characters with each other, wrapping this confrontation in the colorful world of Nikola Tesla's great discoveries.

Nolan's film is based on a fantasy drama by Christopher Priest, who released a book with the same title in 1995. Nolan's brother Jonathan significantly altered the story, turning it into a script, which the director turned into a colorful thriller. Nolan's vision is, as always, special. His statement is easy enough to guess. The viewer is in suspense from the first to the last frame, watching the development of the story with unprecedented interest.

The non-linearity of the narrative, which, by the way, is familiar to the author of the film, as always, first confuses the viewer and whips up interest, and then competently reveals the whole picture, leading to delight and even bewilderment closer to the finale of the picture.

The success of the film is also possible thanks to the excellent performance of the actors. The film is based not only on the undoubtedly talented and very convincing Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Their persuasiveness is complemented by maestro Michael Caine, memorable Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall. Together they build a whole world into which the viewer is immersed with interest.

Years may pass in the picture, but editing and competent narration present us with a full-fledged story, where there is no place for any obvious gaps or distortions. The story looks smooth and monotonous, literally not letting you get bored thanks to the mystery on the screen. After all, the viewer follows not only the confrontation between the heroes of Jackman and Bale, but also their incredible performances, which in themselves are whole performances for the audience.

The fierce struggle shows how magicians-illusionists over time lose their understanding of the limits of what is permissible, are ready to go to the end, even become immoral in order to achieve triumph and emerge victorious from this confrontation. Suddenly you catch yourself thinking that there are no heroes and villains here. Here, each of the magicians is ready to push to the end, not even looking at their families. For them, the main thing is victory.

The denouement is sure to make the viewer perplexed. After all, this is Nolan. He perfectly brings us to the final, escalating the situation and preparing an interesting twist. Especially since we are watching a movie about illusionists. ""Prestige"" will definitely make you think about how the viewer would act in the place of this or that hero, what he would be willing to sacrifice for the sake of defeating an opponent, whether such a victory is worth the effort expended and the subsequent shocks.

Christopher Nolan's film will be a great opportunity to enjoy a beautiful picture, a high-quality performance of famous actors, immerse yourself in an unusual plot and a time epoch. Chic costumes, an unforgettable atmosphere and of course the magic of magic tricks will appear before you. Such a film is definitely worth seeing in order to feel the whole story from beginning to end, and in the final to answer the question to yourself about what actions you are ready to do to achieve victory.

13 April 2007,"A masterpiece - and Morgan Shepard is in it, too!","This movie was a big surprise for me. I expected some kind of mystery thriller, but this movie was for more sophisticated as I thought it would be.

First of all is the complex way it is narrated, with a narrator at the beginning and the end, but mostly a visual presentation of a diary that also takes into account another diary read by the owner of the first diary - and the owner of the second diary reads the first diary in jail! That's not the usual sweet and simple Hollywood brain candy, and it's obvious at this point that the movie must be based on a clever novel. That's probably also were the script's meditations on the nature of show magic come from. The ending will be a big, big revelation, but all the loose strands come together in a very ironic climax.

Photography is good, if somewhat gloomy, fitting the plot, of course. But it's a wonderful break from the artificial and computer game like looking photography often found in Hollywood movies today.

Acting is great overall, that's all there is to say. David Bowie is wonderful as the somewhat sinister, faustian inventor Tesla. And, of course, I was so surprised when I saw Morgan Shepard in his small but wonderful part! He's a magnificent and distinguished actor who mostly gets small parts, which is quite a shame. He was also in Ridley Scott's Duellists or the Seaquest TV serial.

Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the score: while this bland and repetitive piece of music works OK in the movie (you don't hear much of it), it doesn't survive the light of day on a CD. That's no big surprise, though, when a score is ""produced"" by Hans Zimmer, that overrated wannabe score composer.",10

28 October 2006,The Ultimate Magic Trick,"""The Prestige"" is easily the best film in the last two years.

I've seen it twice so far and I enjoyed it more the second time around because many of the scenes that had seemed flawed the first time around are actually very important to the plot.

""The Prestige"" is a magic trick unto it's self. It actually has two twists and both are revealed in the first few minutes of the film and are continued to be revealed throughout; but still, we are surprised by the ending.

I don't want to give anything away, so just be sure to watch carefully. Then go back and see it again and if you pay very close attention, you will see that everything actually fits into place perfectly.

My pet peeve with Hollywood is that they spend $200 on special effects but don't bother with writing a decent script. The script for ""The Prestige"" was obviously thought out and re-thought until it was flawless. If you don't fully understand the ending, you can read some of the message boards on this website to have it explained.

After ""Momento,"" I had expected great things from Christopher Nolan. ""The Prestige"" is the film I had been waiting for.",10
5 November 2006,Casts a Magical Spell Even Over the Magic non-Fan,"After a slow start, during which I was tempted to walk out of the movie (but I did not, because I'd read positive reviews here), ""The Prestige"" did cast its spell over me.

""The Prestige"" is visually lush, with high production values. Ornate Victorian coaches, gleaming beaver-skin top hats, high and low rent theaters and slums are recreated in glorious, or inglorious, as appropriate, detail.

The actors are all fine. Scarlett Johansson did not annoy me as she usually does; the director got a real performance out of her, as well as got her to wear her usual revealing neckline. Hugh Jackman is well cast as a man with a charming surface and a dangerous, secret interior life. I've never seen Michael Caine more appealing. He's the older mentor character here, and he doesn't seem so much to be performing as just being.

Christian Bale is riveting as a young, scary, ambitious Cockney magician.

I wasn't crazy about David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. (His name *was* ""Nikola,"" not ""Nicholas."") I think of Bowie as a man who shocks, and he was uninteresting here. Tesla is an historical figure who lived a fascinating, controversial life, and I just didn't see much of that on screen. And Bowie's accent was all wrong; it was a big deal that Tesla was a Serb. Depicting him with a Dutch accent, as Bowie seemed to be doing, is kind of like depicting an African American historical figure as a WASP.

Andy Serkis, as Tesla's assistant, was one of the most fun things to watch in the whole movie. I kept thinking, as I was watching him, ""Who is that guy? Have I seen that guy before? Whoever he is, he is really fun to watch."" Dang if it wasn't Gollum, from LOTR.

The movie offers a few tidbits from the world of magic -- a cameo by famed NY stage magician and historian of magic, Ricky Jay; discussions of how various tricks were performed; magic lore. But this is never heavy handed, and though I'm bored by discussions of stage magic, these scenes didn't put me off.

The plot -- well, I can't say anything about the plot. Part of the reason for watching the movie is the pleasure of attempting to work out the puzzle as you watch the film.

The plot is a device to depict two men going at each other's throats, and losing their own souls by doing so. Ambition, Envy, Pride, Competition, Secretiveness, Obsession: lotsa big themes we can all relate to, whether we are Victorian magicians or not.

What was missing, for me, in this otherwise quite excellent movie, was any emotional depth.

A couple of examples.

In his early scenes, I had a hard time believing Hugh Jackman as a hungry young magician. He is in his late thirties, and he looks it.

His character is married to a much younger woman, who is blonde and pretty, and passive, as a doll. She's little more than fringe on the stage. I had a hard time believing their marriage. Given the importance, to the plot, of their union, this inability to invest in their marriage was almost fatal to my ability to invest in the movie.

A key female character's suicide rang false to me for a couple of reasons. This was a very likable character, and her suicide threw the movie terribly off. Her suicide was never reacted to with any appropriate depth. At that point, the movie really did seem like too much of a wind-up toy that existed only to serve its trick ending.

This is especially unfortunate, because a key line, ""I love you today,"" and its ultimate meaning, speaks volumes about the nature of love.

Poor Scarlett Johansson, who may never overcome the curse of her lush body and director's urges to exploit it, is made to fall in love a couple of times, and her only motivation for taking this monumental step is that she is given seconds-long scenes in which she looks into a man's eyes and -- SNAP! -- falls in love.

With just a little work and a few more lines of dialogue and action to fully animate its female characters, ""The Prestige"" could have been that most perfect of creations, a movie that entertains both men and women. For primarily male viewers, there is the clockwork plot and the cutthroat competition. For female viewers, there could have been fully realized characters, including fully realized female characters, inhabiting a film that has a heart as well as a crafty little head hiding schemes.

Instead, the only real warmth in the movie comes from Michael Caine, the wise old man whom directors love in a way that they could never love disposable young female beauties like Scarlett Johansson, and a movie that this viewer could very much like, but never love.",7

This film is on another level of incredible, everything is almost perfect in every way. From the storyline, to the actors, to the acting, to the journey you are taken on, this is a film I have seen almost a dozen times already and it won't stop there! At the time of release it was most certainly underplayed. This film will have people talking about their own interpretation of it and over the years I've read a lot of opinions. I'm pretty sure I've got the whole plot and specifics down to a tee, however, I won't be letting on to any spoilers on here!

20 November 2006,Excellent psychological/sci-fi thriller,"'The Prestige' is a classy thriller that appeals to an intelligent audience and is effortlessly one of the best films of the year. Set against the backdrop of a very authentic Victorian London, the film sees two magicians, rich toff Robert Angier and working class Alfred Borden, determined to make their mark in their expertise of thrilling their audiences. But their friendly rivalry descends into bitter, obsessive feud when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife and relations between them sour to a life-threatening extent.

The acting in this film is exemplary but then you expect no better considering the actors involved. Christian Bale plays the cool, reserved Borden who maintains his control in contrast to Hugh Jackman's the volatile Angier, a man whose hatred has turned him from suave to almost unhinged in his fanatical need to trump his rival. Michael Caine brings a calm, maturity to the film as Angier's loyal friend Cutter while relative newcomer Rebecca Hall gives an affecting performance as Borden's loving but increasingly bewildered wife.

The setting of 'The Prestige' has clearly been put together with love. Victorian London is flawless in depiction, giving the eerie atmosphere of the darker era where there was a sharp divide between rich and poor, the working class were relegated to slums and jails were hellish. The costumes were wonderful in design, especially some of Angier's suits which do well in enhancing Jackman's aristocratic role.

The actual plot is filled to the brim with twists and turns that should satisfy any mystery-lover. Sci-fi fans may piece the puzzle together quicker than those left hanging until the end but this should not put anyone off since what really makes the story is the interplay between Borden and Angier. The animosity-- largely kindled by grief, guilt and masculine arrogance-- is fascinating to see how far two men, who could have had successful lives were there not this feud, go in their pursuit to 'beat' the other. Caine's character Cutter offers nice input in showing how far can one man stand back and watch it all happen before he is forced to intervene. There is also a very interesting ethical debate raised, that I won't reveal in deference to those who haven't watched the film.

This masterpiece is highly recommended to those bored of conventional, run-of-the-mill blockbusters and want something deeper for a change.",9
27 August 2020,The prestige,"Cuttle has said not to use a double that he can't control, that he can only kill one at a time if he wants perfect control, and he has also said he wants to swap places with the double, so the double dies and he appears to enjoy the cheer.

Copying machines is also a scam from start to finish. Why is tesla leaving when the machine succeeds? Because he knew it couldn't be. Two magicians have been trying to atone for their hatred, just like magic deceiving the eyes, one keeps killing for it, and the other is schizophrenic for it.

So they all ended up dead.

17 January 2010,No Hell March,"I haven't read the novel; for a brief and concise list of differences, see the FAQ(and it contains spoilers, obviously; this review doesn't). The Nolans strike again with their very favorite subject; obsession. I won't make a crack about how they can't let that go. This and its ad campaign asks you to ""watch closely"", and frankly, it's because of me doing that that I figured out nearly every major twist. I'm not bragging; I honestly wish that there had been more surprises left. No, I'm warning you to not try to figure the secrets of this out before they are revealed to you, or at least not too hard. I also do agree with Ebert's complaint that they cheated in this. With that said, this is engaging, interesting and compelling from start to finish. The plot is marvelous, and this is well-paced. This is psychologically deep and accurate. The acting is amazing. This has a non-linear time-line, and utilizes it well. The story is fairly complicated, and you do need to pay attention. Script and dialog are well-written. This has fun moments, and the tone isn't all dark. Johansson looks incredibly hot as usual, and this does have some(albeit well-integrated and natural-seeming) eye-candy for males. There is a bit of bloody violence, a little mild to moderate language and plenty of disturbing content in this. The DVD contains a handful of short, informative featurettes, four photo galleries and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director or anyone else who helped put this together. 10/10",10
15 March 2021,Loved It!,"When you get Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Michael Caine and Andy Serkis in one film, how can it not be great. It's an amazing cast! As well as a great cast, this film has a really interesting story. The back and forth between Jackman and Bale is really good, with each one hating the other and trying to prove themselves more skilled.

My one complaint is the twist ending, is it really a twist? I suppose it is. I did see it coming from the moment we saw the hats and while it is good in terms of the story, it is very obvious. If you like Nolan you'll love this film, and even if you don't like Nolan this film is definitely worth a watch.

28 February 2007,The magic is in not knowing,"The Prestige is for my money, one of the best films on the subject of magic. Christopher Nolan has created a film that, like his earlier film Memento, plays on audience perception. The film is even presented like a magic trick. In magic there is the pledge in which the audience is shown something ordinary. At the start of the film we are shown a trick gone wrong as Hugh Jackman dies, drowning in a glass cage. The turn is where the magician performs the trick. For this film, the turn is the bulk of the storyline as we bounce back and forth through time following Angiers (Jackman) and fellow magician Borden (Christian Bale) as they study and master magic tricks. A tragic accident causes Angiers wife to die and a rivalry to grow between the two magicians. We watch as Angiers grows increasingly obsessed in his search for the secrets of Borden's tricks. Borden in the present tense of the story is on trial and sentenced to hang for Angiers death. Mixing these events, Nolan tantalizes the audience with many sleights of hand which will leave you guessing. It is only the end, or the prestige of the trick that all is revealed and we see how this story has truly played out. While I won't give up the twist, it is a very fun twist that does nothing to dampen the rest of the film. The Prestige is dark to be sure but there have been darker films over the years. Kudos go to Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale for standout performances and to Nolan for a superb script and nuanced direction. Give this one a go.",9

17 December 2008,Let's watch middle-aged men talk for 2 hours! That sounds SO fun!,"There is something Quentin Tarantino always says that I couldn't help apply to The Prestige. In a lot of interviews, he mentioned that most movies anymore aren't even stories, but rather a single circumstance that the director just lives up to for two hours. And that's exactly the problem The Prestige and every other Nolan film has. Nolan just takes one boring concept, then attempts to stretch it out into a long-winded, boring movie by use of his watered-down metafiction directing style. If The Prestige would have been the idea of any other director, they would have at least added SOMETHING to the one-track story or cut it down to half the time so it would have at least been slightly less tedious to sit though.

The Prestige opens up with the single least interesting first hour I've ever witnessed in a film. Is there anything whatsoever that was even remotely meant to hold my attention? From the severely uninteresting opening, the movie tries hard to redeem itself with a middle ""twist"" that is too shallow to be called a true plot twist. Simply put, it's a weird sci-fi insert and nothing more. I have nothing against that, but one semi-interesting plot point can't save a pointless movie from being pointless. By the predictable ending, all the scenes that made no sense before make sense. I assume this is a style Nolan finds clever, but it got old after Memento. In The Prestige it's simply annoying, if not a bit childish. It's used here as a way to force an uninteresting plot into something that is watchable by indulging the viewer in cliché mystery. And I predictable and analyzed everything I just said above in the first ten minutes alone. Ironic, isn't it, that Nolan tries so hard to unpredictable but the very storytelling method he uses gives himself away. Christopher Nolan is a lot like an immature little kid trying to impress an old magician with a cheap coin trick. It's amusing and cute at most.

The other main problem with The Prestige is it lacks anything whatsoever even slightly original. The one-line plottwo dueling magicianshas been used in everything from multiple CSI episodes to cartoons like Scooby Doo to old classic horror Hitchcock Presents episodes. The sci-fi insertI won't spoil what it ishas been done before in other movies time and time again. The dramatic scenes are all as cliché and predictable as possible. All the fanboys who are calling The Prestige even remotely original really make me laugh.

The acting is decent on all fronts, and sometimes borders on cheesy when some of the actors forget their accents half-way through. The directing is somewhat stylish, but nothing that held my attention or is anywhere above average.

But above all, the main flaw is by far the fact that 2/3rds of the entire movie is irrelevant to the plot or to anything whatsoever. It's just a bunch of old men repeating the same lines about magic tricks over and over to the point of nausea. I don't have the strongest attention span, but I can certainly sit through a slow-paced movie when the slow pacing actually has something to do with the story. For example, the original 1970s Alien had a complete hour of seemingly irrelevant screen time, but it used that to build atmosphere. Here, in The Prestige, you have an hour and a half of screen time devoted to nothing but hearing old men talk about things that make no difference. It doesn't build atmosphere; it bores. I was already screaming, ""Does it EVER end?"" at the screen before I was even halfway through, and that is simply ridicules.

Overall, The Prestige is a completely pointless watch because you've seen it all beforein half the time. It's cliché, painfully boring, and ultimately pointless: all staples of Christopher Nolan's film making.

While having only a few films under his belt (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia), trust Christopher Nolan to produce, write and direct films only of this extraordinary depth and caliber.

Another thing to clue you in on how marvelous The Prestige is: the exceptional cast. Premiere cult actor Christian Bale (also of Batman Begins, American Psycho) convincingly switches from ruthless to charming as the richly layered magician Borden that rivals multi-talented Hugh Jackman's suave but obsessive Angier. Michael Caine as their subtly complex assistant, David Bowie as the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla and Rebecca Hall as Borden's quietly suffering wife all add to the tension, mystery and suspension of disbelief that make The Prestige such a success. Scarlett Johanssen is the only one who unfortunately becomes just the cherry that tops all the eye candy, but her screen presence is unquestionable.

This is Nolan's best piece to date: his film-making resonates the magical theme, the dark, moody textures of the period, and the fragmented storytelling. He mirrors the obsessive, fiercely competitive magicians on screen, by showcasing his expertise in using flashbacks and foreshadowing; each framed element carefully placed, everything connecting to the beautifully poignant end.

The Prestige hooks you in from the very first scene of the mysterious mountain of top hats; you allow its stunning imagery, characters and storyline to seduce you into its enigmatic world and leave you enthralled but aching for more when the credits roll and the evocatively appropriate soundtrack ""Analyse"" by Radiohead's Thom Yorke stays with you long after your cinematic experience. Nolan's slick sleight-of-hand demo proves that commercial efforts need not be blithe, campy or depressing to also be critically acclaimed.",10
3 August 2022,"""Are you watching closely?""","Christopher Nolan follows up the great Batman Begins with an excellent psychological, thriller, drama.

Not one of Christopher Nolan's original scripts but rather based on a Novel by Christopher Priest. Though the Nolan brothers Johnathan and Christopher adapt the novel into a screenplay and they do it in spectacular fashion. I've never read the book but if the book is as good as the film then they did a great job.

Nolan teams up once more with the acting talents of Christian Bale and Michael Caine and both did great just as they did in Batman Begins. Alongside the two great actors is Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. Hugh Jackman shines opposite to Christian Bale, though I feel the weakest in this film is Johansson. While she is a great actress her attempt at a British accent is not the best and the subplot with her never captured me. These are probably nitpicks in what is an overall strong film.

Great cinematography, great writing, and a great score makes The Prestige one of Nolan's best films.

15 December 2020,"That's bloody marvellous, Cutter!","Marvellous it is. I love this film. I've seen it a crazy number of times - maybe approaching 25 times. It's now on Netflix and so yes, on it comes. Again! And I'm thinking I'll just watch 10-20 mins, but I watch the entire thing again.

For me, it's best Nolan film. Absolutely. No doubt. If you watch it. Watch it again! Please. No matter what your get out of it first time, you will always get more from this film. It's the trick that keeps giving.

Enjoy.

11 December 2020,"One of the top Nolan films and one of the very best and remarkable films ever made! Two men, one vendetta, The Prestige.","Historical / thriller / fantasy film. It takes us back to the 19th century, to another era, where two young magicians are in their infancy. A fatal mistake of one in the other's wife, starts an eternal vendetta, something beyond than just competition. As the plot unfolds, the original incentive of the vendetta has been forgotten, there is only rivalry now, with no return. It also introduces us a vendetta behind the vendetta. So, apart from the vendetta of the two magicians, there is also the well-known Tesla-Edison vendetta and there the film gives some science fiction with a fiction Tesla device. A modest film, an extremely well-written script with 4 big twists, of which the 2 huge twists come one after the other at the end of the film, with excellent direction, great scenery and very good acting by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson, one of the top Nolan films and one of the very best and remarkable films in general. Two men, one vendetta, The Prestige.

15 November 2014,MY MOVIES: Nolan's Magic!!,"The Prestige. Every magic trick has three parts. The pledge where you show something ordinary, The Turn where you make that ordinary thing disappear and The Prestige where you make that thing appear again. Without The Prestige, a magic trick is worthless. On the same line, Nolan's magical movie works. He starts you showing few ordinary humanly characters, surprises you with its twists and turns of the story and then leave you speechless and awed at the end.

Centred around the professional and personal rivalry of two magicians played by charismatic Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, The Prestige is a genius work of Christopher Nolan. With its non-linear story telling, he keeps you glued to the show of magic and life of magicians. With is period setting, great visuals, delicious dialogs and top notch performances by its lead and supporting actors like Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, Nolan creates a feast of cinematic magic.

There are hardly any loose ends and revelations at the end, even if you saw them coming much earlier are great enough to leave you impressed. What also works in favour, that it is a mind bender and you might like to revisit to enjoy it more and more.

I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for The Prestige. As it is said in the movie, people love to be fooled in this otherwise simple world, The Prestige is nothing less than a great magic trick played in front of you leaving you smiling and clapping at the end.",9

Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations.

6 May 2007,"Well made but off-puttingly complicated at times, especially towards the end","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

London, the turn of the Century. Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.

Director Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.

Well, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.

The title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.

A good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***",7
13 October 2011,Packed with more plot than you can imagine.,"If you think this film is mediocre or just a ""period piece"" then you have to think again because the true depth of this plot cannot be realized without watching repeatedly.

I have watched it through several times and still can't tell if the Michael Caine character was the true mastermind.

This screenplay could play in any time or place, even with unknown actors, and still generate eternal wonder.

Too many directors rely on gratuitous violence, expensive action sequences, big name actors and grandiose sets/CGI to wow the viewers Christopher Nolan is an unmitigated genius and doesn't need any of those tricks.

7 March 2008,There is Beauty in Misdirection,"It is rare for Hollywood movies to engross a real adult in a film, but this one succeeds. Certainly there are magic tricks, but magic is really just the gimmick that allows this fascinating tale of an all-consuming competition for stage dominance between two master magicians to unfold.

And there's more magic behind the individual amazing performances. Not only do the actors convince the audience of their sincerity in the performance of their role, but nearly every one is performing their role in a foreign accent. Hugh Jackman is Australian putting on a fine American sound. Christian Bale is Welsh providing an impressive London street sound.

There will be a need to see the film a second time, to see how cleverly the screenplay was written. Beautiful work. The overall effect is that you are watching a mystery, romance, suspense movie all at once. Great costumes, beautiful look and feel to the piece. Fabulous acting.

28 September 2017,"The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful","Rewatching this makes it pretty clear what Nolan's primary focus is in storytelling (if it wasn't obvious before) - perspective and the subjective nature of it. What better way to expound on that than in a story about dueling magicians hiding their secrets from one another.

There are metaphors galore in this (how could there not be in a film about subjectivity and obsession) but it struck me this time how convenient the story is. It moves constantly and forcefully forward, revealing twists all the way, daring you to try and outguess it, so at first it's easy to miss on the plot contrivances and somewhat simple nature of it all. But I'm also not sure how much that matters. The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful.

18 April 2007,It absolutely blew my mind.,"The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.

I did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.

The opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician ""Cutter"", are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the ""secrets"" to some of the tricks are revealed.

The second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.

A rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.

That, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.

Robert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather ""true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.

Hugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.

Christian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.

The entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll.",10

22 October 2006,The Prestige:You'll be talking about it long after it's gone.,"The Prestige - Christopher Nolan's latest collaboration with Christian Bale in which magicians in turn-of-the-century London who battle each other for trade secrets. The rivalry is so intense that it turns them into murderers. Hugh Jackman plays level-headed showman Rupert Angier to Bale's unpredictable but brilliant magician Alfred Borden.

The performances are very good all around. I caught Scarlett Johanessan's fake British accent slip same as Natalie Portman's (V for Vendetta) once or twice. They must've had the same voice coach. Bale is sinister, seemingly omnipresent and omniscient, and usually the most watchable character on screen, though Hugh Jackman makes for excellent competition as a man getting down and dirty as he gives up all in a bid to be the best magician. Michael Caine is charming and talented support as always. I didn't even recognize David Bowie as Nikola Tesla; he was almost the real Prestige (unveiling of third act in a magic trick) of the film The tricks, while not as fantastic visually as in The Illusionist, are much more realistic and there is more of a desire to see them unveiled. The cinematography and scripting are top-notch, and the film has the wonderful dis-jointed yet well-paced quality that has come to be a trademark of Christopher Nolan. The film has some genuine suspense to it, and I can't tell anymore about the plot than this, but nothing and no -one is what it seems. The entire film is a magic trick, and the denouement is infinitely more satisfying, weighty and horrifying than that of The Illusionist. For a film titled after the shocking climax of a magic trick, this ending does not disappoint. The only question is whether the film is worth more than one watching. It also was a bit long, though I'm damned if I could figure out what to leave from it. Still, it'll undoubtedly be in my top ten of this year, so I'll give The Prestige an A.",9
24 April 2007,The Prestige vs The Illusionist,"Although both movies have certain similarities, Victorian, magicians, beautiful people, twist endings, there is one huge difference, ""The Illusionist"" is enjoyable while ""The Prestige"" is a pretentious, manipulated, confusing, mess. The character development is especially weak, the accents barely intelligible, and the time jumps annoying. If the movie had played out in an orderly fashion, it might have proved more enjoyable. I cannot recommend ""The Prestige"". If you must see a magical movie, and enjoy being manipulated toward a twist ending, then ""The Illusionist"" is your movie. At least it makes a little bit of sense. Rate ""The Illusionist"" 7.0, ""The Prestige"" 3.0 - MERK

10 April 2007,Nolan's real follow-up to Memento,"After his brilliant breakout film Memento, director Chris Nolan went on to create the forgettable Insomnia and the overrated Batman Begins. The third outing to come (The Prestige), however, is his real follow-up to Memento, in my own honest little opinion, both in quality as well as in depth.

This moody and complex film is a real treat for cinephiles wherever they are. Describing a fatal rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two competing magicians in 19th century London, it capitalizes largely on the length some people will go just to get even with their professional opponents. While the magic displayed on screen is what catches your eye at first, it is the swirl of emotions our two lead characters go through that makes this a true delight. Spanning over numerous years, we see Angier and Borden going from great career and personal heights to the lowest bottoms in their pursuit of the one true magic trick that'll make people remember them for years to come.

To top this all up, the movie itself acts as the ultimate magic trick, with its various acts working as the required steps that allow us to fully enjoy and realize the final twist for all its brilliance and originality.",9

8 March 2017,In My Top Five Films Of All-Time,"Whenever I am given the near-impossible task of ""listing my top five films of all-time"", one thing has held the test of time: since I first watched ""The Prestige"", it has been firmly ensconced on that list.

For a basic plot summary, ""The Prestige"" sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness. When a tragedy befalls their friendship and they grow apart, an obsession with perfecting the ""Disappearing Man"" trick drives both of them to lengths most magicians would not be willing to aspire to.

This film is an all-time great primarily because of its tremendous plot. I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject--magic--from which to tell this incredible story. It will keep you guessing until the very end...and then even further as you continue to try and piece together the significance of every scene or character interaction. This film isn't as literally complicated as, say, Nolan's earlier effort ""Memento"", but in terms of overall punch and drama it is easily that flick's equal (if not outright superior).

The acting is also superb, with Bale & Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabu, & Rebecca Hall solidifying the auxiliary players. The slightest of glance or emotion can speak volumes in a film such as this, which features misdirection as one of its core tenants, and all the actors are wonderful at conveying that.

Basically, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that simply needs to be watched by all. It has the perfect ""hook"" in the magic-themed plot, and uses that metaphor as part of the overall storytelling device. Magic is all about obfuscation and sometimes outright deception, which are the main traits that Nolan uses here to craft an intriguing, engaging story and characters. Plus, as sort of an ""added bonus"", the film can be watched even as strictly a period piece (turn of the 19th century) and enjoyed thoroughly on that basis alone. Somehow, some way, you will find yourself completely caught up in the grandeur of ""The Prestige"".",10
23 October 2006,"Prestige a fun, well made, dark film.","If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before ""The Prestige"" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, ""Oh wow, this is getting boring,"" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie.

Magicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the best of friends until Borden accidentally kills Angier's wife during a magic show. They part ways, but Angier is suddenly obsessed with taking revenge on Borden. He sabotages one of Borden's shows and ends up wounding him. Now Borden wants revenge. What follows is a series of one-upmanship between the two rivals.

Jackman and Bale are brilliant as always, showing the madness of these characters and their need for revenge. Michael Caine plays a mentor-like character named Cutter with a strong cockney accent, and does amazing. The other actors; Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie, are all noteworthy holding their own against the great acting chops of Jackman, Bale, and Caine. One thing that confused me though, it is never really explained why they go to such lengths to hurt the other, when it was an accident to begin with. This was explained in the book, but not in the film. Everything else though was masterfully crafted, and well explained. The cinematography, the somewhat grainy look, the dark and sometimes humorous approach of the film are all trademarks of Chris Nolan. He showed he could direct with ""Batman Begins"" which also starred Bale and Caine- and he has shown it again with ""The Prestige"". It is a fun film, with plenty of twists and turns, and is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Oh, and if you didn't catch my drift before, read the book as well. I give ""The Prestige"" 9 out of 10. It is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.",9

7 January 2007,Simply magic!!!,"Could it have been better? No. Not in my opinion. This film will take you on a magical journey through the behind-the-scenes of magic. Throughout that journey it is secretly building up to something that will make you shiver, make your jaw drop, but most of all make you absolutely love this movie. There's no stage where you find yourself wondering can I continue to sit through this, even at 130 minutes. Every scene, every line, every last word is acted out perfectly. I'm not sure whether it was the brilliant acting or simply the gripping, intriguing storyline itself which made this film so enjoyable throughout and not just when the twist is eventually revealed. Possibly it was both.

But needless to say from my point of view this is an obvious must-see. Some people complain that movies with twist endings are often boring for 95% of the movie, and possibly they're right. But that's what makes it so good that these types of movies are taking a step in the right direction and will hopefully only get better as time goes on.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

5 May 2007,One in a Million.,"There are occasions, when you know, you have seen something amazing. Something you don't see quite often. In movies, Prestige is definitely that something.

I left the cinema with the feeling that I have seen an amazing movie, comparison to which I can hardly find. There were some good movies that came out recently, but Prestige is truly one in a million.

Prestige belongs to the mystic genre of movies. It's mystic not only because there's a mysticism, but also because of the indirect narrator's style. It belongs with movies such as : Sixth Sense, The Butterfly Effect, Donny Darko, The I inside, Angel Heart, The jacket etc ... . Can't say it's the best in the category, but I definitely enjoyed it more than anything I listed.

The ending twist point was already done before ( Snapdragon, Les Rivières pourpres ). But as Michael Caine's character stated : You have got to know how to sell the trick. The outstanding way this twist point was sold to us, the viewers, makes the whole movie original.

The interesting plot and the perfect performance make this movie enjoyable, and unforgettable. I'm definitely going to buy this movie on DVD to watch again with my friends and family.

Just watch it!!!!!!!!!",10
26 January 2021,More than just clever,"A combination of John McTiernan, Brian DePalma, and Stanley Kubrick with Christopher Nolan's signature brand of non-linear storytelling, The Prestige is a tale of obsession, narrative storytelling, and trickery. Having the advantage of over a decade and several viewings, I feel bad for those tasked with the assignment to write about this film upon its initial release. This is a very clever movie, and it can be hard to discern, on an initial viewing, if there's more than the cleverness so clearly on display. I would say that yes, very firmly there is more than just the trickery.

It is the story of two magicians, Robert Angier (professionally known as The Great Danton, played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (""The Professor"", played by Christian Bale) who grow to hate each other, mostly Angier hating Borden. As young magicians, plants in the audience for a safely successful stage magician (played by the great magician Ricky Jay), Borden attempted a knot around Angier's wife's hands in a trick where she escapes from a water tank. The knot held too tightly, she couldn't escape, and she died. Angier cannot move on after the death of his wife while Borden tries to push his guilt behind him and lead his own life.

The rivalry that develops between Angier and Borden dallies between the professional and the personal for years as they try to sabotage each other's acts to become the greatest magician in London. Angier shoots off two of Borden's fingers in a bullet catch trick gone wrong. Borden damages one of Angier's apparatus that breaks a lady's fingers during a show. Borden comes out with a new trick, The Transported Man, that is so real that Angier, who watches in disguise, is utterly convinced that Borden's method cannot be a simple explanation, using a double. Following a set of clues, Angier ends up in Colorado trying to get an audience with Nikola Tesla, the famed inventor, and to get him to build the machine that Angier is convinced Tesla built for Borden.

As I wrote earlier, this movie is exceedingly clever. It sets up a lot of elements that all end up playing their parts in the film's third act. From Tesla's machine, to Borden's mysterious ingénieur Fallon, to even the very specific ways that Bale plays certain scenes, everything acts as a cog to the mysterious machine that Nolan has adapted from the Christopher Priest novel. Being a Christopher Nolan film, it's almost needless to say that these pieces come together really well by the end (one of the sources of trust that I have for the logic of Tenet working), but just being a clever machine is of limited value (one of the sources of my more muted reaction to Tenet).

Nolan provides that through his two main characters, but they're a surprisingly difficult pair. Obsession is not an endearing quality we like to see in the people we know, and watching these two men cast aside the remnants of their personal connections or frustratingly deal with those still in their lives can be a hard watch. Since this is part of the emotional core of the film, that presents a certain challenge to the audience. Now, I have no problem with that in general, but there's a certain element of seemingly expected emotional connection when both men are supposed to be protagonists, and Borden himself seems so inconsistent. This is one advantage that Nolan has in his intricate, ""need to see it again"", approach to storytelling. Borden's seemingly erratic behavior comes into greater focus, but repeat viewings end up turning into a bit of a guessing game as you try to figure out which side of Borden is in which scene. There's one side of Borden that deserves the most sympathy who would have probably been the protagonist in a more straight-forward telling of the story.

I'm not sure it's the difficultness of the characters that really bothers me, but their opaqueness. There's an intentional effort to keep the audience from getting to know them, especially Borden, in favor of the mystery they're surrounded by. I consider a particular side of Borden to be the emotional core of the film (as evidenced by the movie's final images with his daughter), so that Borden's nature is also part of the mystery undermines some of the finale's emotional impact.

Now, having said that, the movie's far from emotionally dead. The emotional impact of Borden's end could have been stronger, but it still ends up strong enough to work. Nolan's approach to the material focuses elsewhere, and that's on the story's underlying questions on storytelling. The idea that audiences know that what they're seeing is all fake, but if you can fool them, even only for a second, then you've given them what they want. That all this is for the looks on the audience's faces (ironic since most of the faces will be hidden from Nolan as opposed to the live audience for the illusionists). What he's self-consciously doing, and laying out by the end, is that for all the artifice around the story, there's still a core promise between the artist and the audience. For all the trickery in the world, the artist still needs to bring the story back around to a human element, to make that which disappeared inexplicably reappear. This is where Borden's story that works well enough really has its impact and where I wish it had a bit more, but I'm not sure how Nolan might have reorganized this story to clarify Borden while also maintaining the elaborate mystery that drives the central point.

So, I do kind of love this movie. It's really well made. Hugh Jackman is very good as Angier, and Christian Bale is solid as Borden along with a very good supporting cast, in particular Rebecca Hall as Borden's long-suffering wife Sarah, Michael Caine as Angier's ingénieur, and David Bowie as the enigmatic but composed Tesla. The story is obviously a twisting adventure that uses point of view stringently and jumping timelines with confidence and skill. I just have this wish that the emotional punch of the movie's final moments was stronger.",8
15 April 2008,Superb exploration of its subject matter,"I've just watched The Prestige and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I've always had a fascination for stage and street magic - not so much to ""figure out the tricks"", but with an appreciation of the combination, of stagecraft, misdirection, and sleight of hand. The great magicians aren't remembered for ""clever tricks"" - rather, for the overall entertainment, for the illusion.

And this film is perfect for all that. There is a mystery to it (in fact, at least two mysteries), but the clues to each are telegraphed all throughout the film, in plain sight. You have to watch and be alert.

I figured out one of the mysteries in the middle of the film, but was still fascinated by how it was done. I think this is the same thrill I get when I'm watching a film about con artists (or a good episode of the old Mission Impossible), because what is shown is not always what is.

And as this film explains, it's not how such things are done that matters (because once it's explained, no one cares any more), rather, it's that creation of illusion so that we have ""mystery"", that does.",10
12 January 2021,Nolan's Magic Trick,"Overall, The Prestige is a mind-boggling but special film. Christopher Nolan performs his own magic on the audience by consuming us in a world that is filled with twists and turns at every corner. Everything about the film is genius in my view, although it will take multiple viewings to fully understand the point of the film. However, when I understood what had happened, I has amazed. The performances, music, writing is superb, and this is a very underrated film that is not talked about in the way other Nolan films are. This is a great film that every film lover should see, go treat yourself!

15 October 2006,An illusion of a magic thriller.,"The Prestige begins as does The Illusionist (2006): Magic tricks in the 19th century that astound the audience in the film and in front of it. The difference is that Prestige offers the secrets of many tricks where Illusionist bares few if any. Perhaps that difference reveals a figurative distance between the similar films: Prestige keeps an emotional distance, as do its characters, while Illusionist is very much about love between a man and a woman with the illusions serving that love. Indeed, ""prestige"" from the Middle French means illusion and tricks.

The Prestige tells of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), rivals for a lifetime. Their intense competition centers around being the best magician in London, a feat mostly connected with Borden's electromagnetic transporting a man in a split second to somewhere else. Angier wants the secret, and that's no secret in the film, nor that both men share the affection of Angier's assistant, played by the increasingly curvaceous Scarlett Johansson.

The convolutions of plot are no surprise coming from Christopher Nolan of Memento fame. The downside is that the plot becomes repetitious, especially as it circles the doppelganger motif. Truth and illusion are served well, many times over, until redundancy and boredom set in, certainly for this reviewer who usually loves ambiguity and paradox.

A ""prestige"" is the final stage of a trick, the one that brings back whatever had vanished and asserts the magician's preeminence. This film did not bring back for me the terror of the trick as Illusionist did. The trick is probably that Prestige looks like The Illusionist but is an illusion of just such a magic thriller.",

29 May 2017,The importance of secrecy. Never think that spies are the best!,"A historical story line which demands a lot of attention to detail and art. Selection of the best in the class cast. Fantasy with realistic touch with scientists as characters. Salute you .. director. you did it well.

I have a different view point for a certain point. I believe to keep the essence of the story 'importance of keeping secrets', you could have taken another mystical point to conclude the story. Like the live characters do not able to find out the secrecy even at the climax. May be for a commercial success of the movie, after that point, you could have indicated some points to the audience. Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then. But I believe, a person who sacrificed friendship & love (and many others..I cannot be a spoiler here!) will not do this at certain point to prove something to person who is no longer important to him.

22 December 2006,Oh what a tangled web...,"When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?

9 January 2007,"A deceptive, spellbinding piece of supreme film-making","""Are you watching closely?"". This question is repeated several times in Christopher Nolan's fifth feature, a complex, compelling opus that sees him return to Mementoish territory.

Set in Victorian London, The Prestige deals with magic, although not the kind we're used to: what we see is a much darker side of this fascinating profession, which might even be lethal to some people. In fact, death is present from the beginning: right after Michael Caine's opening monologue about the three acts every magic trick is divided in (the third act gives the film its title) we witness a tragedy, as the famous Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), aka The Great Danton, drowns during his last performance. His colleague and former friend Alfred ""The Professor"" Borden (Christian Bale) is accused of murdering the showman, and as he's sent to jail the events that led to that fatal night are told in a series of interconnected flashbacks: the two used to work together, under the guidance of the experienced Cutter (Caine), and were quite good friends, until a terrible tragedy put an end to that comradeship. As the years pass, the rivalry between them gets more and more dangerous, the two using their different qualities (Borden has better tricks, Angier more charisma) to become the best magician in Europe, in a conflict so devastating it might destroy everything they have.

It's not just the audacious storytelling that makes The Prestige similar to Memento. The two films also share the key theme: obsession. Leonard Shelby, the disturbed protagonist of Memento, insisted on tracking down the man who killed his wife, even though he knew he probably wouldn't succeed because of his inability to form new memories. The same thing happens to Angier and Borden: they're so obsessed with winning the duel they don't even care about the people surrounding them or what actually made them enemies in the first place. Around these layered, mysterious and intriguing characters Nolan constructs a riveting picture with stunning attention to detail: like his protagonists, the director fools the audience while laying out the clues that will lead to the shocking final revelation, a mind-blowing climax which adds poignancy to Cutter's instantly memorable line ""You want to be fooled..."".

In his intent, Nolan is impeccably helped by his cast, each of the actors, including Scarlett Johansson as both magicians'assistant/mistress and David Bowie as the eccentric scientist Nikola Tesla, adding shades of darkness and ambiguity. Bale and Caine, working with the director for the second consecutive time, are superb, playing interesting variations of their Batman Begins roles (tormented, lonely leading man and wise, caring mentor/father figure respectively) and raising expectations for said movie's sequel, and Jackman is easily their match, successfully developing the emotional maturity he began to show in X2 and delivering his finest performance to date. The real star, however, remains Nolan, who consistently pulls the right strings in the right moment, thus ensuring The Prestige is one of the absolutely best films of 2006, not to mention (possibly) his best achievement so far.",10
1 January 2007,"Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception...","1st watched 1/1/2007 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Christopher Nolan): Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception put together by a Director who appears to be becoming a master in this field, which he started in his first movie, Memento. Christopher Nolan starts off with a simple story of a man accused of the murder of another man. They both happen to be in the same field of magic and we're major competitors in this arena. We then are taken backwards to the events that led up to this supposed murder. This is where the movie becomes extremely complex and is driven by the wonderful subtle performances of everyone involved. This is one of those movies where you don't want to miss any points of dialogue because you're afraid you'll miss out on something important, and with Nolan, you will be. He is able to sustain a mostly dialogue-driven movie for over two hours and your mind is still racing as the final credits roll. The magicians', played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale, personal battles are the major focus which started when Jackman's character's wife is killed during a failed magic trick where he blames Bale's character. But also entering unto the scene is the idea of performing the ultimate illusion by possible using ""real magic"", which in this case is electricity re-directed to transpose a person from one place to another. This is being tested by a man named Tesla, played wonderfully by the rock star/actor David Bowie, as the government & Thomas Edison vehemently tries to pull the plug & funding to shutdown the experiments. This subplot was a personal revelation to me because of a song by a group coincidentally called Tesla, called ""Edison's medicine"", which suggests trickery & under-handed things being done so he could gain the rights to electricity. Anyway, back to the movie--- All of these elements are blended together so well that the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10 is because of the confusion at the end(wish was actually part of the fun of the movie, but could be distracting to some). It would amaze me if a better movie was made in 2006, but it probably won't win the Oscar because it's too thought-provoking, which is too bad. I will be anxiously awaiting another Christopher Nolan movie though, as I'm sure many other people are as well.",9
8 June 2007,"good, but slightly over-rated","By now we know that the unexpected would be for Christopher Nolan to make an expected film. Yet, 'The Prestige' is to some extend the most expected film of Nolan until now. It is an adaptation of a novel about the rivalry between two magicians turned into a life long obsessive fight, and although we do find interesting issues like the relationship between perception and reality and the border between life and illusion for an artist, the overall script is too much conventional in structure. The most disappointing is the ending, sure, we get an explanation for much of what we have seen, and the explanation makes sense, but then the magic is gone. You do not explain magic and expect for magic to stay.

On the good side we have a strong hate story, which stays in the memory on the memorable stories of rivalry brought to screen, in the line of the 'Count of Monte Christo'. The script is well written, with some memorable lines. We also have Michael Caine whose every new act seems now to radiate personal charisma and the joy to be with us and act for us. Please Mr. Caine, stay with us and act for us forever.

On the less good side I will put the acting in the two principal roles. Contrary to the majority of the opinions I do not believe that either Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale did a memorable job here. I mean they were OK, but the roles offered much better opportunities. Scarlett Johansson is undercast here, she deserves much more interesting roles. Cinematography and sets seem to be a little bit uninspired. Yet, the greater disappointment is that there is too little magic left when the film ends.",7

18 March 2020,The trickiest magic in the world is the knot in your heart.,"If the magic in the magician is called magic, then the magic in this movie can only be called acrobatics. This movie is tearing through the magical secrets from beginning to end. All the mysteries are so bland after being broken, but they paid too much to know the bland results. At the last moments of the two magicians, I don't know if there will be remorse in their hearts. I guess they will regret it for a moment, but they will do it again.

7 January 2010,Pulling strings,"Using advanced storytelling techniques (see the Advanced Screen writing Class and the Masterpiece Software) is probably the single best way to set yourself apart from the Hollywood screen writing crowd. But this approach is extremely challenging as well, and if you aren't careful you can weaken the very story you are trying to showcase.

In their story of competing magicians, the writers of The Prestige use a double storyteller. While not uncommon in a medium like the novel, this advanced technique is extremely rare in mainstream Hollywood film. Structurally a double storyteller creates two equal main characters. When you have virtually unlimited amount of time to explore character (as in a novel), this isn't a problem. But in the relatively short two-hour time period you have in a Hollywood movie, it's a huge problem.

If you add the advanced technique of making both characters unsympathetic, you compound the problem even further. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, characters don't have to be sympathetic. But they do have to be compelling. By cross-cutting between two main characters in the time a writer normally has to define one, these writers make both of their heroes superficial and opaque.

The great strength of The Prestige is the plot. But ironically, that simply highlights the fatal weakness of the story. This film about slight of hand and trickery has plenty of slight of hand and trickery in its plot. But without the proper character work, it's all just pulling strings. By being extra complicated, the mechanics of the plot actually become more, not less, obvious. The audience pulls back and notices they are watching a movie.

Instead of showing us how clever they are, these talented writers show us how they have failed in the first job of the writer, to make the audience care.

18 August 2009,Are you watching closely??,"When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.

The Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value. This is a film that demands repeat viewings and delivers more surprises and depth with each look.",9
12 November 2006,"Well now, this is a rare case","Typically, if there is a book and then a movie, the book is the better by far. Enter Christopher Nolan, and this is no longer the case.

As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling.

There is enough foreshadowing throughout the movie to make one giddy. I loved how Nolan chose to focus much more on Borden's personal life than Priest did in the novel. All of the developing back story is gone, but what is gained is worth it in my opinion. Borden's wife, played by Rebecca Hall, was an unexpected treat. She certainly out-performed the other female lead. . .

At times, the movie was a little too enunciated, my reason for giving it a 9 and not a 10. Just a little more faith in the audience, especially at the very end, would have been nice.

As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier at the end of the movie. A real surprise though was Hugh Jackman. Of X-Men and Kate and Leopald fame, I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought, ""Wait, that's Hugh Jackman. Oh dear, good for him."" Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.

Splendid entertainment.",9
24 August 2015,A Bit Love It or Hate It; I Love It,"Let us start with a quote from the film.

""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course...it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"". "" So says the opening narration of this movie. It's one of my favorite openings in film. Though film is a visual medium, I find that a good poetic speech every now and then can make more of an impact than many sweeping shots or well-choreographed action sequences. It's not a universal opinion, to be sure. But it is definitely one that I hold. Perhaps that's due to the fact that I am a writer to the deepest, darkest, most intimate corner of my heart and soul, as you can likely tell if you've read enough of these recaps.

But if you want to talk about pure movie magic, look just to the content of the speech. Of course, it is about magicians, and it forms some detailed and resonantly captivating framework for the rest of the movie. But it could be easily construed as symbolism for the effect of movies and the movie-making process. Think about it. I did. You ground the audience in reality, take to the cinematic skies, and then stick your landing. I don't know if that was intentional. But it certainly is effective. Now, take a deep breath with me. And dive.

Once again, I am an Nolaniac. If you want to call me a fanboy, so be it. You're wrong. Dead wrong. Damn wrong. In fact, I hate that term when it is applied to those smart and thoughtful who do not deserve it that it makes my blood boil. But I've been called worse. I... do have a tendency of going off on rants, don't I? Oh well. Whatever.

But as a Nolaniac, I can safely say that this is the most Nolan-y of his movies, for better and for worse. I can safely say that there are 3 of his movies that even people who don't like his other movies or are indifferent to them all love. Those being TDK, Inception, and Memento. This is the 'measure movie', if you will. If you love this movie, you likely love Nolan movies. If you hate this movie, you likely hate Nolan movies. And if you're indifferent to this movie, you likely are indifferent to Nolan movies.

The basic plot is simple enough, particularly for a Nolan movie: two magicians try to one-up each other. But this is not just a movie about magic; it's a film about pride, folly, showmanship, desperation, and the extents to which one will go to achieve their desires, even at the cost of their own sanity. Stylishly stunning with great acting and a gripping plot, it is one of modern cinema's great marvels as well a movie that wants to be seen time and time again.

It may not be as haunting upon a second watching as Memento or as thematically resonant upon a second watching as TDK or as striking and impressive upon a second watching as Inception, it is the Nolan movie that I say reveals the most upon a second watching. Mostly due to the ending twist, which was... interesting, to say the least.

Like Interstellar, I movie which I like alright but is probably Nolan's weakest to date, many of the people who hate this film hate it because of that ending. They feel like after the curtain was pulled up, there is nothing to witness. I disagree with them, but I do admit that they make a few good points.

While it is not as big of a problem here as it is in the scientifically-minded Interstellar, the revelation of something that could conceivably called 'real magic' does mess with the tone of the film a bit. And it is not as sharp or thrilling or thought-provoking as many other Nolan movies, which is why I put in here on this list.

Of course, I can't fail to mention that this film had a golden rating from me by the time they went to visit Tesla for the first time. Though I am a film critic first, I do say that I am not a cyborg (though that would be cool) and thus am not without feelings. And while the section is gritty and dark and accurate in its depiction of the landscape of the Old West and is objectively a high point, it is the combination of Tesla (one of my favorite scientists) and Colorado Springs (where I've lived since I was born) that permanently endeared this movie to me.

Which brings me to my closing statements. This is a movie thematically about perception and like most Nolan movies, it runs along the tracks of its themes. So let me say this: your opinion of The Prestige wrests mostly on perception. If you are looking to bash on this movie, you will bash on it. If you are looking to adore this movie, you will adore it. And if you are looking with an open mind for an impressive film experience, you will not be disappointed.",10
8 October 2022,"Quirky and absorbing film, perfect for me.","This a favourite film of mine. Unusual premise, unusual characters, yes, as I said, quirky.

All the actors give a fine performance.

It is a revenge film to end all revenge films.

A film about the exploits of magicians, may not sound promising.

Would be creepy films based on vaudeville acts are usually about ventriloquists and their maniacal dummies, think ""Dead of Night"" with Michael Redgrave.

This film is full of obsession and seething hatred, which ultimately damages love, sanity and people. Overall, it is a fairly dark film, one well worth persevering with.

Given it is a film about magicians there are plenty of twists. The title of the film ""The Prestige"" relates to the final twist of a magic trick.",10

30 October 2006,Fine Looking Production Wasted on an Incoherent Script,"Christopher Nolan's latest puzzle movie is like a big heaping plate of spaghetti: when taken together, it looks like a complete and satisfying meal, but if you pick up any one noodle individually, you find that it's not connected to any of the others and just trails into nothing.

I felt like a complete moron walking out of this movie, because I completely missed the big surprise twist at the end. My wife had to explain it to me on the way home. But in thinking back on the movie, I decided that the fault did not lie with me (or so I'd like to believe). Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have written a muddled and confusing screenplay, in which every single plot detail (and there are many) gets equal weight and nothing takes central focus. The ending doesn't feel so much like a creative twist as it does a cheap trick.

The performances are fine, though none of the characters ever comes alive. There's so much intricate plot to race through that no one has time to develop any nuance into their roles, and all of the characters serve as ciphers for the plot rather than as psychologically believable and consistent individuals. Christian Bale comes off best; Hugh Jackman is as bland as ever; Michael Caine is just kind of there; and Scarlett Johannsen may as well not even be in the movie for the importance placed upon her.

Movies like ""The Prestige"" bug me. They spend all of their time trying so hard to trick and mislead that they never get around to telling a compelling story that I care anything about. Five minutes after you walk out of the theatre, the plot starts unraveling like wet Kleenex, because the film doesn't build its plot from the character level up (which the other magician film from this year, ""The Illusionist,"" did and which is why that's a better movie). ""The Prestige"" is a magic trick that leaves you wanting your money back.

Grade: B-",6
25 May 2007,Abracadabra!,"Christopher Nolan has directed wonderful movies like ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"". ""The Prestige"" continues Nolan's glorious path of becoming one of the top new film-makers in the world.

In ""The Prestige"" two friends Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) become rivals after tragic accident. First the game seems to be harmless but then rivalry becomes deathly. Both of them are trying to come up the most brilliant magic trick to become the most powerful magician. A beautiful assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) creates even more turmoil between former friends.

""The Prestige"" is a flashback movie. The editor Lee Smith has established to cut the film so that it is not hard to catch every turn. Nolan has written an adapted screenplay with his brother Jonathan which is based on a novel by Christopher Priest.

The cast is very best A-group. Especially Christian Bale is very convincing performing Alfred. Michael Caine is a man in the right place playing Robert Angier's associate Cutter. Superstar David Bowie appears in the film also.

The film holds you till the end. I recommend it to everybody who likes thriller drama with a little magic on the side!",9
23 February 2007,Secrets are my life,"I rarely sit down to write a review for a film I have seen, but this movie is well worth my time.

I have seen it three times, and honestly have thoroughly enjoyed it all three times. I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies, and I cannot at the moment think of another I can say this about.

So what is it about the prestige? Is it the BEST story? Is it the BEST acting? Is it the BEST cinematography? I would say the answer to these three questions is probably no, not BEST, but very very good. When a film can succeed in such a way on so many levels, it makes a lasting impression. The Prestige is definitely this type of movie, and one of the most entertaining I've ever seen.

The acting is marvelous. Maybe nothing Oscar worthy, but this movie didn't call for that type of role. Christian Bale is perfectly mysterious, Hugh Jackman is spot on as a revenge seeking widower, and Michael Caine adds exactly the right support to bring it all together.

The cinematography and art direction really give this movie the mood it needs to be memorable. You will be sucked in to its mystery, and each scene will keep you on the brink of illusion and reality.

Christopher Nolan's touch of teeter tottering timelines may frustrate the casual viewer, but it will challenge and entertain those who are ready to tackle the secrets of the film. You will be guessing and guessing, hoping for that home run of an ending, and trust me...it's a grand slam. You will not be disappointed. Better than Memento.

But what is it that takes this from a great movie to a masterpiece? For me it was the sounds. The mysterious score added wonder to all the right moments, making this more than a movie, but an experience that I will look forward to being a part of again and again.

Every element was there, every aspect executed in superb fashion. A 10 if there ever could be one. Movie-making magic!",10
31 January 2007,this stylish thriller perfectly works on many levels,"The Prestige is a stylish thriller, story about obsession, magic trick and metaphor of a film art at the same time. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) the movie perfectly works on every level. On the most obvious level - it is a superbly shot thriller keeping in a heart-pounding suspense with numerous twists and turns. As regards psychology, we have a dangerous obsession with searching for something new and an intense rivalry between two different personalities, which is reliable owing to excellent performances by two leads - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Their characters are not only obsessed with personal ambitions, but they also resign from family life by hurting people they love. In the allegorical sense, the flick is an overt metaphor of the magic trick in which creators show more things than actually communicate and viewers' aim is to decipher a riddle. Besides, they often reveal secrets concerning the enchantment. Finally, Nolan focuses on a labourious creation process. Filmmakers, just like illusionists in this movie, do everything within their power in order to amuse viewers and the effect is sometimes incommensurate to their hard work and devoted time. To conclude, The Prestige is a first-rate cinematic experience which both criticizes and glorifies film-making.",9
21 October 2006,Three Parts Of A Magic Trick,"The Pledge:

Christopher Nolan, the brilliant man who brought us Memento and Batman Begins and soon The Dark Knight, brings us The Prestige. Starring Hugh Jackman, Wolverine from the X-Men movies and soon to have his own film, and Christian Bale, Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The movie is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Jackman and Bale respectively.

The Turn:

Their rivalry is something more than two competitors. It becomes about revenge. Eventually one of them discovers an amazing trick. Soon the other becomes obsessed with finding the secret. Everything he does becomes about finding the secret to the first trick. Later he finds an even better trick. A trick so astounding that not even the man who builds most of the tricks can understand it.

The Prestige:

Trusts are broken. Loyalties are tested. Loves are lost. Watch the movie carefully. This one requires you to pay attention and follow along. The movie is told in a non-linear format, even more so than Memento. There are subtle clues in almost every scene. This is no movie to text-message, make out, talk with friends, or even go to the bathroom during. Each and every scene helps to build to this mystery of what's going on. Missing one scene means certain confusion. It's not something you can half pay attention to. Even if you do pay attention you might just have to see it again just to see all the build up to the final trick.

The Response:

Amazing. Though if you found Memento confusing you may want to skip this one. But if you're a Christopher Nolan fan or always like a good mystery you will be sure to enjoy this one. Enjoy this one while you can. Movies with this level of excitement do not come around too often.",8

22 February 2007,Reminded me of the Usual Suspects,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
21 November 2006,Two Face,"""Batman Begins"" 's sequel may not be the one you think it is. If the end of the last Christopher Nolan's picture introduces a new and laughing threat in Gotham City, which will indeed face the Jocker in 2008, it also announces complex narrative ideas, that ""The Prestige"" greatly develops.

Inspector James Gordon, portrayed in ""Batman Begins"" like a pessimistic crime philosopher, theorized evil as a mimetic spiral, saying that if justice uses masks, tricks and theatrical fear, like the Batman does, the villains he fights will do the same. The two faces will always imitate them-self, in a perfect symmetry that leads to more elaborated weapons and increase the level of violence. ""The Prestige"", even before this confrontation between the Batman and the Jocker, illustrates Gordon's statement, through the confrontation between two magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, for those who dreamed about a cinematographic crossover between Batman and Wolverine...) in the dark streets of London in the late XIX century (those who lived there or read ""From Hell"" know what I'm talking about). And of course,as the movie goes on, their fight becomes more and more dramatic, more and more epic, and more and more violent.

""The Prestige"" already transcends Nolan's filmography and could be seen like the artistic apogee of his career (for now on), because it mixes the great storytelling style of ""Batman Begins"" and ""Insomnia"" with the experimental narration and style of ""Fallowing"" and ""Memento"". The film also develops thematics from the previous Nolan's movies, such as the dualism of the characters, which always are in the edge of madness, the obsession which leads to the lost of your humanity, the constant in and go in time, which loses the spectator into the tortured consciences of the characters (but you always understand everything because of the intelligence and the finesse of the construction), etc. This great storytelling, mixed with this accurate style defines what we can call ""narrative realism"". This means that all the realistic elements of the movies only goes to maintain the dramatic progression of the plot and to develops the themes of the movie. That gives the impression that the story and its progression is all that matters in the movie, but that it only works because of the complexity of the style that underlines it : multiplicity of the points of view, intermix of the time lines, suspensions of the revelations, etc. ""Narrative realism"", which can regroups cinematographer like Nolan, but also Shyamalan, creates a new form of modernity, in with the storyline is essential - whereas it isn't in post-modern cinema, as you can experience it with Lynch or Tarantino 's movies. You enjoy fallowing the plot of the movie, but you also take great pleasure in its complex structure, which is clever and modern.

In my opinion, such a fun redefinition of cinematographic modernity hasn't occur in American cinema since David Fincher's ""Fight Club"".",9

7 February 2023,An absolute gem,"This is one of my all time favorite films. It's clever, well made, well acted, well directed and the scenes and camera work are impeccable, and impeccably timed. The plot and narrative is tight, gripping and keeps you guessing with some genuinely suprising OMG moments (unless of course you're clever enough to work it out - or boring enough to ""read-up"" on the film beforehand).

One of my favourite aspects of the film is the competitive one-upmanship between the 2 leads; the rivalry is palpable. I honestly can't get enough of it. The way it moves them to push the boundaries of their creativity, deviousness and preparedness to to do whatever is takes to win, no matter what the cost, speaks volumes to their utter obsession with their craft.

If you like good films, and aren't hung up on genre, I highly recommend this gem of a film.",10
16 March 2009,Amazing film!! One of the best of the decade!!,"I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.

Hugh Jackman(who finally makes a great film outside of X-Men.) Brings his acting to whole other world, he pulls no stops to be cruel and vicious. He brings a great darkness the likes we have never seen and an obsessive nature like on other. Christian Bale(Who in my opinion stole the show.) Is another who rocks the house in this film, he brings a more sadistic side than Jackman and really almost out classes him in this film. Bale really steps up his game and brings a whole new level of obsessive rivalry to this movie. But all in all the whole cast does magnificently in this handsomely mounted film.

The Prestige is not your average film, it requires strict and complete attention to truly grasp and understand the story and plot. Kind of like The Matrix if you sneeze you will lose what is going on in the film, it's that complex. But when you get to understand it and know it it really is a truly magnificent film and a really treat to watch on screen. But I have just one request if you watch this movie, watch very closely because nothing in this film is what it really seems.",10

12 July 2023,Captivating Masterpiece,"""The Prestige"" holds a special place among my all-time favorite films. It's a rare gem that captivates you, compelling you to root for one of the two main characters like few other movies can. Personally, I found myself consistently aligned with Christian Bale's character throughout. However, the twists in this film surpass expectations, surpassing what one might anticipate from a story centered around magicians. The plot is both remarkable and distinct, mesmerizing viewers from start to finish. And of course, the undeniable allure of Scarlett Johansson and the consummate skill of Michael Caine add an extra layer of beauty and expertise. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to everyone.

19 December 2006,Complex Plot with Twists upon Twists and a Horrific and Shocking Ending,"I went to this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. Only about one in eight seats in the theater were taken, not that many. Most of the people in the audience seemed young.

The movie starts off ordinarily. The first half is a series of events. The movie jumps from one time period to another. Many scenes left me scratching my head. A magic trick consists of three stages: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Like a magic trick the movie started out ordinary. Borden and Angier are two magicians in deep rivalry. They go to great lengths to sabotage the other's work. It got to the point where every time they were performing a magic trick on stage I would anticipate something would go wrong. Many of these tricks involved guns and axes, so I was preparing myself for something very loud and shocking.

After about halfway through the rather ordinary story of rivalry turns interesting as the two magicians read their diaries. But still I felt disoriented and didn't fully grasp everything. Towards the end though, everything made sense, and the plot fell together. It is a very complex and very shocking story. It is not just the plot that was excellent. The film seemed to have a lot to say in terms of themes. I won't give away too much but at the end the little girl Jess watches the magic trick that involves the little bird disappearing. She's amazed by it. She may want to know how the trick is done but once you realize how it is done it's probably not a good idea to tell her. Essentially the world is simple, cold, cynical, and miserable, but these tricks give happiness because they suggest this is not so. This deception is not isolated to simple magic tricks. The vanishing bird trick is analogous to what happens to the magicians. Some people will go to great lengths for an art.

I enjoyed this film not just for its plot. I started to think that deception is just in the magic shows. They are not just in the characters and their lives. They are everywhere. It watched this movie six days before Christmas and in many ways Santa Clause is a magic trick, a deception. But it's more than that. I look at the football fans in stadiums and wonder whether they are just individuals proud of their teams or country or whether they are just totally deceived by marketers. In my life pretty much everything that gave me happiness turned out to be quite simple, quite pessimistic in reality, whether it's religion, family, or love. There is no magic, just science. There is no emotion, just biochemistry. No country, just politics. No morality, just power. Like the vanishing bird trick, you just don't want to know how it's done.

Now when I spoke to people after the movie most of them didn't mention these ideas to me. They were too busy asking me about the mechanics of the plot, who was who, why this happened, and so on. But I think if you plan to watch the movie you should focus on more than what happened on screen. Try to infer certain concepts from the film and relate these to what you already know from experience in your own life. You may be quite surprised.

The movie probably shouldn't be seen by small children. One reason is because of the on-screen deaths that occur.",10

17 November 2006,Go see it and judge for yourselves,"This film seems to have polarised IMDb posters like no other for a while.

I don't know if it is a trick (sic) of time but the posts at the top of this list seem to love it and the posts at the bottom hate it. Is this due to having had time to think about it before commenting? In my case no. I came out of the theatre thinking what a good film, but by the morning, what a great film.

The mere fact that it plays on the mind, and requires a lot of thought to see some of the holes (yes there are some but not as clearly dismissed as in some other films)gives an indication of the impact it had on me.

I had to laugh at the comments over the accents and ""mumbling"". It's called English. It is not ""American English"". I don't criticise American actors for talking in American accents, so please don't do the same to my native tongue.

My only advice here is go and see it for yourself if you have not already. Oh and look up a certain Nikola Tesla on Wikipedia if this name is not familiar to you.

And finally, don't forget, it's a film. And fiction. It's not real, or historic. Enjoy it. I did.",9
13 July 2022,Great adaptation of the okay book,"I thought the book was good, it was interesting with a cool concept, but it was missing a lot. This movie added everything I could have possibly asked for. Fantastic characters and acting, such a great story. I have rewatched so many times and am still blown away by every element of this story. The ending will completely blow away your expectations, and will do it again and again and again up until the very end.

4 August 2008,The real mystery is the praise this film received,"Christopher Priest's novel novel on which the film was based is to my mind by far the least interesting of his that I have read. It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted ""The Illusionist"" is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale.",3
14 February 2007,Ruining the Good Name of the Mystery...,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

11 November 2006,The Prestige is Superb,"""The Prestige"" is a superb drama. It represents the struggle between two masterful magicians in London. Hugh Jackman gives a superior performance as the tall handsome Robert Angier. And Christian Bale plays Alfed Borden, the counterpoint in this exciting and slickly done cinema. Scarlett Johansson is the younger attractive blonde wife, Olivia Wenscombe, who assists in unraveling the competitive nature of the constant battle. One is particularly impressed with the cinematography and muted color that only enhances the enjoyment. The young daughter, Sarah Borden, gives an adequate child performance as the fulcrum of Christian Bale's plight. And last but not least is Michael Caine's portrayal of Cutter, the magic show manager who weaves this tale in a suspenseful fashion to the delight of the entire audience. It is a remarkable film that is likely to be a top contender this year.

22 September 2007,Story-telling at its finest,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as a pair of young, up-and-coming magicians who start out as friends, but eventually become the bitterest of rivals with each man obsessed with finding out the other's methods.

What amazes me is just how well told the story is. It pulls you in with the opening scene and just doesn't let go. The film doesn't follow a linear path. Instead, it starts off by providing a glimpse of film's final stages and then goes back and fills you in on what happened to arrive at that point. The film frequently jumps between different time periods, in some places juggling three time periods at once, but it's done so well that it's never confusing about where you are in the story.

The subject matter deals with magicians and their methods for tricking audiences. What really makes it interesting is that the film is put together like a giant magic trick. When you reach the end, everything just falls into place and fits perfectly. Repeat viewings don't detract from the movie at all. Rather, they simply add more depth to the overall story. You gain a greater appreciation for the acting and story-telling and are more aware of how the film's props hint at the story's eventual outcome.

The performances are fantastic all around. Hugh Jackman gives a noteworthy performance as Robert Angier, an originally decent man who has allowed himself to become twisted with hate and obsession with learning fellow magician Alfred Borden's tricks. Christian Bale delivers a top notch performance as Borden, the target of Angier's obsession. The excellence of Bale's performance isn't as immediately obvious, but during repeat viewings subtleties and nuances of his performance that are tough to spot the first time become more obvious. Lastly, Michael Caine is excellent in a supporting role.

All told, this is just one fantastically made movie. Highly recommended. 9/10",9
18 August 2007,"Outstanding, Beautiful, wondrous ... I'm running out of words to describe this awesome movie!","Its surprising how a movie about 2 magicians actually managed to reach a producers table, but I am glad it did.

""The prestige"" comes like a breath of fresh air, considering the mediocre fare, us moviegoers are being served these days and as usual Christopher Nolan doesn't disappoint. Christopher is quite deftly carving a name for himself among the best directors of this generation and has followed phenomenal movies such as Memento and Batman Begins with another masterpiece. There are not many directors who can boast of having their last 3 movies in the IMDb top 250 list.

The movie takes on an unusual tale of the story of 2 magicians and weaves a poignant drama around it. Full of suspense and mystery. Without revealing too much, I would implore all you viewers to give this movie a dekko, and you will not be disappointed. If the suspense of Memento intrigued you, if the dark and poignant drama of ""Batman begins"" thrilled you, then The Presitge, will take over and take you to a world of envy, jealousy, suspense, drama and yes .. prestige.

Enjoy!",10

23 November 2017,Pretty people in pretty costumes,"As sometimes happens in Hollywood, two films with extremely similar plots are released the same year—Capote and In Cold Blood, Florence Foster Jenkins and The Florence Foster Jenkins Story, The Darkest Hour and Churchill—Christopher Nolan's The Prestige came out the same year as Neil Burger's The Illusionist. If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman. Both plots seem to dance around someone who will stop at nothing in his quest to find out the truth behind the magic tricks. I've seen both films all the way through, and I still have trouble telling them apart.

If you're looking for eye candy to go along with your magician story, The Prestige is the one to rent. Hugh Jackman, in his clean-cut handsomeness, is the star. If you liked him in Kate and Leopold, you'll be very happy to hear he looks almost identical in The Prestige. He and Christian Bale spar off one another, since they both seem to be master illusionists—oh, wait, that's the word from the other film. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is Hugh's girlfriend and assistant, and Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Roger Rees join the supporting cast.

Christopher Nolan, creator of the slew of Batman remakes, cast two of his favorite actors in this film after working with them in Batman Begins: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. It's really nice to see the actors and actresses working well off each other, which isn't particularly surprising since most of them worked together in various films before. While some of the twists and turns of the plot are entertaining, as is usual with a Christopher Nolan script, as the end credits roll, audiences are able to find some flaws if they choose to think about it. However, if you like Nolan's films, or magic movies, or like to watch pretty people in pretty costumes, rent this one for an entertaining evening.",6
22 October 2006,Are you watching closely?The Prestige,"Well it appears Oscar season is upon us. The release of all the films studios have been hiding from projectors until they can be freshly ingrained in voters' minds has commenced. We had the obligatory Scorsese film a couple weeks ago and now we have the return of one of Hollywood's new favorite sons (who also began with intelligent and original indie visions like Marty) with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Known for uniquely dark and smart suspense thrillers, Nolan has crafted a tale of mysterious intrigue concerning two rival magicians vying to be the greatest to have ever lived. One is a performer of high esteem (Hugh Jackman), if not talented enough to create his own tricks, and the other a wizard with sleight of hand (Christian Bale) yet stoic and matter-of-fact with his audience. Obsession overcomes the humanity of each as they soon delve into the darkness of their core beings to prove themselves superior. If you truly wish to succeed, you must be willing to get your hands dirty.

I must say that I usually hate figuring out a movie's secret before its' big reveal at the conclusion. To say that Nolan has laid his out for all to see purposely might not be far from the truth. I hope he has done so consciously as it adds immensely to the film's enjoyability. This is a film about illusion and tricks that can be explained if necessary. The beauty of magic, however, is the audience's unconscious desire to never find out what really happened. As one character says in the film, it becomes so obvious once the trick has been unraveled. What a movie like The Illusionist failed to do was accept the intelligence of its audience. They tried so hard to hide the telestrated finale that when it finally happened you felt cheated. Nolan understands what is so appealing about illusion, we want to figure out what happens ourselves, to see the obvious and apply it to the cloaked result. He tells the tale like a magic trick, showing his hand the entire way yet still being able to keep the film suspenseful and enjoyable right to the final frame as we wait to see what direction we are led.

Bale and Jackman prove themselves to be the heavyweights that they are in the acting field. They embody their characters fully and are able to go from friendly comradery to bitter hatred throughout the course of this labyrinthine story bouncing from flashback to flashback. The rivalry is tautly told as they begin to discover a new layer of the other with each diary page turn, stolen from their counterpart. These are actors playing performers who have chosen a life for themselves, where they must act every single day. Their personas for stage and family are not the same, and this disparity helps to slowly destroy them both. Sacrifice and pain will always supercede love and happiness for a person driven to be the best at what they do.

Surprising applause goes to Scarlett Johansson for a performance that doesn't try to be more than it is. She is not bad as a supporting character when there isn't much for her to destroy. The half-smile/pursed lips look runs rampant, but doesn't reek amateurism as it usually does when she attempts to carry a film herself. The true supporting roles, however, lie with Andy Serkis and David Bowie as assistant to and Nikola Tesla respectively. It is a real shame that Bowie doesn't act more, as I have never seen a bad performance from him thus far after now five films. He embodies the mysterious enigma that Tesla was: a mad-scientist of sorts trying to help the world with his often-irregular ideas. It is also a pleasure to see Serkis not being just a prop like he has been as Golem and King Kong in Peter Jackson's last two epics. The guy has some real screen presence and the ability to transform into whatever a director needs for his film.

It is also good to see Nolan go back to the inventive storytelling that he became noticed for. While not as intricate as his debut Following (told in a story pattern consisting of three timeframes going a, b, c, a, b, c) and his masterpiece sophomore effort Memento (told backwards in small chunks), The Prestige is not a straight-forward story like his last film Batman Begins or the lone-blemish on his resume, the inferior remake to a great Norwegian suspenser, Insomnia. The use of flashback, while both characters read the diary of each other, is a nice device which never feels gimmicky. These are stories of intelligent men and who better to narrate for the audience then the leads themselves as they narrate for each other. Dark thrillers don't come better than this one very often and while the touches of science fiction and the supernatural may turn some realists off towards the film's conclusion, I believe they work well within the confines of the world we are being shown. Every sacrifice taken is the obvious conclusion to its' string of events, leading up to the final dénouement that will leave your minds in contemplation, not from confusion so much as an evaluation of your own ways of living and lengths you are willing to go, for hours to follow.",9

25 September 2023,Great acting & cast; plot has few big holes to make this a fantasy film,"Enjoyable film IF viewer ignores obvious plot flaws. Hugh Jackman is born in ""top class"" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.

The other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced ""magician engineer"" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.

Acting is excellent from entire cast. If one can not dwell on obvious plot flaws, this film is enjoyable & rewatchable.",7

16 April 2020,great,"Before the birth of movies, magic was probably the most magical entertainment in human society. However, the emergence of movies means that human vision has entered a more magical era. From this perspective, movies are undoubtedly another kind of magic. The prestige organically integrates the traditional entertainment of ""magic"" into the film, and allows the magic show to continuously drive the story forward. There is magic in the film, and beyond the magic is the film. The twin brother, the copy person and so on have the element of magical colour to also be mixed in among them, true true false, false true true, fell into a kind of inarticulate and inarticulate but meaningful ending finally in. Magic is deceptive, the movie is creating illusion, but in this unpredictable illusion, we can feel the infinite reality.

18 February 2007,The Prestige,"The Prestige Prestige is about rivalry between two young magicians, who turn from friend to foe due to a mistake in which the lover of one magician is killed. This results in both the magician trying to out-play each other in each and every magic trick they perform, leading in the end to one magician being killed by the other. The story is about the twist and turns, flash-backs and magic-tricks. The plot is set up in early 20th century London. The direction is good. By the time the movie is little bit more than half  way over, you will realize the possibility of the mystery that the director is trying to evade your eyes. Than the remaining movie you will watch just to see whether the director brings a new turn to the story, and does it not match your sense of analysis. To mine it matched  but the movie is a bit beyond our knowing director's mystery. There are many twists and turns to confuse the viewers, may be the director expected the viewer to have a second go at the movie to properly understand and put the zig-saw puzzle in order. Would I venture for another viewing to better understand what happened in the movie? No, I would not.

Both the lead actors  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale  play their role with conviction. Michael Caine as an adviser to Hugh Jackman also fits well in that character's role. There are two heroines  Piper Perabo - playing wife of Christian, and Scarlett Johansson  playing assistant and mistress for both magician from time to time.

Is there a thrill in the movie? A Bit. Is there a mystery in the movie? A forced mystery  the director after taking so many twists and turn in the script could had the freedom to end the movie any which way he was happy with. Every or any ending in this movie would be a mystery.

4 May 2016,Another mind-boggler by Christopher Nolan,"As Christopher Nolan also directed Inception and Memento, it is no surprise that the Prestige is a complete mind-boggler. The Prestige is a great film because it is multi-layered, intricately written and demands the full attention of the viewer. It often cross-cuts back and forth between two separate narratives, which means you need to be completely engaged in the film or you'll end up confused. I've also never seen a film about magicians and showmanship before, so the Prestige opened up my eyes to a whole new film genre. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson were all great as the leads.

24 January 2007,A wonderful flick filled with tricks,"It's always nice to see a director-actor duo collaborate in successive projects, especially when they can be removed from the massive studio work situation that surrounds a film like Batman Begins, which is where we find Nolan and Bale, filling in time between Bat films. A subsequent pairing allows the director and actor to further their relationship and speak in a kind of shorthand, bringing their collaboration to new heights. Think of Scorcese-DeNiro and Scorcese-DiCaprio, or Spike Lee-Denzel Washington for examples of this.

The term relationship is key, as The Prestige centers around the relationships the characters have with each other and what is perceived as their connective tissue plays both within and beyond the film. The audience is placed in a very strategic position of both knower and seeker of knowledge, and like a good magic trick, it is what we perceive and expect that will equally guide us and trick us towards the final act, or what is referred to in magic circles, as ""The Prestige"".

Nolan's previous work (Memento, Following, Insomnia) has built upon his manipulation of audience engagement with film texts, and tweaking our sophisticated knowledge as viewers in such a way that our work as an audience helps propel the film as we are forced to guess, then second guess our preconceived notions of where his films are headed. Without recognizing our intelligence as an audience, the film would have no place to go.

The psychology of Nolan's films are like that of a masterful storyteller, akin to Robertson Davies' Fifth Business set of novels. The make up and structure of the medium, whether it is writing or film-making, or magic tricks, is key to the enjoyment of the medium's content. We are well aware as we watch The Prestige, how the film unfolds in three acts, exactly as the magic pieces are described in the film. It is both a pleasure to behold on a story level, as well as a film level. Technically, it is parlaying exactly what it is being mystically told as the plot develops. This movie is a classic example why film schools exist.

Without giving too much away, this film is a pleasure on many levels, and worth subsequent viewings to fully appreciate and explore. The cast is perfect, as Bale and Jackman play two anti-heroes, whose sides we can easily assume or oppose, depending on how one reads the film and the characters' motives. Johansson plays a wonderful femme fatale, who we never can quite trust. Is she part of the illusion, or the only source of truth? Where does Caine's character's loyalties lie? His performance may perhaps be the best of the bunch, another testament to how prior work with a director leads to greater performances in their own ability to work in shorthand with each other.

If you can't tell by my tongue tied review, this film has volumes to speak about. Another thought provoking piece to add to Nolan's young but impressive resume.

13 November 2010,"Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians.","Christopher Nolan directed seven films so far, and The Prestige is his worst one. It's not necessarily bad though. The Prestige is typical Nolan filmmaking. There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius.",7
14 November 2006,Proof that an ending can make or break a movie,"Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.

""The Prestige"" is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.

Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with ""Memento"" and rejuvenated the ailing ""Batman"" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of ""Insomnia,"" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of ""The Prestige."" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.

In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the ""Saw"" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, ""The Prestige""'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.

In ""Secret Window,"" Johnny Depp told us: ""The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good."" Too bad the same can't be said for ""The Prestige,"" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater.",6

29 October 2006,"""A man's reach often exceeds his grasp""","Big fan of Nolan's ever since Memento; I still think his best film thus far is his first full-length feature: Following. The Prestige is undoubtedly his most ambitious film thus far, and it is mesmerizing, no question. By the end, however, I felt that style won out over substance just a bit.

Great acting throughout, with Michael Caine being a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod. Bale (who, like Caine, is always great) and Jackman (who convinced me finally that he can indeed act) are perfectly cast as the dueling magicians. Bowie, I felt, was also perfect as Tesla - an elegant performance from an always-elegant performer.

The movie does have those 3 acts, just like in a successful 'trick': the Pledge, the Turn, and the all-important Prestige. This film does deliver on all three, even if it stumbles just a little on the execution.

2 May 2019,what a prestige really!,"Usually when I watch something that is longer than two hours I always feel like the timing is too much even if I liked the movie. But here I didn't even feel how the hours passed! This amazing cinematography, brilliant acting and original story captured my mind for two hours straight and then left me with an open mouth at the end. I swear, this movie deserves even a higher rate. It's marvelously good. Struggle for victory, obsession of the lead characters to be the best and let's not forget, there's twist and excitement all over the place, The Prestige has everything to be a masterpiece. And it is. I'm doing you a favor by saying you should watch it! You don't wanna miss this.

17 February 2015,Interesting Duality Concept on Dark Competitive Spirits of Professional Magicians,"Before the successful of their big blockbusters, the Nolan's siblings explore the world of stage magicians by summarising the magic performances into three parts - the pledge, the turn and the prestige, which the movie further develops based on the structures although it starts off slowly with its own unique beginning. It seems that in most Nolan's film, the ending scene always appears at the opening but his narrative style however manages to make audiences to forget that regardless on the complexity of the content he tries to confuse us, it is actually a straightforward plot with the key answers already revealed indirectly at the first scene. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity. Although with a bit of weaker scores (due to no Hans Zimmer), Nolan's smart piece of magical art is interesting to stress that the trick of victory comes only when a person overlook and think that he has already won the rival.",10
11 December 2020,Wasted premise,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",4
26 December 2021,Real Magic!,"This is a masterpice of storytelling, brought togheter in such an incredible way. The way Nolan sets the timeline makes you stick ot the screen the first time you watch it. But it is also always as incredible when you watch it the second time and the third time, and believe me i've experienced it and it never gets old. This is one of the best acting performance in history. The movie succeed in portraying the hapiness, horror and sadness of life. The characters are also really interresting. The final twist is... simply Insane. The ending is what we can call a magic trick, yes Nolan made a movie about magician but in fact, HE is the real magician. We now can all understand an obsession. This movie is on the same level has is other movies ( Inception, The Dark Knight, Memento...). This is a must for anyone to watch.

28 May 2007,Under the Radar 10 star movie,"Hugh Jackman Is on fire!!!! Every movie he touches is great. A spectacular actor. Chris Nolan (the director) is also on fire. All his movies seem to be fantastic. This is not really a period piece even though it is set in Victorian England, but told not through the repressive usual way, but from the way that Victorian England was also a time of great amazement, People all over sought amazement as this time was the height of science and therefore pseudo-science. This movie has the best storyline ever. the Storyline is itself a magic trick and you won't know how it comes together till the end and when you do, it's a bit scary. A great movie totally under the radar of great blockbusters but I wouldn't have it any other way.

31 January 2007,A Masterpiece of Originality,"It is not often that we are given the privilege to see a truly original story, not a remake with different faces and effects but instead a unique tale. It is a regular complaint by movie enthusiasts that the business is dominated by copied or reworked story lines. This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'",10

2 November 2006,One of the best EVER....seriously!!!!,"I went into this film a bit apprehensive, I can't lie. Having enjoyed Nolan's first two films immensely, being slightly disappointed by his third ( though I have this feeling I need to give it a second chance) and totally digging his fourth.come one Bale as Batman it's a no brainer! Needless to say I didn't quite know what to expect. Part of me felt this was a little side film in the interim between Bat flicks (stupidI know that now) Part of me was hoping he hadn't completely gone Hollywood. Literally 30 seconds into The Prestige and all doubts just floated away. Nolan is back in a big way, and I cant emphasize this next statement enough.if you haven't seen this film get off you're a$$ right now and see it. Stop reading this review and just go!! What can I say? I was utterly blown away by this film. Everything was amazing about it, the story ( who knew a film about magicians could be this good), the cinematography, the editing/pacing, the performances all top notch. It is a film that is at least on par w/his previous work and arguably his best so far. One of the best times I've had at the movies everand I see a lot of films. You see I went in not knowing much other than this was a new Nolan film and the cast. I hadn't even a seen a trailer yet. Perhaps this was why I was in such awe of the story. Though that's not it entirely, the story combined with its non linear presentation has this way of grabbing hold of you and not letting go until the finale. The structure is brilliant, with out giving to much away the film is for the most part told from journal entries being read by the films two leads. The story is told in a non-linear fashion that is a bit confusing but you will quickly get a a handle on things. Or maybe I'm just slower than everyone else lol. I could go on forever about how ever aspect of the film was brilliant but that would just be time your not watching the filmand quite honestly if you've already seen it then you already know. Or maybe you don't and you think I'm a complete dork for digging this silly film about magicians.",9
12 April 2007,Simply Awesome,"It has to be among the best movies made for quite some time. Christopher Nolan has again proved to be a gem. Christian Bale does his role with ease. All the characters just fit in so easy. Who ever thought that a story on eighteenth century magicians could be so interesting, involving and damn it, I have to agree it was deceptive, it does not fit in with the mind boggling sci-fi movie category but the script was so well written, that one cant just appreciate the movie if he does not get involved with it. The logic for a part of the ending can be conceived with many possible start points, but the beauty of this movie is, whatever be the start point and whatever be the path of your reasoning, you'll end up saying ""wow"" to the end. You might continue to debate on the nuances behind ""how it could have happened"", but you'll never debate on the quality of this gem. Congrats Mr. Nolan, ""The Prestige"" is the rightful successor to ""Memento"".

13 March 2007,Seems like some of the film is missing..because not everything adds up...,"In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.

Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.

Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.

At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.

Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.

Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.

Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment.",6

17 April 2011,Are YOU watching closely...?,"A film about magicians, friendship, jealously and rivalry. It's very hard to sell this film and to try to explain it without giving too much of the (pardon the pun) 'magic' away. A tale of two magicians set in Victorian England where their friendship turns sour when an act they routinely perform goes horribly wrong. The pair part company and a rivalry ensues. A bitter feud emerges when they both try to outdo each other with an array of tricks and illusions. From the outset it may seem like this film is all about magic and the art of illusion, but it isn't.

Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows a similar structure to his previous effort Memento where the narrative doesn't start at A and follow on to B. Instead there is flashbacks and flash forwards, as the reveal and revelation is slowly bought forward. We embark on a merry-go-round where we are left guessing where it stops and where we get off, but the level of intrigue that it creates just keeps you wanting more. To truly enjoy, appreciate and most importantly understand the film, your attention is required from start to finish and focus must be retained throughout. It's not a film you can switch off and come back to.

From the off, we are given an explanation of the three part structure to every major trick, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. The prestige is the final reveal, the re-appearance from a disappearing act, making the impossible seem possible... What follows is a trail where the magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) accused of murdering his rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). From there on in the story unfolds with Borden reading Angier's diary where the first flashback occurs and the start of complex twists and turns showing how they started out as friends and with the eventual fall out which turns them to bitter rivals, with Angier trying to uncover how Borden achieves his greatest magic trick 'the transported man' and out do him.

Funnily enough, this film so weirdly different and it's not what you'd expect. It set in Victorian England yet it never once feels like a period drama. Detail is key, as the focus is with the characters and never the background. Of course the costume and setting provides the backdrop for the story but the main theme is about obsession.

Both leads (Bale and Jackman) are on fine form and the rest of the supporting cast raises the bar. The performances are subtle and sublime, with the nuances and deliberate misdirection to mislead us into thinking who we see as the bad guy may not be the villain of the piece. That isn't to say that there is a villain but nothing is ever clear in this wonderfully realised screenplay.

Such an understated film with much to get your brain cells a work out, there's a lot to take in and you may not see everything the first time round but as the first lines mentions ""are you watching closely?"" there is a lot to admire about how the whole thing is constructed and like any great magic trick, the film only allows the audience enough details to carefully reveal the smaller pieces of a puzzle where we, the audience have to fit together to see the bigger picture. Is what we see the real truth or is there something more otherworldly, supernatural or unexplainable. With elements of science fiction thrown in you wonder whether things can get any weirder but when the final act is revealed you may well feel cheated or left feeling a sense of wonderment and just like a magic trick, you think to yourself, how did they pull that off? if you liked my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com",10

20 February 2017,An interesting story about two disgusting characters.,"This film addresses the intense rivalry between two illusionists who try to overcome and injure each other after a serious and fatal accident in a joint show. It's a story of unbridled rivalry, revenge, pride and vanity. The film has many merits but the main one is the script, the story that tells us. There are some more predictable parts, others seem initially incomprehensible until the movie explains everything. The ending is one of the most positive aspects as it's totally unexpected and, in fact, makes everything else worthwhile. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman played the main characters, working very well together and showing us the best of each other. They are brilliantly aided by veteran Michael Caine and by Scarlett Johansson. David Bowie is a surprise, but was quite reasonable in the role of the famous physicist Tesla. In fact, the whole cast did a good job and met expectations, at times when it failed to shine. However, the great problem of this film is precisely the characters. They are detestable, especially the magicians. No one was able to deserve my sympathy and, deep down, I was glad to see both of them being punished for their wickedness. Caine, in his character, mirrored this repulsion very well at certain scenes. And while Tesla's machine allowed a good increment to the story, the way it was done was so far-fetched that it spoiled the movie a bit, too. Anyway, it's a good movie with a very interesting story, fulfilling well its mission to entertain and surprise the public.",6

18 June 2007,Abracadabra.,"The Prestige sees two rivaling magicians, Borden and Angier, in an intensive battle of wits that goes so far that their lives at stake. The two are portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who deliver powerful performances, supported by an excellent cast of Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and, guess who, yep, David Bowie.

Director Chris Nolan again shows his trademark by going back and forth the storyline as the film progresses, much as he's done with the critically-acclaimed Memento and Batman Begins, which, through his skillful execution, is used to tremendous effect. With involvement from his brother, Jonathan Nolan, the duo are able to recreate the suspense and complexity as shown in Memento, intriguing the audience as they are brought deeper and deeper into the story.

This is story-telling at its finest. With a tremendous twist ending that ties up the knots neatly but also leaves out some tiny loose ends, the movie is satisfying but will make you sit through the credits, thinking you might have missed something...",8

22 October 2006,A sorry excuse for a movie,"There is nothing profound or interesting about this movie. It is choppy and confusing, and seems like it drags on forever. It has long series of plot holes instead of a plot. The two main characters are neither interesting nor likable. The main premise (which leads to the great ""denouement"" at the end) is not only obvious, it's ridiculous. The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it. It's about a couple of guys so consumed by mutual hatred and envy that they can't seem to get a life of their own. This movie makes The Illusionist seem plausible and coherent by comparison. A waste of talent, especially Michael Caine's.

22 March 2007,Now you see it...now you don't. See it!,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are magicians who constantly try to one-up one another in this excellent film. Michael Caine is the mastermind behind the tricks. Scarlett Johansson is one of the magician's assistants. David Bowie is, get this, Nicola Tesla the great inventor. The film is clever, with plot twists galore and the ending is interesting, although you may figure it out if you are the type who always tries to figure out how a magic trick is done. Solid acting from everyone, interesting sets, and the film has a great look to it. Don't expect any historical accuracy. This is just a film with a very clever premise which is basically to try to trick the audience until the very end.

26 August 2015,An entertaining thriller but I've seen better films from Nolan,"This is a good movie as a whole but I feel that Nolan overdid it on the plot twists this time. In my opinion, Memento and Inception are much better films.

2 rival stage magicians attempt to outdo one another by performing their magic show and trying to cause as much damage as possible to the other one's career after a tragic accident.

The films score is just okay. It fits great with the movie but I didn't find it as listenable on its own. Its combination of notes and chords isn't anything new that we haven't seen before. I feel that its music is just sound effects which are choreographed well with the film.

Nolan is known for his elaborate, non-linear movie plots. Here, he relied on plot twist after plot twist before the final major plot twist at the end. Although this made for some good scenes, I feel that he overdid it way too much. After 1 plot twist happens, it confuses you for a bit. But before you're able to catch your breath, the movie hits you with another plot twist and it makes you more frustrated. The movie does it several times during the movie. I was eventually able to understand its plot but I didn't have as much fun trying to figure it out as I did with Nolan's other movies. Also, you have to suspend a lot of disbelief at the ending. I felt like it was done just for the sake of it in this case.

However, despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty good movie. It has great acting from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, great cinematography and lighting, and most of the film up to the end is thoroughly entertaining. It's really only the ending which truly upset me. So in conclusion, this is a nice film and all but I've personally seen better movies from Nolan.",5
14 February 2021,Great movie,"'The Prestige' is set in London in the early 20th century and revolves around the power play of two magicians. The movie lives from the fight between the main characters played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. However, it is not a natural rivalry in which they spur each other on to top performance. Nor is it primarily about being seen as a better magician by society. The focus is on the simple fact of wanting to be better than the other. And everything else in the lives of the two must submit to this situation.

It's really nice to see how this game keeps coming to a head and the limits of what is acceptable are pushed further and further. You never really know at what point who has the upper hand and in which direction the whole thing will go. The movie has a lot of smaller and bigger twists that are anything but predictable and lose impact even after watching it several times.

The character played by Michael Cane explains how a magic trick is constructed. It consists of three acts. In the first act, the magician shows something supposedly ordinary. In the second act, the magician manages to make the ordinary do something extraordinary. In the third act there is a twist and the spectator sees something shocking.

In the end, a trick is only interesting if you don't know how it works. This is exactly the point that makes you think and doesn't let you go.

This setup of a magic trick was incredibly well shifted to the level between the two main characters. Every segment of the two's fight works on this principle. The two shock each other over and over again with something that can't be expected or explained.

For me, 'The Prestige' works really well. I've seen the movie several times and it hasn't lost any of its impact for me. On the contrary, when you know where the story is going, you pay attention to other details.",9
29 September 2019,Must see this Christopher Nolan's film.,"Nolan has dropped the obsessive stage magicians fiction of back in 19C London an absolutely stunning way.

Exquisite supporting characters and props are delivering the fiction more believable. The Prestige shows the genius way to develop characters in a critical situation. The Prestige is the most entertaining but masterpiece of magician film of all time.

24 November 2006,Once: Excellent. Twice: Masterpiece. Thrice: All-Time Classic,"It's quite possible that THE PRESTIGE improves more with repeated viewings than any other movie ever made. As you might have gathered already, there are revelations at the end that force you to reinterpret everything you've already seen. The second time through, it's a different movie. Now, this trick has been pulled off before (most famously by THE SIXTH SENSE), but what makes THE PRESTIGE unique is that our identification with the characters changes once we know what was really going on, and the movie, which on first viewing is flawed only by a slight coldness, becomes profoundly emotional.

It's possible that Christopher Nolan (and his screen writing collaborator, brother Jonathan) will never top MEMENTO, because the concept of that movie is so original. But in every other way, THE PRESTIGE is a more accomplished film, and it's so good that it (and its predecessor) actually make an argument for Nolan being the best director since Kubrick. The screenplay takes a justly acclaimed World Fantasy Award-winning novel and, astonishingly, improves it greatly. The screen story seamlessly cuts between three separate time-lines (or four, if you consider the very beginning of the movie) so deftly that you may not even notice how ambitious such a structure is. Unlike MEMENTO, the structure doesn't call attention to itself, but like their earlier movie, it is integral to the story being told.

This is (the first time through) a hugely entertaining movie which (on subsequent viewings) turns out to be a deep meditation on obsession, on illusion, on sacrifice, on the nature of art and its audience. It's the best single movie of the last five years (exempting THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and, along with DONNIE DARKO, the best science-fiction or science-fantasy movie since BLADE RUNNER (and maybe since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY).",10
4 January 2020,If only it were a little less smug.,"An enchanting and distinctive tale which is most memorable in the scenes of charismatic characters refining their act.

It's tone of illusion and deception really can't be beat.

13 November 2007,Finely structured complexity,"Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie (as Nikola Tesla). Well you thought ""The Sixth Sense"" had twists and turns? Not compared to this one! It's the late 1800's. The next generation of stage magicians is coming  and they are VERY competitive. Two are near the top, and keep trying to out-do the other for top position. Then things get out of control. This is SO much fun, and the complexity is so finely structured, you finally just sit back and let yourself go for the ride. Think roller coaster that keeps shooting past the starting gate for another loop. ""The Prestige"" has a sub-story, and that is of the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose biography I recently read. You will enjoy knowing that ALL the inventions and events depicted for Tesla were TRUE  until you get to the final secret related to the top hats. That's all I'll say. This was an exhilarating cat-n-mouse-n-mouse-n-cat-n-mouse story.

16 March 2007,deeper and deeper (it should have won many Oscars),"At the beginning, this movie is like an anonymous box: you don't know what there's inside. So you open it, and what you find? Two boxes. Then you open those boxes, and find three more boxes. You go on opening and the only thing you find is more and more boxes. But, after all, aren't all the boxes part of the first one?

When you wake up in the morning, you look at yourself in the mirror in front of you. This movie adds another mirror, behind your back. And then the pictures of you in the mirror become more and more; you don't have to turn back. But, after all, aren't all the pictures showing just one face?

You've got a hundred-dollar bill in your wallet. This movie just turns it into five dollars'. Then into one's. And then into coins. But, after all, haven't you got one hundred dollars?

At the beginning this movie is simple, ordinary, like an anonymous box, like your picture in the mirror, like an hundred-dollar bill. But then the best of all the living directors, Christopher Nolan, adds one, then two, then three more little things, and everything becomes faster, darker, deeper. And at the end you can just clap your hands: after all, isn't it just a movie?",10
25 April 2007,Great movie with superb acting,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
18 August 2021,Deception .,"The movie goes from 0 to 1000 quickly and is amazing. You will not be able to understand a lot of plots but only if you keep yourself bound till end maybe you will get the answer to all your questions.

Came here for Nolan and Bale , literally I got them both as amazing as it could have gotten.

Things go up and down a lot like a lot , lot. Actors perform so perfectly that things seem too amazing to be true . By the end of the movie you will see it was nothing but deception that they were using.

21 April 2013,"""Are you watching closely?""","Welcome to the ultimate cine-magic trick! Encased in the late 1900's when ""mans' reach exceeds his imagination"" competing magicians enter into each others escalating tricks and entangled traps. But how willing are they to get their hands dirty and do they have the commitment that is required to pull off the trick? The films' darkness is appropriate as Christopher Nolan maximizes the story, while his cast and spins his seduced audience. It's difficult to not get reeled in by the storyline and we are even told the tricks, but the astonishment of the prestige still amazes! The film begins with the line,""Are you watching closely?"" and yet when it's all over you will need to ask yourself the question again and again!

9 March 2019,Are you looking closely?,"The Pristage is a great fantasy drama film, that keeps you engaged to the very end. Once you have finished the film, you will want to watch again immediately to see what clues you missed after the surprise ending. I love this unique and well made film. Nolan is such a great film maker. He always seems to cast the right actors for his films. This movie plays with your imagination and keeps you guessing towards the very end of the film. I think this is one of Nolan's underrated films, but it definitely does not disappoint.

16 December 2020,Very well made but predictable,"I found this movie very well acted, interesting story and characters, but at the same time I found it so predictable that in the end, what would have made it great, the ""twist"", was just a conclusion of what I've already noticed from very early. All the signs are there, maybe so clear in the open that is too obvious to be surprised by the end. Sure if you didn't notice, thinking back about the details will blow your mind, but I think it's too obvious what's going on. Still, I did want to know what was going to happen to the characters, so that part kept my interest to the end, but the twist was lost for me quite early. Anyways, it's a very good movie, very enjoyable.

18 December 2006,"THE PRESTIGE (Christopher Nolan, 2006) ***1/2","I've been interested in this period drama about the rivalry between a couple of magicians ever since I first heard about it, promising to be the kind of film they don't make 'em like anymore - it was that, and then some! Still, if there's one criticism I'd level at THE PRESTIGE, it's this: magic there is here but no poetry (the closest it comes is in the scene where the snow is 'lit' up and when Hugh Jackman stumbles upon the transported hats); having just rewatched Georges Franju's JUDEX (1963), I felt this most strongly - what it needed, perhaps, was a more evocative score (a' la Maurice Jarre's haunting theme for that film). Likewise, I somewhat regret the fact that the settings and the detail had to be so realistic - but I can see how this was vital to the psychology (which is, basically, what drives the plot in the first place!).

The film shows the essential fun of the craft but also the dedication it requires; the throat-cutting which goes on behind the scenes does seem a little far-fetched, even if propelled by a quest for vengeance (to say nothing of the extremity of the sacrifice to which the two men and those closest to them seem to be willing to go, or are made to, merely to feed their individual unhealthy obsession!) - except that the plot is so absorbing it's only after the film is over that one has time to ponder on such details!! Of course, the multiple revelations during its last act are astounding, if not a little confusing and somewhat too clever for their own good (it's ironical, too, that the two magicians end up 'dying' the same way as their respective spouses - but to reveal more would be unthinkable!): it certainly needs more than a single viewing for all the subtleties to be picked up and, while I'm not usually one to allow most recent films another look, this one is utterly fascinating and enjoyable...so I wouldn't have a problem with that (and, in any case, reading the HTF's ""Official Discussion Thread"" on THE PRESTIGE got me thinking about how much of it went over my head!).

The casting works better than I had anticipated: both Jackman and Christian Bale are their respective characters and they work off each other beautifully; Michael Caine and David Bowie, then, lend dignity to the proceedings with their knowing and underplayed roles. Still, while the contribution of the three women in their lives (Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo) isn't just decorative, only Hall as Bale's long-suffering wife is handed a truly meaty character; in fact, as was the case with THE BLACK DAHLIA (2006), Johannson serves mainly as a device to accentuate the power play being enacted between the two self-destructing male leads - but, then, such high-profile and noteworthy assignments can only increase her own prestige {sic} as an actress...

I've loved all of Nolan's films I've watched so far (I'm only left with his debut feature, FOLLOWING [1998], to catch up with) - but I can safely say that this one's the best (or, if you like, my favorite) of the lot.",8
1 June 2022,I defy you to not want to watch this at least twicw,"And likely almost immediately after the first viewing.... Incredible story telling. Keeping one guessing all the way through. Perhaps one of the most compelling twists ever - and not just the one. Beautifully acted by all especially Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.

12 August 2010,Trash,"After less than an hour I turned off this trash as could not fathom what was going on in the story.

It starts with a Dicken's era magician's act apparently going wrong and someone to blame and then a confusing and muddled plot which is dreary, fake and boring with equally mixed up flash backs etc.

All the characters are unpleasant and not likable in this film and speak with accents sounding like present day cockney.

The whole movie is unconvincing, silly and hence worthy only of the lowest mark possible.

What a load of rubbish: 1/10",1
8 March 2007,"Clever,maybe a bit too clever..","This was a movie that I had heard many good things about and I was looking forward to watching it. Did it live up to my expectations? If I am honest, I was slightly disappointed.

The movie is stylish and very well filmed and the acting is also mostly fine. Of the two leads, Hugh Jackman is definitely better and gives probably the best performance in the movie. On reflection, Christian Bale isn't that great and his accent really seems put on and not natural. Michael Caine is fine and Scarlett Johansson is mostly OK, though she doesn't always convince. There is also a nice little cameo from David Bowie. The effects are clever and the actual story is pretty good. So why wasn't I more blown away with this film? I think that the movie relies a great deal on the twist or twists and I could kind of see them coming a mile off and this certainly diminished some of the impact. I also felt that the movie was trying too be just a little too clever at the end, trying to fit in too many twists.I didn't get ALL of them but certainly the most important ones. Obviously,I won't even hint at the outcome and it is fun trying to work out the story before it reaches it's conclusion.

This is a movie worth watching but it may not live up to your expectations.",7

21 October 2006,Many twists and turns in this intelligent enjoyable film,"I can't wait to say that I loved this film! It was gripping, engaging, and surprised me a few times. I mean genuinely surprised me. The film is about rival stage magicians, rife with their lingo and culture, but more importantly, the film works much like a magic trick or illusion, offering its own misdirections while showing you everything. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both superb as the obsessed magicians. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo were very good as supporting female leads, though one of the best performances in the film was from Rebecca Hall. She made me want to look up her filmography. Michael Caine and the few others in immediate supporting roles were all good. I've heard mixed things about David Bowie's appearance in this film, but I think he was just fine; his appearance is more an extended cameo than anything else. The sets are authentic looking for the period, the writing is excellent, and even the music was excellent, if a bit subtle. The direction was superb, as was the editing. This is the rare film that gets everything right while telling a compelling story. It combines solid drama with an intriguing mystery and more than a hint of the fantastic I am hesitant to say anything about the plot, other than it concerns rival stage magicians in late nineteenth century London. Even the trailers for the film show precious little, probably for the same reason. Well worth the price of admission, I urge those interested to see it while its on the big screen.",10
1 July 2007,Classy and good!,"Basically this is just a very well made movie. It has both style and a good story, with some interesting twists and great actors in it.

What gets noticed first is how incredible good and style-full the movie is looking. The cinematography, costumes and make-up are all fine looking and provide the movie with a great atmosphere, that is also suiting for the time period the movie is set in.

But also the story is also fine and intriguing. At first sight the movie doesn't sound like anything too tense or spectacular; two rivaling illusionist who literally start to battle each other. However the movie does become tense and good as the story progresses. The whole way their rivalry gets portrayed in this movie is done so well, even when it starts to take extreme and obsessed forms. You also never really get to pick sides for any of the characters. At times you're for the one and against the other but eventually both characters have their good and likable sides and their evil and unsympathetic sides. You never love them but you also most certainly don't ever hate them.

And finally a movie again with a real good surprising ending! The movie does has some predictable tendencies but eventually the elements in the movie always end up differently then you expect them to, including the ending.

The movie does get unnecessarily hard to follow at times, which is due to the way of storytelling. You know, I hate it when movies use non-linear storytelling, just to look more smart. But with Christopher Nolan movie's this never really is a big issue, since he handles this always so well, with of course ""Memento"" as a perfectly executed example.

Not every story element in the movie works out. Especially the relationship elements in the movie shows some flaws and have some unused potential. It just doesn't seem to me that portraying and using romantic relationships in movies is really Nolan's thing.

Christian Bale was impressive as always. I love it how he always uses a different accent, though his way of acting always remains the same. But Hugh Jackman was also surprisingly great. I'm glad that he isn't being typecast since his first appearance as Wolverine in ""X-Men"". With this movie he once more shows that he also can handle far more 'heavier' and demanding roles. David Bowie surprisingly also shows up again in a good role. Guess it sounds weird but I really think David Bowie is one of my favorite actors. It was also fun to see Andy Serkis. Amazing, 5 years ago nobody would had ever thought about casting Andy Serkis in their movie, even though he has been active in the business since the early '90's. Amazing what playing Gollum did for his career.

Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson also have parts in the movie but their characters would had been just as good and interesting if they were being played by John and Jane Doe, though I like Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as actors and appreciate them being in this movie.

Even though the movie is tense and told in a difficult way, the movie also remains a perfectly entertaining one to watch. All of the magic tricks in the movie are done well and it also gives us a look in the way magicians worked and how tricks were created and executed. I also love how they kept the movie and its tricks also always as authentic as possible. It always looks like a magic trick and never like a computer effect or anything. Something that wasn't the case to that other and definitely also lesser illusionist movie ""The Illusionist"", also from 2006.

I wish there would be more movies like this.

8/10

26 February 2007,Magic behind the magic,"A great film!, 7 well earned stars for this movie; this is a little below the user's ranking, but in my personal standards is very high. I recommend deeply this movie; the way that you get involved with the tricks and the engineering behind some great magic shows makes you almost feel like a magician too; all the scenarios and cinematography is captivating, and the story keeps you at every single moment deeply involved with the film. Please watch the film and feel the magic behind the magic, the acting roles are performed excellent, the intensity of Angier and Borden is tense and captivating, and the involvement of Cutter with the tricks is great too, a magical film behind the magical tricks of the 19th century entertaining industry.

20 April 2023,Pure Magic,"The Prestige (2006) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a pair of young magicians and their mentor in the 1890s. As the world evolves and becomes more technologically advanced, so do their tricks. These tricks lead to tragedies in the two magicians lives leading them to become rivals. As they compete their entire lives become at risk as we wait to see who destroys whom first.

This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) and stars Christian Bale (American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Michael Caine (Batman Begins), Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings), David Bowie (The Labyrinth) and Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly).

The storyline for this picture is unique, unpredictable and contains fascinating characters and circumstances. Every cast member delivers a tremendous performance and the depiction of the era is perfect. The settings, props and attire are all well selected. There's also a dark feeling over the entire movie, which highlights the obsession evident in every scene. The magic tricks, and ""tricks"" behind them, were fascinating and fun to watch unfold. You can easily root for both sides of the duel. There's so many clever twists and turns and the ending is pure magic.

Overall, this movie is brilliant and an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10

13 April 2007,Expected to see a magic movie and I was blown away...,"I went into this movie and for the first quarter of the movie, it was near my expectation, then the story and where the characters go with their intentions and plans just totally blew me away. Great effects, great acting and a wonderful story that is about magic but also about the magic of science in the early years of the industrial revolution.

I don't want to provide any spoilers so I will say, this movie may come off as weird to some and genius to others, but all in all it was well told, well executed and the production is very good. Some of the ideas, notions and magic of science in this film. Top notch acting, great mixture of characters. You will like this movie if you liked movies similar to Requiem for a Dream, The Illusionist, Donnie Darko, The Fountain, and film in the like.

16 November 2006,Nolan not a one trick magician,"My goodness, Christopher Nolan is on a roll, after his stellar, mind-bending debut 'Momento' and his superb Batman Re-invention, Nolan has paused to show his versatility before embarking on The Batman Sequel 'The Dark Knight' to give us 'The Prestige'.

It's a dark,almost Shakespearian film about two Magicians, both friend's and rival's, who's passion for the performance of magic turns into a bitter obsession to outwit each other. This obsession becomes a dangerous cat and mouse game of intrigue, jealousy, after a tragic event, but what is illusion in this deadly game, and who is fooling who.

The first thing that must be commented on is the magnificent script by the Nolan brothers, complex and impeccably executed. Secondly A superb cast. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cain, Scarlett Johanisson, David Bowie, the cast does a magnificent job, particularly Bale and Jackman. Bale in an intense and cold performance, Jackman flawlessly switching from vulnerability to intensity with ease. It's also nice to see Ziggy Stardust himself working those acting chops in a welcome performance, playing against type.

I can't recommend this film enough. Intelligent, sophisticated, Hollywood film-making has returned.",10

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

12 April 2010,Nolan's masterpiece!,"Wow, I didn't see this one coming. It's been quite a while since I've been surprised by the quality of a movie like this. It kept me guessing and engrossed from beginning to end. The way that the narrative shifts back and forwards in time can be a little hard to follow on the initial viewing, but that's the only possible negative that I could ever think of, for The Prestige.

There have been many comparisons made between The Illusionist and The Prestige, and understandably so. They were released not very far apart. They both deal with magicians, and pushing the boundaries of what is considered illusion and what is considered real. Both of them have solid casts (though the absurdly excellent actors in The Prestige could easily be described by a stronger word than ""solid""), captivating stories, and twisting plots. But, while The Illusionist is merely great, this movie is basically flawless in my eyes. 

The story got better and better and better as it went on, topping itself again and again. The movie keeps improving with repeated viewings, as well. You'll pick up on clues that you probably completely missed the first time around. Needless to say, I was blown away by the ending. It bears repeating that at the actors and actresses are marvelous. I'm gushing, I know. You get it by now, I love this movie. Even after a few years and several viewings, I still enjoy every moment of it.

I LOVE THE PRESTIGE!",10
15 April 2007,"Great movie, a bit tense","As Hollywood made a habit of, we were presented with two magician movies in the same year. I really enjoyed The Illusionist, which was a very well done movie and in which the level of tension was high, but not enough to distraught my wife. But The Prestige goes over the edge. It presents the bitter rivalry between two magicians (and I mean BITTER). They hurt and humiliate each other and finally resort to murder. The wife couldn't handle it all, she said she can't bear to watch so much evil and childishness. Of course, she would have gobbled everything if it involved two women fighting for a man or any such nonsense :)

It is a movie about obsession. And sacrifice. Boys and their toys, gone really bad. The atmosphere is made even more weird by David Bowie, coming to enact Tesla, the scientist who is now regarded as a modern day wizard, and by Michael Caine, who plays the ""Engineur"" in other words, the tech guy.

Great movie, you should really try to watch it. Christian Bale gives a fantastic performance. Hugh Jackman was not so bad either.",8

2 April 2010,Christopher Nolan gives us another masterpiece,"""Are you watching closely?""

The Prestige is yet another mesmerizing film helmed by Christopher Nolan. A masterpiece in most respects, it sucks the audience in with its complex and riveting narrative and benefits from an amazing cast and fantastic production choices. So often movies which play like a puzzle don't hold up well upon repeat viewings, but The Prestige not only holds up, it flourishes. Every viewing reveals more of the impressive way Nolan foreshadows what's to come, giving the viewer everything they need without resorting to cheats. Every detail is thought out, every clue carefully placed. With its opening voice-over, Michael Caine informs the viewer exactly what the film will accomplish and how you will feel. It works as an epic tale of obsession and revenge, and it works as a magic trick all itself. But beneath the illusions and misdirection lies an impressively deep tale with a lot on its mind. Keep an eye out for a great performance by David Bowie as well as inspired turns by leads Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. As the film points out, ""You want to be fooled.""

This one will have you wanting to see it again as soon as it ends.",9
21 March 2007,Don't forget Rebecca Hall,"Not much to add to the comments about a film that will be remembered as an outstanding milestone in the careers of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Christopher Nolan. Except to note that Rebecca Hall turns in a heartbreaking performance as the loving, tragic Sarah, victim of her husband's obsession, despite his partial (not exactly the right word but what is) love for her. Her perceptive take on the secret defining her husband's twisted nature is the essential clue in the movie, though so subtly put that it's almost impossible to catch until that secret is revealed.

What a year for great movies! ""Illusionist"", ""Scarlet Veil"", ""Prestige"", ""Last King of Scotland"", ""Babel"", ""Scandal"", etc, etc...And even the flawed films like ""Good German"" had riveting performances. Film is back this year in a fantastic way and ""Prestige"" is one of the, if not the, best.

28 November 2006,The best film I have seen in ages,"Truly the most original and stylish film I have seen in many long months, The Prestige is simultaneously intriguing, shocking, dramatic and dark. It's so refreshing to see a film like this amidst the rest of the rubbish that Hollywood tends to churn out at this time of the year.

Beautifully shot, the film is visually stunning. The actors performances are all fantastic as well, and it's great to see Jackman in an unusually dark role - watching his obsession take over him slowly until he turns into a very unpleasant character was an interesting departure from his usual roles. Bale delivers a great performance as well.

I won't expand on the storyline as many here have already done that, suffice to say that although they deviated somewhat from the original books storyline, the films ending is nevertheless well-crafted and executed.

Definitely one to purchase for the DVD collection! A must-see.",10
15 March 2021,Christopher Nolan is the G.O.A.T of movie directing,"Christopher Nolan is definitely the best movie director ever. This movie confirmed it for me. He is a genius, and all of his movies are amazing and mindblowing (well except for the recent DC movies he had to direct, aka justice league and batman vs superman) I love interstellar, inception, tenet, batman begins, and the prestige. Can't wait to watch his other movies, memento, the other dark knight movies, and his upcoming movie reminiscence. this is on amazon prime, so if you have amazon prime, watch this ASAP

9 June 2007,life-ruining bad,"I hated this movie. I saw it in the theater and after it was over I just felt horrible. I was hungry but I didn't want to eat anything, I was tired but didn't want to sleep, I didn't want to talk to any of my friends, even my cigarette tasted bad. I ended up going home and washing dishes. Three or four hours later I snapped out of it but it was real downer.

It's not even like the movie was depressing, I like depressing movies, I like dark movies and sad movies and horror movies. But this was something different, it was life-ruining bad. And it wasn't even that any one aspect of the film was flawed specifically, (although I particularly hated the editing) just the entire movie turned me off. I don't know what I am supposed to leave this movie with, a lot of people keep saying that the entire film is a magic trick, which would make the film's director the magician. so in the end when he outsmarts me with his twist ending, I guess I am supposed to be amazed and astounded at how clever he is, and how not clever I am.

I don't know why anybody would want to see a film where the director is just flaunting his intellectual superiority over his audience.

The movie is like some awful prank, like director Chris Nolan took my car keys and through them in a river.",1
14 December 2006,"What can I say, wow!","What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to ""Usual Suspects"", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing.

13 August 2018,Abracadabra!,"The Prestige' tells the tale of two rival magicians at the turn of last century who constantly try to outdo each other at every turn. The premise may sound a little so-so, but, trust me, the finished product is anything but. It's magic. First of all it's a Christopher Nolan film - a writer/director who is one of the most respected and profitable working today. But, no matter how well he does in the director's chair, it's the cast who make it what it is.

I know that the term 'assemble cast' is normally associated with films like 'The Avengers' where every major character is a star in their own right, but 'The Prestige' isn't far off attaining this label. The two magicians in question are played by Christian 'Batman' Bale and Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman and, obviously, the film focuses in on them. However, there's plenty of extra acting talent supporting their personal grievances with each other, namely Michael Caine, David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall - all of which play their parts to perfection no matter how much screen time they're given.

It's really a story about obsession - how two men start off as friends, but, through a string of unfortunate events (and the desire never to share a stage and be 'the best' in their own rights!) they dedicate their lives to outdo each other, no matter how much it costs them. There's a fair amount of tragedy to the tale as both men suffer blows to their personal life in pursuit of their quests for revenge (and to introduce the perfect magic trick to their audiences) and you can't help but feel for them on more than one occasion.

I really would recommend 'The Prestige' to anyone wanting to watch a truly great modern classic. However, if I was to try and find a few flaws in it, I'd probably warn people that it's hardly fast-paced and quite long compared to the average ninety minute runtime. Plus the story does bounce around in time, meaning you'll see the end first and find yourself having the middle narrated by one character, before popping back to the beginning and finding a different member of the cast telling you what's happening. It does work, but it will force you to concentrate on what time period you're watching (check your phone at your peril and you may run the risk of becoming totally confused!).

However, perhaps my personal only gripe with the film was that all the way through I thought it was based in reality. The magicians are just that - tricksters like any other stage show act you'd see today. However, without straying into 'spoiler territory' I have to warn you that this film's genre ends up being 'science fiction.' But, if you know what you're watching you should really get quite a lot out of this film on many levels.",9
11 December 2018,"Magical, Mystical Tour - The Prestige","Such films as The Illusionist, Houdini and The King of Masks and others have all done excellent jobs with the subject of magic. The Prestige deserves to be right up there with those classics. I love magic and films about them, and I was not disappointed in this one. The King of Masks is my favorite all time magic film. This film comes close; the performances are impeccable, the direction is on the nose, and the production values are first-rate. The screenplay is erudite, and should be appreciated by the intelligent viewer. The really great magician in this film is neither of the leading actors, however. It is Tesla, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time; hounded by the heinous Thomas Edison, a person we were taught to revere in school. It is only now, in the information age, that we have found out what a despicable person Edison really was. There is no relation to reality and the Spencer Tracy film about Edison. He was a criminal. But the film is about magic, not criminal acts, or even Tesla (although we surely could use a good film about him). If you have even a passing interest or appreciation of good magic, then this film is for you. Enjoy.",7
14 June 2007,"A well written, entertaining and well acted film","When I first saw the DVD cover for this film I was immediately drawn to buying it due to a combination of factors; Christopher Nolan to me is a great director with Momento a piece of art as far as I am concerned. I also consider Batman Begins to be the best of all the Batman films so far, maybe even the best comic book film so far. Christian Bale I also consider to be a fine actor and almost all his performances so far (which I have seen) have been the best I have seen for his age.

I was not disappointed, my high expectations were met and at no point during the film did I become bored, the story moved along swiftly and the film did not rely on stereotypical portrayals of the period, Nolan actually made the period feel fresh.

Christian Bale as usual gives a stellar performance and Jackman holds his weight as the supporting lead. I was not entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as she seemed quite wooden (and pouts her way through the film) in a role that relied on her looks, a special mention should go to David Bowie who was excellent and will hopefully appear in more serious acting roles.

Overall greatly entertaining, not too confusing and deeply engaging.",10

22 February 2015,A Masterpiece,"Additionally to the great cast this movie is very exciting and shows many turns and twists. Christopher Nolan proved once more why he is one of the most wanted director of this time. I am not a fan of magic but this movie is less about magic then about showing how rivalry and the obsession to better than the other can destroy the people. The movie starts off exciting right away and it continues to hold the viewers attention. There is so many twist and changes through the entire movie and nevertheless the viewer never gets confused. This is definitely a movie that is fun to watch and that is definitely worth getting. Also with again world class performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. This is the perfect movie for having a quiet evening and still wanting to watch an exciting and agitating movie.

10 August 2008,Muddled Magic,"A couple of magicians develop a heated rivalry around the start of the 20th century in London. Nolan has a nice visual flair but can't elicit good performances from his big-name cast. The acting of Jackman and Bale, the latter sporting a bad English accent, may be kindly described as average. Caine fares better, although he seems to be still playing Batman's butler. Johansson is wasted in a negligible role. The script is so contrived, muddled, disjointed, and utterly ridiculous, and the characters are so poorly developed, that one doesn't care who wins the rivalry. It's a dull and long-winded story with an unsatisfying conclusion.

13 July 2020,"Ruined by endless plot holes, a telegraphed twist and overuse of flashbacks.","It cost 50m, so yes, it looks good and is well acted.

So the only question left is 'is it a good movie?' Well, in my opinion, no. Plot holes abound, some of the worst I've seen in any movie - and the impossible is repeatedly waved off as 'magic tricks'. This movie doesn't just demand that you to suspend disbelief, it asks you to forgive it for breaking it's own rules... every 10 minutes.

Most unforgivably, there's a use of 'back and forth' narrative, including flashback after flashback. It's one thing to confuse your audience unnecessarily to complicate the movie because the narrative in a chronological order would put viewers to sleep, but It's taking it to a whole new level to imply your paying customers are too dumb to understand the finished product by repeating ENTIRE SCENES OF DIALOG. My god.

But.. the plot twist you ask - well, considering they essentially give it partially away at the very beginning, again at the hour mark, and completely away at the hour 45 mark, there isn't one to speak of. The movie ends exactly as you would expect it, but you have to suffer through 20 minutes of further spoken exposition. It's genuinely bad.

Nolan might be a good director, but he's no magician on this one.",1

This movie is without a doubt something to remember, something to shock you and something to keep you wondering. Not only does this movie show you an amazing story it keeps you wondering what side to pick and it makes you change sides over and over. At the end who was wrong and who was right? You be the judge while watching this movie. Great actors, great story, beautiful and very detailed scenery, a bit of history, a bit of drama and everything else you'd desire from a movie. Enjoy this movie and be sure to recommend it.

26 August 2008,Mind-boggling philosophical exploration of illusion and real magic,"Intriguing, wondrous exploration of illusions and science/magic, with much to leave the viewer thinking for quite a while after the end. Beautifully done--writing, acting, directing, design--all transport us to a fictional previous time and place.

Very philosophical, yet enjoyable for those who just want to experience a good story.

I only wish I'd seen this in a theater instead of on DVD. If it is ever re-released, be sure to see it on the big screen. I will. This is one film that almost requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the nuances.

16 August 2021,Colossal failure,"A tedious film that goes nowhere. Unlikable characters, nonsensical plot, obscure motivation for the characters... I didn't care what happened to any of them. I was hoping the third act would at least be exciting. But it was just more nonsense and it ends with a total anticlimax. One of the most nonsensical things in the film is that it never explains why the two protagonists are obsessed with doing harm to one another. What is even more nonsensical is that while these two men are extremely intelligent and know each other very well, they never take necessary precautions to prevent the other from subverting them. It's laughable. At the end you are just glad you don't have to endure any more nonsense. I don't know how I endured watching this film. Positive reviews here are by people who are content to watch utter nonsense if it is well shot and has magic tricks thrown in. One thing I did like was Bowie as the genius Tesla. Shame it was only a minor role.

19 November 2006,The Prestige was interesting if maybe a little slow to wade through,"When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5.

11 December 2008,A Masterpiece in Contemporary Cinema,"I have no words, how much I liked this movie. In short, its one of the ten best among that released after 2000. But this is my conservative approach. Actually its among the all the time. The story was not a story. It was reflection of different human natures shown flawlessly through competition between two magicians - played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The movie has several twists backed by logical sense that kept the interest alive for 2 hour length. The ending blew me away. I was shocked when secret of Christian Bale revealed in the end. On the technical side, art direction and camera work was stand out. Locations were so real, one could actually feel. On side role, Scarlett Johansson confidently played Magician's helper. She is hauntingly beautiful. Her little presence was noticeable.

Director Christopher Nolan is the next big thing after Spielberg, Eastwood, Scorsese, Lucas and Allen. He has developed a new genre of cinema - Intelligence + Entertainment. I am not surprised by the fact his three films are in IMDb Top 250.",10
12 May 2017,A cinematic sleight-of-hand,"Easily taking the crown of best magician-based movie of 2006 - swamping the distinctly wonder-less and barely remembered The Illusionist - Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is a cinematic sleight-of-hand; an enigma of a movie that is both a puzzle-box of misdirection and an engrossing tale of two warring magicians. When I first saw Nolan's fifth feature (and his second working with his brother and occasional writing partner Jonathan), its 'big reveal' seemed obvious to me early on in the third act, so when the grand revelations came at the climax, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed. In the years since, The Prestige has emerged as a firm favourite amongst Nolanites, so I was eager to re-visit it without the added pressure of trying to navigate through the film's many smokes and mirrors. Without this on my back, I could only sit back and admire a true craftsman at work, even though the narrative pushes the boundaries of credibility.

In 1890s London, two apprentice magicians from two vastly different backgrounds work for Milton (real-life magician Ricky Jay), assisting in a nightly trick involving a glamorous assistant and a tank of water. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a handsome, charismatic American from a privileged background. Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, a rough Cockney and magic purist. While Angier knows how to get an audience excited and keep them entertained, Borden is a sullen stage presence, choosing to challenge his audience rather than dazzle them. The real brains behind it all is Cutter (Michael Caine), the craftsman and adviser who builds all the apparatus and devices required for the increasingly elaborate tricks. After a Milton performance goes fatally wrong, Angier and Borden begin a personal and professional rivalry that will play out over the years. They sabotage each other's shows, steal secrets, and try to perfect the ultimate magic trick: The Transported Man.

Cutter explains the three-step theory on what makes a great illusion. There's the pledge (the set-up), the turn (the moment that grabs the audience's attention), and the prestige (the pay-off, when whatever has been disappeared is brought back again). It's what separates a jaw-dropping, head-scratching moment from a cheap card trick, and is precisely what separates the The Prestige from The Illusionist. Nolan truly understands the mechanics behind the prestige, after all, he toyed with our expectations and our perception of time with Memento. He wraps The Prestige up in a cloak of mystery, employing time-jumps and subtle camera tricks to keep the audience constantly engaged in trying to piece everything together. Nearly everything is key to unlocking the film's secrets, even the seemingly routine sub-plots involving Borden's wife (played by Rebecca Hall) and glamorous new assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson struggling with an English accent).

The inclusion of David Bowie's Nikola Tesla and Angier's quest to convince the engineer and physicist to build him a machine required to pull off the ultimate trick may be a step too far for some viewers. Tesla's involvement stretches science into the supernatural, and clashes with the grounded world built up until this point. But Bowie is terrific, and the frequent presence of Thomas Edison's goons offers some historical context, as well as an allegory for the obsessive rivalry between the two central characters. Jackman is very good at switching between hero and anti- hero, his hands increasingly dirtied trying to outmanoeuvre his rival, and while Bale can add Borden to his list of grating accents, he wins our sympathies despite the coldest of demeanours. Caine, Nolan's go-to exposition tool, also provides reliable support as the fatherly voice of reason, However, the real stars are the brothers Nolan, who arguably lay all their cards on the table in the opening scenes, for anybody paying close attention. But pay attention or not, you'll be swept up either way",8
23 October 2006,Extremely interesting & intriguing movie,"This movie was simply fantastic and gets you thinking about it long after you have walked out of the theater. Not only was the story awesome, but the photography, acting etc was also great. Nolan has again played with the timeline while unraveling the story. ( ..as he had in Memento )

It begins with Bale reading a diary written by Jackman. Thats the present. The diary he reads sends us the past in which Jackman comes across the diary of Bale. That is the past. This diary which Jackman is reading sends us one level further into the past. All these 3 timelines run throughout the movie. As the story unfolds, it gets more and more interesting until finally we are hit with the climax , right in the present , offering all the answers to the mysteries of all the 3 timelines !!!! Just simply EXCELLENT !!! I give it 9/10 !

The performances were really great. I think Hugh Jackman has done a fantastic job. Bale is pretty good as well.",9
7 November 2019,Do you watching closely?,"Are you seeing closely? Nolan's consistent non-linear narrative and cross-cutting did not destroy the sense of substitution of Deadly Magic, and in the end it will never be able to see the clues buried by Nolan. Nolan's film also wants to challenge the audience's thinking like magic. What you see is notreal. Maybe you sometimes think that you have seen the truth, but you can't bear and imagine the price of success! Are you willing to make such a sacrifice? Are you really looking at it?

12 June 2009,This is a really good movie!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
4 March 2020,The Prestige pledges to turn a traditional magic show into an electrifying production.,"Obsession. Fixation. Passion. The manifestation of addiction. A state to which one is unable to control themselves for the betterment of their practice. Destroying the souls surrounding them. Self-destruction. The proclivity for supremacy can turn an innocent competition into a bitter rivalry. The war of the currents, Tesla versus Edison. A historic contention paralleling Nolan's fictional amateur magicians. Angier, The Great Danton. Borden, The Professor. Representing two social classes, the former aristocratic and the latter working class, as they mentally, emotionally and physically battle to become England's most renowned magician. Likening their mental capacity to chess players, each move they produce offers dividends and immolation.

Borden invents the raw yet spectacular ""The Transported Man"", which sees his own body enter one cupboard and exit another halfway across the stage within seconds. Angier, fixated on the secret behind the trick, utilises his showmanship to replicate Borden's ""magic"" in ""The New Transported Man"". But it's not enough. His insufficient adequacy overwhelms. ""Nobody cares about the man in the box"", he exclaims. And so, in typical Nolan fashion, The Prestige embarks on a merge with science-fiction, embracing ""exact science"" of the 1890s to produce the ultimate illusion. ""The New Transported Man"".

Whilst the third act is slightly modified in comparison to Priest's original novel, its thematic representation remains untouched. The idea that obsession controls the mind, hypnotising it into performing deadly actions with severe consequences. Borden and Angier's escalating rivalry embodies that inhumanity effortlessly, with perspectives of neutrality exemplifying dualism. Neither magician is portrayed to be good or bad. Whilst you may solidify an antagonist in your own mental prison, both are culpable individuals for the rising severity between them. Metaphorically expressing class warfare, Nolan never incited limitations for either entity. Angier with all his fortunes remained equal throughout to Borden, whom always ""got his hands dirty"". A strong illustration of practicality over methodology, supported by the exploration into the comparison between science and magic. Both, at the time, unexplainable.

However, the theme that provocatively entranced was the concept of ""the art of self-sacrifice"". Devoting one's life to an art form. An ambition. To tarnish marriages, to risk the lives of loved ones, to live for everything and nothing simultaneously. A reflective line mirroring selflessness and altruism. The two magicians assimilate this ideology in order to better each other. Borden, whose insistence on maintaining the secrecy of his greatest trick, damages his marriage to Sarah, allowing her to question their relationship. Olivia, stuck between Angier and Borden, acting as the human element to their inhumanity. Magically, their turbulent lives are transformed into tragedies, substantially enhancing the characterisation of all involved. Equipped with the nature of deceit, Nolan demonstrates empathy as the severity of their rivalry increases. You feel for them as humans. And that, is the greatest illusion The Prestige offers. Humanity with the inhuman.

Fortunately these thematic compositions are fully realised due to two enigmatic performances. Bale and Jackman, both garnering equal screen time, electrified the stages with a presence that demanded attention. Two extremely juxtaposing characters, yet interacting eloquently with a fierce inferno between them. Hall, Johansson and Caine attribute the much required human element to the story, with Bowie as Tesla providing stern wisdom.

The fragmentation of the narrative, which involves several diary entries, allows Nolan to execute his most intricate plot twist of all. The answer is always the simplest one, so to incorporate sleight of hand camera tricks to disguise the twist throughout, well, was genius. Pfister's cinematography gorgeously capturing the Victorian environment with earthly colours and darkened tones. Julyan's understated score and Bergen's authentic costumes were also noteworthy. The only minor criticism hidden within this illusory tale, is with Smith's editing within the third act. Occasionally frantic with scenes abruptly cut in order to resolve plot points, for example the identity of Lord Caldlow. A major contrast to the nuanced storytelling that preceded the twisty conclusion.

The Prestige is very much it's own magical trick. ""The Pledge"" illustrates a brooding rivalry between two aspirational magicians whilst embodying class warfare. ""The Turn"" takes an ordinary transportation trick and presents the extraordinary by merging science with magic. And ""The Prestige"" devotes all intentions to the tragic art of self-sacrifice. In the end, ""you want to be fooled"". The best magic shows always do.",9

2 November 2006,What a movie!!! Just Excellent,"Oh where do i begin! I knew this is a good movie. I knew it is gonna be tricky. So i watched tentatively from the start, and i just couldn't blink or exhale. This is one good movie and definitely worth the money to watch.

The story is unique, different and very interesting. Not only about magic and complicated tricks. It is also about the complex human emotions that are beautifully portrayed by a great cast. Acting form each individual was very convincing. There were few moments when camera movement was a little irritating and unstable, but all in all.. close to perfect.

In short, the movie is interesting and is like nothing i have seen before. It is definitely worth watching in the cinema... may be twice. And it is definitely worth buy the DVD. I hope they will make a presentable box set for this great movie.

24 January 2022,An entertaining semi sci-fi psychological thriller l!,"The film was directed by Christopher Nolan and all of his films never disappoint, his films always keeps the viewers thinking a lot and guessing the whole time, and his films are the kind of films that makes people want to go back and rewatch it because there is just so much complexity in the story and interesting themes/symbolism in it (and I like how he really tries to make the symbolism to be a little more obvious so it's easier for most to understand and not too complicated).

The film explores the field of magic/illusionist acts during the last decade of the 1800's. It is very interesting to explore this topic and it gets you more interested in magic performances during this time period and what people did for entertainment at the time. The story has a lot to do with revenge and one-upmanship between one guy who was a skilled illusionist, and the other who was a skilled showman and presenter. They both started their careers working on stage for a magic show manager who puts together the magic performances. One day during a live stage performance, it went terribly wrong and one of the guy's wife dies in the act (she also worked with them as a performer) which caused him to seek revenge on the other guy because he thought that guy was responsible... but upon seeking revenge, he gets very obsessed and goes great lengths to do it. But who will outsmart the other? You'll have to see the film.

Another great classic semi sci-fi thriller by Christopher Nolan (I said semi sci-fi because you'll later find out why when you watch the whole film). His films always keeps me thinking, even days after I finished watching the film. I makes me want to go back and rewatch the film so that I could better piece together the story and symbolisms/themes behind it. And it also has stellar actors that you'll probably recognize, during the period when they weren't super famous yet. After you finish watching the film, you'll want to go and read up more about the film to better understand it fully, and that's why I love Christopher Nolan's films. I am the biggest fan of his and think he's one of the greatest directors of our time (he directed the movies, 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' which are many people's favorite films, including mine).",9
1 January 2007,A Truly Intelligent and Gripping Piece of Art,"Over these last few years, I have been increasingly against the critics opinions on the quality of movies, whether it is on their criticism of blockbusters and lack of originality, or studio's greed for money on detriment of quality. These past year, i have to start to agree with them. That was until the Prestige came on. It has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that truly made me care about the characters and their motivations, and most importantly it has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that made me totally forget about the hectic life outside, and make me devout myself entirely without looking at my watch at least once. Obviously that isn't a coincidence, this only happens when true cinematic geniuses are behind the camera, either Christopher Nolan's passionate and intelligent direction and skillful writing adaptation capabilities, or Pfister's lighting and Julyan's score. That combined with a top-notch cast leading this peace of cinematic brilliance presented as a magic trick itself makes it a as enjoyable as possible. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman battle themselves character and acting-wise, because you never know which one has the advantage over the other, and to make the recipe perfect Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie support the duo not over shadowing them but composing a colorful and deep canvas. I guess what I like the most about the Prestige is the fact that the movie is about magicians composing magic tricks and the three steps to complete them; and the movie is actually presented to us audience in that way: You have The Pledge (Who the characters are, their motives and backgrounds), The Turn (you realize nothing is what it seems, twists keep on coming and you never know who has leverage) and The Prestige (the most interesting of them all, because you are given an explanation for the events, which explains all of its ""cientific impossibilities"") But are they really impossible. Were all the explanations given to you the reality?.....Did you watch it closely? Make sure you did. Because the explanation is not what it seems. That is the real Prestige of ""The Prestige"".",10
27 December 2020,Smoke and mirrors,"Magic and showmanship. Is it the craft that shines or the performance. The trick isn't has spectacular once you know the secret. A little bit of mystery can go a long way. Secrets and competition. Who's story is it anyway? I'm no stranger to the world of Christopher Nolan. This movie has been on my list for a long time. I wasn't let down. A lot of fun and thought provoking. Great watch.

26 October 2014,Good storytelling is the real trick,"The complex machinations and constant time shifting writer/director Christopher Nolan employs in 'The Prestige' could very easily have derailed the entire movie, leaving it an utterly confusing mess. Instead, Nolan masterfully weaves these threads together and crafts a tale of obsession, one-upsmanship and revenge that will hold you in its spell for its entire 130 minute runtime, and then send backtracking for the clues you missed.

The cast really shine here, inhabiting their characters and bringing them to three dimensional life. Bale and Jackman are terrific as the obsessed rivals at the center of the film, and supporting players Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine and Rebecca Hall are every bit their equal.

'The Prestige' is an intelligent, well-crafted tale. Not to be missed.

30 October 2006,Christopher Nolan's brilliant MAGIC act.,"""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" - Christopher Nolan.

The above quote is yet another example of a case of delicate and extraordinary screen writing. Guess what, this movie stands to its expectations raised in first few minutes. This is not just about magic but the life behind the acts. As Cutter (Michael Caine) narrates above quotes we see a magician performing on stage. A strange thing happens during his act (which of course I am not going to spoil) which takes you right to the core of what this story is all about. That opening scene creates a lot of questions. But interesting as it has been it makes you create your own theories. Its for you to find out what happens next.

This is a story about Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman)and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who are working as assistants for a magician Michael Caine. Every single act they watch of their own master and other magicians, they become curious about the acts and try and break those in their heads. As the story continues the situations arise when they rival against each other. That turns into a quest. A quest for the creation of the greatest magic act ever. All you have to do is just sit back and enjoy this unbelievable ride into the world of MAGIC.

First accolade for the movie goes to Christopher Nolan, who was my immediate favorite the day I watched ""Following"". He has an uncanny ability to present. He is a master story-teller. The movie has a lot of pace. Though I saw the twist an hour earlier but it rather made me look for an explanation and Nolan has one that fits right in. He gives yet another fantastic screenplay after Memento and Batman Begins. Non-linearly written, based on Jonathan Nolan's short story, this saga glues you to your seat.

The performances were fine. Especially Christian Bale. His acting gives this project a real life. This movie shows us his talent beyond the action scenes of Bruce Wayne' other half. Hugh Jackman wasn't far behind him. He delivers his performance with much intensity as well. Their rivalry keeps you guessing and thinking all the time. Next up is Michael Caine. He fits quite admirably in the character of Cutter. Singing legend David Bowie is memorable in his short performance as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning as usual.

This movie is dark, tricky, illusionary, intense and of course has something that I have never seen before. Applause to Mr Nolan.",10
30 July 2010,A Beautiful Lie,"The Prestige is one of the most well crafted movies I've ever seen and it kept me thinking the whole time. Once I thought I understood it, something else came along and changed that. This lasted throughout the whole film and it wasn't frustrating, but extremely intriguing. Pacing was really good and I never lost interest. The story was actually very interesting to me and nothing like I've seen before. The ideas were brilliant and gave the movie the character and spirit it had. Completely original and didn't take from anything else. The performances were great and totally fit with the ending. (You'll see what I mean when you watch) The movie was a magician's act itself, and I would love to see it more than once.

21 October 2006,Nolan delivers more than just smoke and mirrors,"It's now official in my book; Christopher Nolan is the Hitchcock of the twenty-first century. His films are often dark, psychological and mysterious and always intelligent and carefully planned out; he's a real pro of both direction and misdirection. From his early film, Following, to last summer's blockbuster hit, Batman Begins, his films also usually require some intelligence and maybe even a second viewing to put all the jig-saw piece together. His latest thriller, entitled The Prestige, is a combination of the gloomy cinematography of Batman Begins and the swift and often disorienting editing of Following. Yes, it's a thinker, and yes I'm sure some will easily confuse this film with The Illusionist, but these two films couldn't be anymore different. Where as The Illusionist was a romantic-mystery set in Vienna, The Prestige is a dark mystery-thriller set in Victorian era London. This is a darker, meaner and a much more emotionally colder film about two men's obsession with fame and greatness, and to what lengths they will desperately go to get it.

The Prestige is about two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Bowden, played marvelously by the charismatic Hugh Jackman and the slick and crafty Christian Bale. Angier is a magician with a real talent for wooing the audience with his razzle-dazzle tricks, and Bowden is the more talented of the two, but doesn't quite know how to engage the audience with his show stopping talents. They were once partners working with a magic stage producer named Cutter (played by the great Michael Caine), but when Angier's wife is accidentally killed in a magic trick gone wrong a strong rival and bitter hatred is born. Angier holds Alfred personally responsible for the accident, and then sets out to get his revenge by up-staging his competition with more dazzling tricks or simply just steal the ones he's already using, but just adding a little more pizazz to win over the crowds and ultimately get all the glory.

The rival gets more and more heated when Alfred pulls off an incredible trick that Angier just can't seem to figure out how to duplicate. To the best of his knowledge he tries to replicate the trick, but as he struggles to unravel the mystery behind it meets an obsessed scientist named Nikola Telsa (played very well by David Bowie, that's right David Bowie, how awesome was that!), who's experimenting with electricity. Remember this is the late nineteenth century, and to some that probably was a form of magic back then. As this rivalry gets more and more intense lives are shattered (along with limbs) and friendships are betrayed. The film bounces back and forth from the present time and the past (with the use of 0f flashbacks), which helps to keep the mystery masked until it's ready to be unveiled at the end. But unlike The Illusionist, this isn't a film that's solely a one-trick pony. The Prestige is twisting and turning from beginning to end, and never stops. Some things you might see coming, others you might not, but regardless, Nolan delivers the drama and the suspense to pull you into the film and carry you through it. I won't talk anymore about the film or its secrets; it's far too much fun to discover them for yourself and then talk to others who have seen it afterwards. I noticed a number of people in the theater stayed in their seats until the end credits discussing the film's ending and it's many surprises.

The reason I'm not giving this film a perfect ten is because sometimes it can get a bit too confusing, but I'm sure it'll make it even more fun to go back and watch it over and over again just like Memento. Also, emotionally it was a little tough to get into fully. The characters aren't quite fully black nor white; they're a shade of gray that's constantly drifting from the light to the dark. Jackman is especially impressive because of his charismatic charm (remember how likable Wolverine was? Yeah, me too.) and to see him slip into evil is actually kind of spooky. And what can I say about Christian Bale other than the fact that he's an amazing actor. If anyone is to be the ""hero"" of this tale I'd probably put my money on him. With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has given me one more reason why he's one of my favorite film directors working today, and so far his track record is flawless and his films are consistently intriguing and refreshingly original. This film is one of the smartest brain teasers of the year and I am certain The Prestige will make my top ten favorite movies of the year list. Now I can't wait for Nolan and his team to get to work on the sequel to Batman Begins; The Dark Knight. I'm sure that once again I'll be left stunned and thrilled.",10
3 March 2007,"great movie, dark story about an all consuming rivalry","""The Prestige"" is a movie by the same writers/director as ""Memento"" so I had great expectations and luckily I wasn't disappointed at all.

First of all it looks great, a lot of effort went into the details of the locations and costumes etc. It's very moody and the whole atmosphere of a late 1800's England fits just right. The acting is great too, all characters in the story are understandable and believable. Also, by introducing the historic character Nikola Tesla a certain it-could-be-true feeling is added to the movie (very entertaining performance by David Bowie by the way).

The movie covers a long time-span and shows many interesting locations, so in a way it's also an adventure movie. There are several twists but it's all integral to the storyline and not just some gimmick. As always with these kind of twists, a lot of people pat themselves on the back because they figured it all out right away (or so they claim). But for me the twist wasn't the biggest surprise in the end.

Instead, the amazement comes when you think about what the main characters must have been through all along, the sacrifice. At the end you suddenly look back and realize how their single-mindedness, their obsessiveness has gradually taken them to a very dark place. That's the part you'll keep thinking about after seeing it.

Great movie, highly recommended.",9

22 February 2007,This is what movie making is all about,"I have never, ever seen a movie this good in my entire life! The acting is fantastic, the story is 100% original, and the end blows you away! When I first saw the trailer for the movie I knew instantly it was going to be a good one. How many movies are there of magicians and stuff like that? I really enjoyed this film. This is the best movie I have seen Christian Bale in, and he really did an amazing job! Scarlett Johannson and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job also. The chemistry between the actors and characters was unbelievable! It kept the suspense going through the entire film making me think ""oh my god, what's going to happen? what is he going to do?"" and I love that in a movie! The ending, of course, was so cool! This is definitely ""movie making at its *very* best!"" If you haven't seen it yet, then watch it! You'll be astonished at how amazing this movie is! I don't understand why it didn't win every single Acadamy Award...Well, then again, critics don't know how to critique the right way so...oh well. Just watch the movie, OK? You'll love it! Guaranteed.

30 September 2007,"Dark, depressing, plodding, ponderous, and unbelievably dull","I much preferred 'The Illusionist', as that film at least had likable characters a viewer could hope would prevail, in the end. I've seen 'The Prestige' twice, now, and I think even less of it after the 2nd viewing than I did after the first. But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.

Others have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch. I have endured, rather than enjoyed.

The story itself is an interesting concept and the execution lacking. Magicians with a rivalry willing to do whatever it takes to best one another.

Which evaporated pretty quick. The two main characters are completely unlikeable, the plot is convoluted and so far-fetched. Even Michael Caine, who I am usually a fan of, was annoying. This was not a thriller but a pretentious borefest.

16 January 2007,Different,"A very different setting, a very different story of the art of magic and illusions makes the movie a classic. Bale and Jackman fight it out for the top spot in the theatrical worlds of magic and trickery. And they weave a spell of magic doing so. i was spellbound in the entire movie, drawn into making hypothesis of how each trick was being performed, and they managed to trick me every step of the way. Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen. The dialogs are good, performances great but what makes the flick stand apart from the rest is the imaginative storyline that made me sit the entire movie, moth agape. In the end, when the truth is revealed, one is left speechless. words don't do justice to the film. A must see for all. A slow movie, but that adds to the beauty of it. A definite 9/10.

21 May 2020,"""You're familiar with the phrase ""man's reach exceeds his grasp""? It's a lie: man's grasp exceeds his nerve."" 🎩","What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick. Abracadabra.

17 April 2021,Another Great Work By Christopher Nolan,"""Nolan's use The Prestige timeline like his incredible ""Memento"" which is risky for some of the people but gladly not for me, with the incredible perfomance by everybody, with a great double-twist that in the end make The Prestige is a totally make sense story, using double-twist that have been use before in ""The Usual Suspect"" which have a crime theme is i think easier to make, but for a movie that a have theme like this it's totally not easy and Nolan's makes that so well, overall The Prestige is just another great work by Christopher Nolan, i highly recommended""

8 December 2018,I feel cheated,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

15 February 2023,Prestigious,"The Prestige was simply an extremely well thought out and purposeful masterpiece. Nolan artfully put together the perfect cast with the perfect story line that ended in a very complex but exciting way. Both Bale and Jackman were tremendous throughout. The story line evolved throughout and had twists and turns you don't expect. The rivalry between the two men continues to grow and enhance and it proves to be deadly. I was thoroughly entertained throughout and liked this more than I expected to. My only drawback would be some of the dialogue and lines were difficult to understand or hear but that's mostly due to the time period in which this is set. Very good movie though.

19 November 2006,No-go,"Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...

And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times.

16 August 2020,They should have both died,"First things first; the acting is excellent by one and all, especially the great Michael Caine. The characters on the other hand were disgusting. The way these two behaved and the atrocities they committed made me wish they both died. The little girl should have been raised by Cutter. This movie made me sick to my stomach. Both characters were utterly demonic.

9 June 2008,Simply magical,"""The Prestige"" tells the story of a pair of magicians in turn of the century London. A bitter rivalry develops between the two and it seems that they will stop at nothing to top each other, perhaps even resorting to murder.

The story is a fine one; full of the film equivalent of slight of hand and with enough depth to make a second viewing as rewarding as the first. The film basically plays like one big magic trick though it has enough variety to keep things interesting throughout.

The stars, Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman, are convincing in their roles, bringing the magicians (and their explosive rivalry) to life. The supporting cast is pretty good as well, though there were no real standouts as far as I was concerned (except for the always notable Michael Caine).

Christopher Nolan added to an already impressive resume with his director's (and co-writer's) credit here. However, while his work here is accomplished, I remain of the opinion that his reputation is based more upon a shrewd choice in projects than a particular talent for direction.

Finally, given the subject matter, this film is bound to draw comparisons to ""The Illusionist"". While that film is pretty good, I believe that this film is superior in every way.",8
8 October 2007,Ending is worse than horrible,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINE SPOILERS Slowly paced thriller, that comes apart at the seams because of very lazy writing.

The filmmakers decided that the concept of being able to fool people a hundred years ago was not enough. They needed to create tricks that were so advanced and that relied on a science that is not even close to existing TODAY.

The entire resolution of the movie relies on turning the main characters into super magicians. They can now do things that are quite simply just magic. This is thrown into a movie that is supposed to be about two guys obsessing on how good the other guy might be in their chosen profession.

It is a lazy resolution to a high concept idea.

It is quite possibly the worst ending to a top flight production in the last twenty years. Why do this? Why create a machine that cannot possibly exist? Why not have something clever or smart be the reason for how these guys can perform the seemingly impossible, but instead resort to abra kadabra thats just the way it is? There is no way to get over this gigantic plot point, that leaves anyone with half a brain watching this movie feel like they have been completely cheated.",3
7 September 2008,interesting,"i came across this movie while while looking through shelves at the library.i overhead some woman talking about how great she thought it was so i thought i'd give it a try.

the film was a lot different than i thought it would be,but that doesn't mean i didn't like it.the story kept you confused right up until the end. the characters we're developed rather well and you could feel the tension in a number of different scenes.

i really wasn't expecting the movie to end the way it did,because,like a character thought,it was too easy.if you want a film that is entertaining with an original story-line and an allstar cast than look no further.the prestige is for you.

7 January 2011,The drowning of imagination,"Why Christopher Nolan's movies are so popular? Until you understand that, you will continue to wonder why people spend a lot of money and time to be imprisoned into dull and boring movies; Christopher Nolan knows exactly what he's doing, and he's known it from the start. And what's that he's got for you? A prefabricated universe dominated by figures with no soul and lungs: his audience likes the excitement of drowning their little imagination again and again; for them, films have to be that deadening and useless - and once they have watched them, they might say 'that was really good' a great many time before they get reanimated - lol! that is all right, because their understanding is so nimble to realize their error, which will be forgotten much more quickly than a dream.

28 January 2007,Best movie I've seen in a long time,"Depicting the story of two magicians, who develop a rivalry that eventually turns out into a true war, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that keeps you connected all throughout its two hours. Some people said about it that sometimes the action tends to be boring, but I consider exactly the opposite: I didn't have the time to get bored, due to the very well-written story. The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally ""strong"" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it. It's a film to savor and to feel (and eventually maybe to love)!

21 November 2006,magically spectacular,"I went to see the prestige expecting to see a good movie, what i didn't expect was to be totally blown away by what i think is the best movie I've seen in a long time. as a mater of fact its easily one of the top 5 movies I've seen in my life. The story telling is fantastic memorising you from the very instant to the end of the fantastic dark conclusion. it was great to see finally a movie of this calibre come onto the screen as im sure every one is sick of the rubbish that has been shown of late. obviously once again portions of the movie have been made to try and imitate or copy the powers of steve and steve's powers of the trevix. we must all realise that although many people have tried unsuccessfully, delving into the powers of trevix is dangerous and steve and steve's powers cannot be matched by anyone on this universe or any other... they are genuinely the super powers from the planet trevixon

3 August 2008,Highly overrated...,"As a fan of Christopher Nolan's work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I thought I would enjoy The Prestige as well. I was wrong. The good news is I just caught the film on Encore, so the only thing I wasted was my time.

I do not fault Mr. Nolan or any of the actors (save a lacking performance by Scarlett Johansson). The real problem here is the story. Without going into detail let me just say that the movie started with an interesting premise and devolved into a ""I'm better than you"" farce between the two main characters. I sat there in disbelief as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (both of whom I admire) were forced to lower themselves into a story like this. One of them wrongs the other somehow, and the other then returns the favor. This is Bale's most unfortunate film role choice since Reign of Fire.

Now don't get me wrong...as I said I do not fault the actors. Bale and Jackman performed as well as they could under the circumstances. However, since the story itself lost my interest, even the greatest actors in the world could not save it.",1

2 May 2007,Nolan hits (yet) another one out of the park,"No slump in sight for writer/director Christopher Nolan. He's now four for four, following up the solid efforts of ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"" with the equally fantastic ""The Prestige."" When's the last time a writer or director managed four consecutive films under their belt that were each fiercely distinctive and creatively successful? Nolan added further insult to the incompetent and lazy of Hollywood by actually improving upon the source novel. The eye-rolling one experienced while reading Christopher Priest's prose became gasps while watching Nolan's skilled adaptation. Nolan not only ""fixed"" Priest's novel, but turned it up to 11, conceptually. Good direction and especially good writing are invisible -- people expect a competent job. Only the truly great and truly terrible stick out. Nolan's accomplished something truly great on both levels. Superb actors (especially one bit of stunt-casting comes as a wonderful surprise; usually these types of cameos detract from a picture but Nolan's steady hand delivered), lush production design and careful attention to the thematic bedrock make for a contemporary classic. The only shortcoming, which is minor, might be the show's abrupt cutting around during the first act, which could seem a bit confusing. The unique layered non-linear continuity (diary-within-diary-within-story, etc) works flawlessly when Nolan's taking his time. Keep the film's curious first image in mind while the narrative untangles and keep your mind open when things turn toward steampunk. And you fanboys who were miffed because Nolan ""wasted time"" on this feature between Batman blockbusters should rejoice. The guy has more than enough juice for the Dark Knight.",10

10 March 2022,Probably My Favourite Nolan Film,"I think this may be my favourite Christopher Nolan film; if it's objectively best one is moot. I love the plot's perfect, crystalline construction. I love the counter-intuitive way it gains in power with each re-watch. First time around you tend to assume that now you know what's really going on, there's no point in revisiting. Instead you discover that watching it with an awareness of all this, of what's truly at stake, elevates the film from an intriguing mystery to a film of genuine emotional and thematic power. We're left increasingly gripped and increasingly uneasy each time; maybe, as we gain understanding, we could call it a horror film of sorts. Not one that scares conventionally, but that certainly leaves us with increasingly chilling reflections on humanity - but all whilst being endlessly gripped and entertained.

5 August 2007,Are you watching closely?,"Olivia Wenscombe: It won't bring your wife back. Robert Angier: I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.

Christian Bale (The Machinist, Batman begins) was absolutely stunning in the tale of two magicians who are constantly trying to outdo each other. X-man Hugh Jacman was his rival, who ostensibly wanted revenge for the death of his wife, but who was really more interested in being number one.

The is the basic story, but it is what is going on beneath that that makes this a superior film. While you are watching the rivalry, the magicians are preparing a trick that will amaze and astonish you. You know it has to be a trick, but they pull it off anyway, and that is what makes this film.

The outstanding camera work was by Wally Pfister, who did Batman Begins, and who will be doing The Dark Knight. The superb direction was by Christopher Nolan, who also did the two mentioned films.

23 October 2012,"Christopher Nolan, trick director","I didn't remember who was the director of The Prestige when I finally decided to watch it. So this is not a matter of prejudice, but when the credits eventually rolled I was relieved both because I found it overlong and protracted and because I was now definitely able to put a word on why I don't like Christopher Nolan as a director.

Let me start at the beginning. I just start to watch The Prestige as an honest viewer. I am not that found of magic shows but this sounded like a nice story. Actually I remember it's IMDb ranking and the presence of Michael Caine who put the movie on my backlog of recent flicks I might enjoy. Early on the storyline fluctuates between various times: past, past-perfect, present. It's OK, but it really doesn't help the movie build up ""emotional momentum"". The story never trusts continuity so we are demanded to always switch our attention on episodes that explain the whole story one anecdote at a time.

PLOT OBSESSION Most viewers seem to like this very authoritative way of telling the story. They are told what to watch, what to understand little by little and it's all about the plot, the plot, the plot. Characters are mere props. In the Prestige I realised Hugh Jackman is only an average actor. I agree the part is not the greatest but he really doesn't shine. As for Christian Bale I already knew he was a big ham who thinks he's good, dead serious while trying too hard to display his actor's studio abilities. Both actors are boring at best in the course of this story, and Christian Bale as the most boring part of all.

Well it's a fact that the lead illusionists are mean and inhuman characters. The chopped up narration only makes it more about their sick minds than their wounded souls. Fortunately there are a few nice characters here. Michael Caine adds humanity and presence to a simple part, and the feminine characters also help the movie rises up from its plot obsession. The production values help too, when the nicest characters aren't there.

Christopher Nolan is only too happy to have his plot tick like a clockwork, but eventually he is only a trick director in the same way as Agatha Christie was a trick writer. Characters don't matter, they're here to do the trick. Memento was a one-trick movie. Batman begins and The Prestige are very similar with their trick-filled characters immobile while the whole movie revolves around them in a big spinning trick. And Inception is a trick in a trick in a trick. Characters start as tricksters and they soon vanish behind the tricks layer.

To me that is the opposite of cinema: the trick is the show while it should be the illusion that it creates. Weird since this is the main lesson, clearly enunciated, in The Prestige: ""There is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art."" (R. L. Stevenson)",5

21 October 2006,"Good acting, poor production","I'll keep this short and to the point: The Prestige is an interesting story with pretty decent acting, but could have been much better were a little more thought put into post-production. Both Bale and Jackman played their parts quite well, but the flip-flopping of scenes between past and present were ambiguous at best and nearly every twist was foreseeable (if not obvious) long before it was discovered by the characters. For a movie about two magicians I would've expected the ending to reveal a secret I wasn't anticipating the entire second half, which for obvious reasons made the last hour drag on waiting for the inevitable. In short, wait for the DVD. It certainly isn't worth paying $10 at the theater, for the acting is decent but not outstanding, the magic marginal, and the eventual revealing fairly obvious. It is less a matter of ""who and how"" and more a matter of ""when"" they'll finally tell you what you've suspected since the first 45 minutes.

22 August 2021,Are You Watching Closely vs Obsession,"THE PRESTIGE begins like a usual revenge story going to be end up on one's win over another.

But as the story progressed the movie kept surprising the viewers.

Like a magic trick, Everything was normal until the dissappeared object reappeared from nowhere.

It seemed like a ordinary movie till the extraordinary Climax Twist exploded.

Take a Close Watch to get cleared on progression.

The movie took a flight like revenge as the take off to obsession to destroy the career of the opposition to a Sky diving experience Climax portion.

It contains animosity in human caused by obsessions and protecting one's prestige to any extent.

I'm sure, the only part which reduced the love for the film for some viewers was Sci Fi element. But it was a much needed element for the incoming wonder.

And moreover it showed the non-popular battle between two wizards Edison and Tesla.

Every NOLAN film contains any human emotion as a base of the script.

Here it is obsession and prestige causing to sacrifices.

The movie is filled with 3 timeliness and changes the point of view if I'm not wrong.

The screenplay of THE PRESTIGE is one of the best in nolan movies if not the best.

So does the captivating cinematography owes appreciation too.

The best thing for me was art direction which is really under-appreciated. There was numerous props used for magic tricks and the stage setup for the shows.

Atmosphere created felt like it was happening on early 20th century.

I'm not gonna talk about Nolan I'm an ardent fan of him.

Next the main thing performances : Ah The Christian Bale as Alfred Bordon I don't know how he played such a complex character without showing the complexity outside.

It felt like a magician keeping his secret inside.

Such a Legend I'm already a fan of him after watching American Psycho and The Mechinist.

And then there is Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier Mostly the story was going through his POV And he does his job well.. Be it obsessed face, be it the animosity inside to destroy his only opponent.

The dialogue delivery of him was neat.

The movie doesn't take one's side so we won't sympathise with none makes the story better.

And Michael Caine as John Cutter.

It was nice to hear that he call Bale as Alfred, haha.

The Prestige is the apt title for the film.

It will make you think about the movie after watching. I got amazed by the sacrifice of Alfred and ______ to be the Professor.

Take a Watch it won't fail you.

That's it A CHRISTOPHER NOLAN MOVIE.",9
5 July 2022,Cool and Creative - another great obsessed artist,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

28 August 2012,"excellent movie,must watch","this has has to one the best movies ever if not the best..Christopher Nolan is a genius..there is no flaw in the movie..the direction is excellent..Christian bale and Hugh Jackman have put in Oscar winning performances..the plot is mind blowing.. the movie is centered around two magicians with a contrast idea of what magic is and the two are driven by intense rivalry towards each other..each tries to outdo the other and even try to sabotage each others performance..in the end one becomes obsessed to learn the secret of the other's trick and he is willing to risk everything to obtain it.. the movie is filled with twists and binds the viewer.. all i can say is its a must watch..

24 October 2006,Austin Movie Show review (brilliant and surprising!),"I see A LOT of movies, and very few big Hollywood studio-produced movies surprise me anymore. I can see the cheap, predictable, and formulaic story lines and twist endings a mile away. ""The Prestige"" is not one of those movies. Like a bad magician attempting to perform the bullet trick, I was blown away!

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are devious feuding magicians, living in turn-of-the-century London (not to be confused with another movie about a magician living in turn-of-the-century Europe, which was, honestly, crap). Jackman and Bale start off as partners, working in the same magic act. But when Bale accidentally kills Jackman's wife in a blotched magic trick, the two spend the rest of their lives trying to destroy one another.

Every twist in the plot is more mind-blowing than the one before, and the ending is nothing short of spectacular. ""The Prestige"" may not leave you believing in magic, but it left me believing in movie magic, and I haven't felt that in a long time.",9

10 April 2007,Sci-fi as a deus ex machina?,"I was told by several people things like ""This movie is awesome!"" and ""you'll have to watch it like three times to figure out what happened!"" Well, I can pretty comfortably state that the movie is not ""awesome"" and it only took about 1/2 the movie to figure out what was going to happen. I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true). If you do watch it, and I don't advise against it because it's a better alternative than a lot of other movies, don't be surprised if you come away shocked not at the ending but at the way it comes about. For in this movie, I'm not blown away by the twist but rather by the ludicrous yet horribly predictable road leading to it.

26 August 2007,Frightening about human nature,"This film is powerful, moving, and shocking. It shows what happens when people are suffering, and do not know how to handle their suffering in ways that do not hurt others. What begins as a friendship, then becomes a competition, eventually turns into a maddening and psychotic race to defeat another person and to destroy the other person's entire existence. In doing so, it dehumanizes everyone involved, and is frightening in terms of what it says about our inability to contain our pain. Saul Bellow once said something to the effect that an honorable man is one who does not pass his hurts along to others. These people fail to be honorable, with tragic results. And yet, they are not evil.

The storyline, setting, and acting are all superb. David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla is masterful casting. This may be the only filming of this brilliant man, someone who changed civilization, yet was the participant in his own self-destructive competition with someone less talented who we all know, although only because he won the ""competition,"" not because he was more talented or important.

This movie, like few others, stays with you. Months after seeing it, I still am affected by it. Ignore the critics. See it.",9
22 February 2007,Very Disappointing,"Hugely disappointing effort here. I was expecting better from Nolan, after the great ""Batman Begins"", but this was a real letdown. The story is disjointed and confusing in that it keeps jumping back and forth in time so much that you lose the time line, and it all gets muddled. You're not sure what is taking place when. The dialogue is lacking and the direction is not nearly as inspired as I'd hoped. Christian Bale is more effective playing Americans than Brits somehow, and his Cockney accent is not very convincing. Jackman is underwhelming. The major secret of the film is so absurd and deflating that I felt cheated as the credits popped up. If you want to see a ""Turn of the Century Magic Movie"", rent ""The Illusionist"" a much more elegant film, and although it relies more on the supernatural and the suspension of disbelief, it is far less ridiculous and contrived than this dung heap.

14 April 2007,It makes you think...,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that makes you stop and think. A movie that shocks you, surprises you, and for 2 hours, takes you n the ride of your life. The Prestige is one of those few movies that have ever pulled it off.

It was a surprisingly easy movie to follow, considering how often they jump around in time. The script was beautifully written, and the actors were excellent. Of course, you would expect that when you put Michael Caine, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman in a movie together. The plot was also very strong, and leaves you second guessing everything you saw at the very end of the movie. You could discuss this movie for days and still not figure everything out.

This is a movie you most defidently do NOT want to miss.

26 January 2020,"If anything can happen, then nothing happens","Two magicians really don't each like other.

Possibly there's an interesting obsession/revenge film in that plot outline somewhere, but not in this shockingly over-rated bore-fest.

Someone once said, 'if anything can happen, then nothing happens'. It's boring. Having no limits isn't liberating - it's dull. Throwing a gazillion twists, having characters radically alter their personalities on a whim, death, suicide, betrayal yadda yadda!

Less is more. Unless you're Christopher Nolan - in which case, just chuck absolutely everything you can think of at the screen and hope some of it sticks. Newsflash - it doesn't. Throw in some of the worst British accents this side of Dick van Dyke and hey presto - you've got the Prestige. IMDB top 250?! oh please.

2 stars - 1 each for David Bowie and Michael Caine, both of whom somehow got roped into acting in this turkey.",2
4 March 2022,Christopher Nolan playing with time,"It will take time to build the plot but latter half is absolutely twist centric and thriller.

5 October 2022,Amazing,"I absolutley adored this film. Nolan is my personal favourite director because I am extremley intruiged in the themes that are featured in them, for example some are very psychological and action packed, I am always thinking and never bored which is something I always appreciate in his films.

The storyline of this film i thorougly enjoyed, I loved the concept of the two opposing magicians fighting for power and dominace over one another and just watching them slowly decent into madness, being consumed by outdoing eachother and knowing eachothers secrets. I highly reccomed to anyone who loves a thrilling watch!

21 February 2023,A Real Amusement,"""The Prestige"" is a 2006 American psychological thriller film directed and written by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Scarlett Johansson and is about the competition between two stage magicians in late-nineteenth-century London, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). The narrative is portrayed in flashbacks as the two men strive to outdo one other with more deadly and complex pranks, culminating in a dramatic final showdown.

The film delves on issues such as obsession, duplicity, and the sacrifices one is ready to make in order to achieve success. The film also explores the concept of ""prestige,"" or the closing act of a magic show that leaves the audience speechless, and the lengths one is prepared to go to obtain it.

""The Prestige"" was a critical and economic triumph, and it received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. The storyline, cast performances, and directing of the film were all highly praised.

The performance was fantastic, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who were brilliant in the picture; the film embraces the end-of-the-nineteenth-century period, and it is a terrific film.

David Julyan composed the film's soundtrack, which was commended for its ability to complement the tale and express the passion and emotion of the film's story. Classical music is also included throughout the film, including ""Nimrod"" from Elgar's Enigma Variations and ""The Hall of the Mountain King"" from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt.

Ultimately, ""The Prestige"" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking thriller that delves into the obsession, deception, and sacrifices that are necessary for success in the realm of stage magic. Its outstanding performances, brilliant directing, and use of music make it a must-see picture. The sophisticated narrative of the film, with several twists and turns, will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end.",9

28 December 2006,"sensational script, good acting, marvelous job","one of the best movies of 2006. I saw the movie in a business activity, and god knows I thought ""another time-wasting movie, what the hell I'm doing here, why am i not in my bed instead of being here?"". But i was wrong. from the first scenes, I was in the story. director is also very good at taking the audience wherever he wants them to be.

The cast was very elite. Sir Michael Caine, as one of my favorites on all times, is doing a great job as Cutter ( as usual ). Hugh Jackman and Christian bale are the best actors for the roles as two ""competitor to wherever it goes"" magicians.

The story is also astonishing, seeing Tesla on the script makes me wonder, ""what the hell's going around, why Hollywood is talking about Tesla, the genius? someone's gonna tell the world about some wonders, which Tesla invented in recent years?"" at last, I saw thousands of movie, I can understand what the hell is going on in a movie by watching it 5 minutes ( this is Hollywood's and the movie company^s bloody sin in the movie industry. making nonsense for idiots, or a few dollars more...) . This movie is absolutely not one of those cliché Hollywood produced movie!s.

22 November 2018,Epic Tale About Tricksters,"I am not the biggest fan of Nolan's works (some are good but imho some are pretty overrated/praised like Dunkirk and Interstellar), but this one is (like Inception) a really nice gem with an unusual story.

A unique plot woven around two obsessed and rival magicians/illusionists with an amazing cast - Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine. And on top we get a nice painting of the times around the end of the Nineteenth Century.

Good and entertaining.

21 August 2021,The Prestige,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy) cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist. The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession, revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can sometimes be used as tools for deceit. What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience, somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be detrimental to any leaks of secrets. And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn between the rivals added a little gravitas. The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian scientist! I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in, without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours, you don't feel its length at all. At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection - what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none other. P. S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's movies?",10
31 December 2021,Magical but gritty,"A very good tale of magic and mayhem. Suspense is good, as are the performances and I really liked the dark, grittiness of this even though it was a ""magic"" story.

25 March 2020,OMG! Amazing,"I've never been so much confused after watching any movie. This is the best one. After ending I tried to arrange & relate those twists one after another. Moreover I have go through & repeat some scenes for 5-10 times. But I became more hanged! What was the truth? Who was true? It's all about magic? The Prestige? or The Science? Tesla's magic box? How was that possible to create a duplicate copy of everything! It might be better not to ask this question for such a movie! However as a movie it entertained & coufused me at best! Love it and of course I'll watch it again.

22 October 2006,I'm surprised yet not at all shocked ...,"At the professional critical reviews that ""The Prestiege"" has been garnering. To claim that The Nolan Brothers have under-written or half-directed this movie, or that ANY of the players on screen gave less than stellar performances is as great an injustice as walking out on the film halfway through or before it's wonderful climax. In fact, I'm convinced that some of the critics may HAVE done just that!! Sure, some of the ""twists"" are a bit predictable for the above average cinema sleuth, but overall, there is a very clear dichotomy between the audiences in the film watching the ""magic"" on stage wanting to believe it is real, and the audience in the theaters watching this film and wanting to believe that the magic ISN'T real.

This film is easily the best I've seen this calendar year, and The Nolans are quickly rising to the upper eschelon of my favorite filmmakers. Again, wonderful, layered performances from all of the involved cast, and beautiful set design and cinematography all around. If you're a fan of any of the above, or haven't seen a great mystery/suspense thriller with twists and turns that simply IMPLORE you to stuff more popcorn in your mouth to stave off the anticipation of ""how did they do that!?"" then this is a SURE BET for you.",10
5 July 2011,Yeah... I'm thrilled again,"It happens with every Nolan movie. The guy can't do anything wrong. Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most. They're great(did I say great like 3 times?) Special effects are good I guess. Well it's not Dark Knight nor Inception there aren't so much but those which are there are great. So yeah there you have it. Another masterpiece by Nolan.

7 February 2007,Abacadabra - no bunny from the high hat,"At the end of the 19th century two helpers to an illusionist are good friends. One of them married to a third help. They pick up the tricks from their master and things go well. Until a sudden event changes things in a big way. The friendship turns sour and they go their own separate ways.

The rest of the film is that tale - what happens after they split up. Played out in various time splits, going backward and forward through time at will. It isn't hard to follow, and the changing of time works as a positive - it keeps the story more interesting. It gives a good insight into why everyone is the way they are and why they do the things they do.

The story is believable, even in the time it is set in, apart from one thing. And quite frankly it was that one thing that more or less turned me against the film, but not too bad. It was still very enjoyable. Some of the things it touches on are actual history and that is very funny to see.

All in all. Rather enjoyable, a nice way to spend an evening. Nicely filmed, nicely played out, great musical score.

16 February 2014,Obsessive,"Film critic Roger Ebert described it as ""quite a movie — atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.""-Wikipedia. So true... I honestly can't recall how many times I have watched this movie, its just that good. I never get bored of watching this film no matter which kind of mood it finds me in. This film should serve as an inspiration for future filmmakers who wish to make intelligent movies that can keep the audience entertained as well as thought provoking. This movie is great in so many ways that I felt I had an obligation to express my feelings towards it. The acting is great, the directing is splendid, but what really made this movie awesome was it's script. Hats off to the Nolan brothers for bringing us another masterpiece. P.S This review was long overdue..

23 July 2021,"Good movie, got a bit crazy towards the end","It was a bit slow at the beginning, but as you understand how the story of the movie is presented you start to get into it and it kept me intrigued till the end. There was plenty of action in the movie with the magic tricks and violence which made the movie more entertaining. The movie has a bit too many plot twists, especially at the end for my liking, but I understand what Nolan was trying to do, as it's not your typical cliche movie ending which makes it more satisfying for the audience. Overall it's a good movie, but I would've liked it more if it had less plot twists.

29 October 2006,"Creative, intelligent, well-written and top-notch acting","The movie follows two competing magicians through their careers, as they each try to upstage the other and as their rivalry escalates. In the fighting, they both loose things dear to them, and each loss is more brutal, right to the very end.

The movie was very well written, well directed and the acting was top-notch. Christian Bale plays a magician who is extremely talented when it comes to magic, but not so much when it comes to showmanship. His rival, played by Hugh Jackman, easily surpasses him in that area and catches the eye of the crowd far better. Bale, upset at being the better magician but not seen as such grows bitter and wants what Jackman has.

At the same time, Jackman envies what he sees in Bale - his talent, and his tricks and he becomes obsessed with trying to figure them out, namely his most impressive trick, the Transported Man. Jackman comes up with his own version of it, aided with a machine built by Mr. Tesla himself (played by David Bowie of all people, and with surprising accuracy).

However, the trick isn't quite what it seems. Really, really, really not what it seems.

As a matter of fact, neither is Bale's trick what it seems. Nor is his family life.

It all builds up right to the end, with very well placed twists, and the last one the most shocking of all.

It's good. Go see it. You'll like it.",10
21 October 2006,Only good if you don't figure out what is going on,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

18 October 2010,Worth watching closely,"This movie is not for everybody; it is an exquisite mix of flashbacks and developments, more complex than Memento, but some viewers will find it confusing, complicated, or will see plot holes over the first half of the movie. The jumps in the time line are not an obstacle to character development, but help them as back stories; I got acquainted to the characters in The Prestige and actually cared about their struggles, their successes, and the deaths. Acting was very good overall, the environment was good and I felt in the 19th century. This is a recommended movie for intelligent people, ready to accept the twists and the moments of confusion in the midst of the story.

5 March 2007,A Breathtaking Tale of Obsession and Deceit...,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are extraordinary in this mind-bending fantasy thriller. I couldn't get enough of the movie and it's true - you immediately want to watch it a second time. Well directed and written, spectacularly acted by the whole cast and it keeps you guessing even after the credits finish rolling.

If that isn't enough, the cinematography and art direction were wonderful. There's a real ""magic"" feel to the film and a surreal sense of wonderland. Who is the true protagonist? Antagonist? What is real and what is illusion? This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch and decide for yourself. It's worth it.

10 November 2006,Don't miss this intelligent entertaining film!,"Christopher Nolan may be the best young director in Hollywood. ""The Prestige"" is not nearly as challenging as ""Memento"" but is more intelligent than the average fare. You don't need a PHD to get it. Nolan has now made enough films that we can begin psychoanalyzing him. He seems to be attracted to stories that include obsession, revenge and deceit (self and otherwise.) All of these elements are crucial to the plots of ""The Prestige"", ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins."" The ending is a bit ambiguous but this is the world of magic where nothing is apparent. It's hard to take sides in this film. There is ruthless conflict between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's characters but neither is completely the hero nor the villain. Some of the 'trick' plot devices are a little obvious but it does not spoil the film. It's a fairly visual film and much better than the standard muck so I recommend seeing it in the theater if possible.

23 November 2006,A highly entertaining film with dozens of twists and turns.,"The Prestige tells the story of two magicians, Angier and Borden, who start off working together under another magician. When Borden accidentally (or perhaps purposely) causes the death of Angier's wife, the two go their own separate ways, each becoming famous. A bitter rivalry begins, with each one sabotaging the other, until Borden invents a trick that Angier simply must duplicate, and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secrets of the trick. This is all I can tell you, because this movie is so filled with twists and turns, that I can't say much else without giving something away.

This is Oscar material for sure. In my eyes, The Departed is the best movie of 2006, but this movie is definitely up there. It has an amazing story with twists and turns all throughout. There is not one point in the film where you're not trying to put together some new plot twist. At the end of the movie, when the main twist is revealed, I guarantee that you will have a smile on your face. Christopher Nolan's direction style is very good with this type of movie. Even daylight scenes manage to look dark and foreboding. There really aren't many flaws in this movie. It pulls off being a serious movie as well as a popcorn flick.

The acting in this movie is very, and I mean VERY good. Hugh Jackman is awesome as the obsessive Angier, and Christian Bale is amazing as the sinister Borden. Michael Caine is as good as always in the role of Cutter. I really like David Bowie's fantastic portrayal of magical genius Tesla.

Overall, this movie is simply amazing, and I'd recommend it to everyone. The acting is great, the direction is great, the story is great, and the twists are amazing. This really deserves some Oscars. See it ASAP.

18 May 2017,An amazing film you should definitely see,"This is an amazing film. Its a film that makes want to see it again instantly after you've first seen it, partly cause you want to see if everything makes sense, and also cause of how spectacular it is. One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful.

22 December 2008,It's Good,"In my motel room the other night I caught this on the movie channel. Here's my thoughts.

""The Prestige"" is kind of like ""The Illusionist"", only a bit different. It is built upon the story of two rising magicians- Alfred (Bale) and Robert (Jackman) who soon become bitter rivals after Alfred seemingly kills his girlfriend on purpose (that would do it for me). They become engrossed in a a game of ""can you top this"" with no rules, causing a lot of tragedy and pain along the way. Near the end of the movie it seems Robert, who has generally been the follower and not the leader, finally pulls of a stunt that blows Alfred's mind. Has Robert finally outdone his foe? See it to find out.

A gripping story, with plenty of action and a lot for the audience to try to work out. The main stars are excellent, brilliantly supported by Michael Caine, and not so much by Scarlett Johansson. One of the better movies of the millennium.",7
22 October 2006,"Thrilling, brilliant, and intelligent","Christopher Nolan is a magician...a magician of cinema: he gives you the setup and then he surprises you with more than one great illusion one right after the other. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are aspiring magicians and friendly rivals until Rupert's wife (Piper Perabo) dies in a freak accident during a magic act. Both men ensue in a deadly and manipulative competition on who is the great illusionist. Angier want obsesses about figuring out a trick Borden has mastered and sets out to beat him in that competition. ""The Prestige"" is a intelligently written and intense story with a surprising sci-fi kick that will you talking. Excellent performance from the cast especially by the two leads Christian Bale (who is my soul mate and true love) and Hugh Jackman that both deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. Scarlet Johanssen is lovely and sexy as the woman they both love and she is the woman who moves in between them and sees them both for who they really are behind the tricks and illusions. I highly recommend this film and I bow before Christopher Nolan as a director who really knows how to make a thriller. Note: please do not confuse this film with ""The Illusionist"" whereas ""The Illusionist"" is a love story ""The Prestige"" is a true psychological thriller and character study.",10
24 November 2014,A first rate movie! The Prestige is a timeless treasure! Will be enjoyed forever!,"Just in case the reader of this review has not watched this movie somehow. I've included no spoilers. I just watched The Prestige again now some 8 years later after its original release with some friends. Even though I still remembered a bit of what to expect in this twisting, turning show. Was still blown away by this first rate movie! My friends who were privileged in it being there first viewing. Had an even more high tend experience as the credits rolled.

Yet because its such a well done show. In its direction of story, screen play, and acting. It all comes together to make a timeless treasure! A movie your going to enjoy again and again. Its movie magic and will entertain people forever! Don't miss out on this movie. This is why movies are made.

10 August 2007,A brilliant film. Great performances mixed with a great story,"I was blown away by The Prestige. I don't know what exactly it was about it. Perhaps it was the incredible performances from Bale, Jackman, Caine, and Johansson. Perhaps it was the well thought out, near perfect script. Or perhaps it was the freshness this film brings to the eyes when first viewed, the same eyes that have seen crap after crap released in theaters. I don't know what it was for me but I must admit I was blown away by The Prestige and I have watched it several more times since first seeing it in theaters that October evening.

The story follows aspiring magicians Angier and Borden as they struggle to both make names for themselves and to have the greatest 'prestige' in London. After a tragic accident, Borden and Angier become enemies. Soon a potentially dangerous rivalry develops between the two as both try to discover the ultimate illusion. What follows is a duel story line set in the past, following the reasons for the rivalry, and a present which follows the adventure of Angier as he tries to match Borden. Both stories are intriguing and will suck the audience in as they rotate screen time.

As stated above four actors give great performances. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) gives one of the best performances of his career and that is certainly saying something. Bale plays the troubled and laid back Borden who is the cause of a terrible accident that causes the rift between him and Angier. Bale gives a very strong performance. He brings depth and sympathy to the character of Borden which I felt was strongly needed. Bale made out Borden to be exactly what he needed to be, a troubled individual who regrets most things in his life.

Hugh Jackman (X-Men) also gives a tremendous performance as Borden's rival Angier. I never thought Jackman much of an actor, especially after seeing Van Helsing, however, he proved me wrong in this. Angier at first is made out to be a good hearted individual with a few flaws but none to serious. Angier goes through a major transformation that I feel few actors could have pulled off. Jackman was able to pull it off and give one of the best performances of his career.

In support are the legendary Michael Caine and the beautiful Scarlet Johansson. Both give very strong performances and help the movie be even better. Caine plays the stage director and sort of mentor to Angier. Johansson plays Angier's stage hand and Borden's lover. Both are exceptional actors who gives exceptional performances in their respected roles. Not too much screen time is given to either which is good. I had a bad feeling these two would some how end up in every scene but thankfully that was not the case.

The story is easy enough to follow... at first. A major twist is around every corner and will keep the audience guessing until the last lines are spoken. The twist isn't so out of nowhere that everyone will be wondering what the hell just happened. Most people will see things they missed earlier when the twists in the film do occur. The plot is well thought out and flows nicely. There are no dry moments of pointless dialog. Everything is important and needed to make the film work. Overall the film is one of the best written I have seen in a long time. A long time.

In my opinion it is one of the best films of 2006 if not the new millennium. The plot is great. The cast is among the best compiled group of actors one could find in one film. The acting those people do is marvelous. Everything looks and feels real and will never have an audience member questioning what is happening on screen. This is key as when a person starts to question things on the screen, the film begins to lose its magical touch. This does not happen once throughout the course of The Prestige.

5/5 stars",8

24 November 2006,Well put together -- but not your happy place!,"Utterly gripping turn of the century English theater tale. Excellent period feel, costumes, sets, engaging interplay between all the characters, pacing, cinematography, all first rate. The audience is mesmerized by the magic acts, the romantic entanglements, but at the same time, is left utterly cold by the complete lack of warmth and humanity. This is not a movie for someone looking for a uplifting, positive two hours. This movie is devoid of any warmth. There are no heroes, no good guys, no role models.

Scientist/inventor Nikola Tesla, whose work all movie goers have seen, even though they may not know it, figures prominently in this movie. Among other things, he invented the Tesla Coil, which is frequently featured in science fiction movies. The coil generates impressive electric displays, like controlled lightning, arcing between electrodes. The main plot of this movie revolves around the use of this electric ""magic"". The movie is not, however, a scientific documentary, and the leaps of logic from Tesla's scientific experimentation, to magic tricks shown in the movie, requires accepting highly implausible events requiring much suspended disbelief, but that fact doesn't detract too much from the movie's allure. The magic is well enough performed to be engaging and plausible. You want to believe it. It works.

The movie doesn't entirely satisfy however. The main thing that does diminish the movie's appeal is the unlikable nature of all the principle characters. You just can't ""like"" them, any of them.

The movie well worth seeing however. Just don't go when you're in a bad mood already. This movie will only make it worse.",8

22 October 2006,Candy for the mind,"I did something tonight that I have never done before. I saw a first run movie, twice in the same weekend. I can't remember the last time I've seen two first run movies in the same weekend (I suspect it was in high school), I do remember the last time I saw the same movie twice in theaters (Memento).

As everyone who knows me know, I'm a serious Christopher Nolan fan. Ever since I saw Memento I've been hailing him as the second coming of Alfred Hitchcock, and have the full expectation that when his career is said and done he will be universally recognized certainly as the greatest director of his time, possibly of all time. Greatness is often achieved by making a single innovation in your craft and repeating it with increasingly mastering execution. No one has ever used non-sequential time lines as effectively as Nolan did with Memento, and my one reservation about his place in Hollywood history has been that that style could never be as masterfully used in another film again... that his second work could never be equaled, let alone surpassed.

The Prestige has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment. The flash backs he used in Begins showed that he has an understanding of the technique that is unrivaled, however the use of it was not nearly as complex as it was in his early works. Prestige more follows his first work, The Following's, use of non-sequential time than Memento's in that the ordering of the scenes is very complex, by far his most complex yet. Not only are the scenes ostensibly randomly arranged, but also in parallel following the thoughts of two men at the same time. But of course the arrangement is not random, the order is there specifically to misdirect the audience... much like the magicians in the film do when performing their tricks.

But it goes beyond misdirection, the scenes themselves are very powerful imagery investigating guilt, sacrifice and obsession... but the time line adds to that as well. Following seemed to use this style to add to the suspense and give the audience a little puzzle to figure out, Memento used them to do all that and force the audience to feel like the protagonist, The Prestige uses it to do everything that Memento did only the protagonist is not on screen, it is audience. With ever twist and turn you feel the mystique of a magic show, scratching your head not at how anything particular on screen happened, but how the story could come together like it does.

The most amazing thing is I still can't figure out how Nolan does it, the emotions Memento and Prestige invoke when seeing them for the first time is pure ecstasy, I know of nothing that can do the same. When its over you wish you could forget everything you just saw and watch it again just to feel that way again and again. But then you watch it again anyhow, because it was so phenomenal with the expectation of not being nearly as good as the first time, and you see all the little things you missed the first time around and just marvel at the mastery of it all and get a chance to look back into the crowd and watch their jaws drop as pieces of the puzzle fall into place.

9/10: Not quite Memento but close. My only misgiving is was I was I had the puzzle together enough to see the big picture about half way through the film, although I know only one person thus far who has had the same experience. Expect to see lots of 10's on this one, they're well deserved.",9
29 March 2009,2 dueling magicians,"well this one was a first a movie about 2 dueling magicians, fighting it out to the death, Michael Caine gives a great performance in here also, the two magicians Borden, and Angiers are dynamic in their tricks, deceit, lies , and overall performance,, the two females characters are also pretty good eye candy. Always been fascinated by magicians,, especially the greatest one of all ,, the late great Harry Houdini, this is a hard movie to keep track of , with all of the twists and turns, it is very good, just kinda hard to follow, with all of the trickery and other things going on in the movie,, this is the kind of movie where yoiu have to watch it a couple of times to get the hang of it,, but otherwise it is an entertaining flick.

10 October 2012,Challenges The Audience,"The Director's trademark complexity and fanciful film gyrations are sometimes a bit too complicated, and in an era of many movies with shallow, silly, stories it's hard to argue that something is too cerebral. Intelligent, thought provoking, layered messaging is not really in vogue.

But this too can be a deterrent when things get out of hand when the sleight of hand and misdirection is overdone to the point of viewer fatigue. The magical momentum that is at the heart of this film can be lost among the intrigue somewhat, and can leave the audience with a bit of an overwhelming experience. This, depending on your movie watching IQ, can be exhilarating or exhausting.

After all, it is a very good film with style and deep twists and turns and is another in a string of surprises from one of today's best Directors.

2 March 2011,"Sumptuous, intriguing, but flat characterisation","Christopher Nolan's sumptuous film, 'The Prestige', tells the story of two warring magicians, each obsessed with each other's trick. The film cleverly uses its subject matter to create a mystery story; and as with all magic tricks, the question as to what is real remains open until the very end. There's even an inventive walk-on part for Nikolai Tesla, the real life creator of the alternating current. The film has weaknesses - in some ways, the two magicians are two similar, I wasn't enamoured of Christian Bale's performance, and perhaps at the end, more could have been made of the fundamental difference between true magic and a trick - the film explains (at least partly), but there's a certain lack of moral resonance. But like all good shows, it lures you in - and the longer you watch, the more you want to find out what's really going on.

31 October 2006,Movie Magic,"""Are you watching closely?"" is the watchword for The Prestige. Like the magic tricks portrayed within, the movie demands you watch closely.

Christopher Nolan employs the same non-linear style he used in Memento and, to a lesser degree, in Batman Begins. Watch closely or you may get lost in the film's many flashbacks and plot twists.

If you pay attention however, you'll be rewarded with a riveting tale of obsession, impressive visuals, and remarkable performances.

See this one on the big screen. Although I will buy the DVD when it's released, this is definitely not a movie you can play in the background at home. I recommend it highly!

5 October 2012,One of the best films by Nolan,"I first should note that I am very rigorous regarding my scoring system. I give 7/10 only for very, very good films, perhaps only for the top 3-2% of all films (I gave Vertigo a 7/10, for instance), so 7/10 should be interpreted as a very good film, but not a masterpiece.

I liked it very much, the characters are well constructed and strong and the performances are memorable and good well around. The ending has a very cool twist as well, though nothing really special: Nolan's films are very entertaining, but he is not a Stanley Kubrick and never will be. Don't watch these films expecting masterpieces, as some of Nolan's fanboys might think. But expect instead high quality entertainment.

20 March 2007,Dark tale of magician rivalry takes many twists and turns...,"Perhaps there is such a thing as a story taking too many twists and turns, and not all of them credible. That's the major fault of THE PRESTIGE which pits two very ambitious magicians (HUGH JACKMAN and Christian BALE) against each other in a manner that hasn't been seen on the screen since Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played dirty tricks on each other in SLEUTH.

But there are other compensations in THE PRESTIGE to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for the serious movie-goer. It captures the look and feel of Victorian England with its beautifully detailed sets, artfully low-key in lighting but teaming with vitality and authentic looking period decor.

Then too, the performances are all at a perfect pitch to make it an ensemble cast of acting pros doing their best to keep you guessing until the final shot. MICHAEL CAINE is wonderful in a colorful supporting role as the man who devises some of the ingenious stunts and SCARLETT JOHANSSON makes the most of a rather brief supporting role as a traitorous magician's assistant. And as the scientist who leaves Jackman with one of his most inspired tricks, David BOWIE is excellent as Tesla.

But the last fifteen minutes are shrouded in such mystery and some highly doubtful explanations that the conclusion comes as a bit of a letdown after all the build-up to what the viewer can only hope will be a plausible ending.

Christopher Nolan does much better with this than he did with MEMENTO, even though the tricky story structure is again likely to add confusion to all the entertaining twists and turns that occur on a regular basis.

But overall, it's a very entertaining and puzzling piece of work with sleight of hand magic at every turn.",7
2 November 2006,The Most Original Movie In Recent Years,"Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE is one of the most shockingly-original films I've ever seen; rather, the book of the same name by Christopher Priest is really the most original. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem ingeniously cast, with Bale as the inwardly-focused, pensive, quiet magician, and Jackman as his rival, a boastful, flashy showman. These characters also mirror the two actors' styles; Bale is more of a deeper character actor, and Jackman is, and always has been, very entertaining to watch, but his acting has always been like a bucket of buttery popcorn; it tastes good when you eat it, but you feel slightly sick after you eat it, and it has no nutritive value. Having said this, the two actors have never been better. The story is ultimately clever, albeit quite confusing at times. Much like the TV show ""Lost"", the pertinent, plot-heavy duologue is intentionally vague, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. Just like a good magic trick - or a good Prestige, rather - the audience willingly immerses themselves in this twisting, creepy world; you WANT to be confused. (This is also the last line of the movie.) AWESOME.",8

23 August 2014,"Unsatisfying, overrated","A film about magicians, and of course magicians make a business tricking people. Usually, though, the audience doesn't figure out the trick, and that's why it works.

Unfortunately here the trick is laid bare and it makes the whole thoroughly disappointing. There is much more promised than delivered, and I find it hard to recommend to anyone.

Part of the disappointment is that it could have been so much more. The premise is interesting, the characters start out interesting... as is, though, it needs a major rewrite.

Sorry.

6 November 2006,Mostly disappointing......,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",2

12 August 2007,"confusing ending, supernatural elements should never have been used","I liked how this film shows you how some of the magic tricks are performed. It doesn't try to make the magicians look like warlocks. The centerpoint of the film is the dark rivalry between Angier and Borden. Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife during a magic trick and they become enemies. They try to one up each other. Angier is obsessed over Borden's Teleported Man trick. He must find out how it is done. He gets a new assistant that he falls for but sends her to Borden to discover the secret. However, she falls for Borden and this cause's Borden's wife to commit suicide. Angier goes to see a scientist and he invents a cloning box using electricity. This is where the supernatural elements come into play. Through a series of events, Borden is accused of Angier's murder and is sentenced to die. But, is Angier really dead? What about Borden? What was the secret to the Teleported Man? All of these questions are answered in a confusing ending, but the cloning part still doesn't make complete sense to me.

FINAL VERDICT: OK, but I though it was difficult to follow and plus a little to long. The film jumps around a timeline and you have to think about what time frame the film is in.",6
15 January 2007,Too dark and mean to be 'magical' to me!,"I must admit that this movie was shot beautifully and acted extremely well! I cannot fault the director with the way the story unfolded... my problem was with the story itself! WAY TOO MEAN AND DARK!

This wasn't a movie about magic at all; it was a revenge movie plain and simple! I don't need to see happy go lucky endings every time I sit in a theater, but to have two characters that have such self loathing and mutual hatred that only intensifies, is disturbing! At the end of the movie, I watched all characters slip into such a dark and mean place, I wanted every one of them to die!

I left the movie wanting the 135 minutes I wasted sitting there returned to me! I think that actors with the talent of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, not to mention the incredible Micheal Cain can choose much better vehicles to showcase their abilities!

10 July 2007,wow,"now now now Mr. Nolan is the master director of these times is not an unknown thing. anyone doubts it pls watch prestige. watch it again and watch it again, try to find faults if u can, there are none. the performances are goood very gooood. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale just kick ass and convince you that they are the characters. the beauty of this movie is the script. the camera work is so cool and profound that you will feel that you are in every frame of the movie, right there watching it happen in front of you. it does get a bit slow in the middle but the end makes up for it this movie talks about rivalry gone wrong wholly wrong. rivalry is good but once it comes to the stage of rivalry Jackman and Bale have in this movie u just know something bad is gonna happen and shows what competition can do to completely normal people. flawless and wow mazing it will leave u stunned this is one film, after watching i was left stunned, never has a movie done that to me. the end will just take u by surprise and make you hail Nolan as the king of the present age. watch it.

21 October 2006,Waste of Talent,"Bale, Jackman, and Caine, now that sounded like it should've been the best movie one could've wanted to see at theatre. I give you at first I kept thinking it was sort of like Batman versus Wolverine. This movie had the potential to be a great film but at best it was a mediocre attempt at a mysterious period piece. The two main characters were unsympathetic and the others were merely window dressings for their obsessions. I am not really all that much of a Caine fan but I can easily say that he did the best performance of these actors. Even though most of the acting was barely on par, the script and editing were far worse. The timing and movement of this piece took it from a passable film to dreadfully long one. The problem with its length is that it gives you so much time that you figured out all the twists and after that what's the point? I felt mislead with this film as well, it was far more of a revenge flick than a historical fiction. If you are interested in magicians and period pieces try the Illusionist. It was a much better constructed film.

2 June 2016,Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige is one of those rare films that truly reward repeated viewing. One would think that a film that relies so heavily on a twist at the end would feel flat the second time around but instead knowing how things fit together allows you to fully appreciate how masterfully it is all foreshadowed.

The script is great, the editing is brilliant and the vision required to bring this to life is staggering. I have watched it three times now and I'm yet to find a flaw in how this is put together. My appreciation grows with each new viewing. The cinematography is great as well. For a period piece it feels remarkably fresh and almost contemporary.

The acting is good if not great. Christian Bale gives a restrained but nuanced performance as Borden while Hugh Jackman impresses as his nemesis Angier. Not Oscar-worthy material but more than serviceable. Among the supporting cast it's worth mentioning Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah and Michael Caine as Cutter. They both provide the heart and soul of this movie, a counterpoint to the single-minded obsession shown by the two protagonists. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are always a delight to watch even if their parts here are fairly small.

A great study in the nature of obsession and how it brings two men into a downward spiral that can only end in disaster. And the journey is just so, so enjoyable. Christopher Nolan's best movie, which is saying something. 10 stars out of 10.",10
17 April 2007,The Kayzer Soze syndrome (SPOILER ALERT),"All I want to tell you about The Prestige is that it definitely suffers from the Kayzer Soze syndrome. For those who do not know who Kayzer Soze is -- go watch The Usual Suspects. Since the release of that film there have been quite a lot of Hollywood releases that have tried to copy the formula from Usual Suspects. The problem is, however, 1) the formula is sucked dry by now, and 2) in order to amuse the audience, they need to feel respected and not be messed with. It's not the amount of plot twists that matters, it's the quality. The Usual Suspects had a single plot twist and it was a brilliant one. The Prestige has a whole bunch of twists, none of which are credible or intelligent. And, one must not forget (SPOILER ALERT), the only one dumb enough to use the twin brother concept as a cover-up for plot holes, is Jean-Claude van Damme. Oh, and I must admit, apart from the plot, the acting, cinematography and directing itself is pretty good. Especially Jackman has shown to be more than a mere Muscles from Brussels or whatever town he's from.

7 November 2006,"A ""Prestige""ous film","The Prestige is a film, ostensibly, about illusion. But, in truth, it is more about maintaining the illusion at all costs, and how that illusion is used as a tool and excuse for the most destructive and obsessive of behavior. Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to the much heralded Batman Begins, The Prestige is not as good as that film, but it is still an entertaining and, at times, challenging romp.

Set in the waning years of the 1800s, The Prestige focuses on two stage magicians, Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They are assistants to another magician, learning the craft, but they are both striving to make their own way in the magic world. After an accident during a performance kills Angier's wife (Piper Perabo), and is ostensibly Borden's fault, the two part ways and begin feuding with each other, sabotaging the other's performances in vicious and violent ways in a constant game of one-upsmanship. When Borden reveals his signature trick, dubbed The Transported Man, Angier, along with assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) and ingenieur Cutter (Michael Caine), develop their own version of the trick, but that isn't enough for Angier, who is convinced that Borden is not using the traditional methods for such a trick (the application of a double, Angier's way),and sends Olivia to spy on him, eventually finding himself on a trip to America to discover the truth of Borden's act.

In keeping with Nolan's repertoire to date, The Prestige is a film about individuals who are not the most stable or well-adjusted. These are men who have sacrificed everything, those they love, their health and more to constantly stay one step ahead of the other. The live in a world of illusion, fueled by the desire to keep the other guessing and to hear the thrill of the audience when they have pulled off a good trick. Both Angier and Borden are tragic characters, neither really has much of a bright side, and even when they find some happiness, the pull of their obsession, and other hidden secrets, keep them from enjoying it. You can credit Nolan and his co-writer, brother Jonathan, for not failing to follow this dark subject matter to its eventual conclusion. At the same time, The Prestige is hardly an upbeat film, and these are dark men living dark lives, so it would be easy to see some audience members turned off by the uncompromising nature of this film.

The Prestige falls a little short of fleshing out the relationships with Angier and Borden's significant others, in Angier's case Olivia and for Borden, wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall). There is a little more depth to the Borden/Sarah pairing, as she realizes that as much as she loves him, she will always come second to his magic and feud. The relationship between Angier and Olivia is much more shallow, and Johansson proves to have an almost cameo level role, not making much of an impression in the grand scheme of the film.

For fans of Christopher Priest's novel, the meat of the story is there, but the modern day framing device has been removed. However, the Nolans have maintained one significant aspect of the book, the telling of a majority of the story through one character's reading of the other's notes and journals. Nolan uses this to play with chronology, as he did in Memento, but not to the same degree as in that groundbreaking film, and the audience should have no difficulty following what is happening.

All the actors are in good form, especially Bale and Jackman. They sell the dark feud between these men well, but also their fascination with magic. While Bale has what seems the showier role, Jackman actually stands out greater in this film, playing a role that is a little different than what he has tackled previously. Caine is his usual reliable best as Cutter, a minor character in the novel blown up to a larger part here. The film has a strong, distinguished look that sells the period well, with great cinematography by Wally Pfister.

The Prestige isn't Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement, it is a little under Memento and Batman Begins, but overall it is a good show that is worth enjoying. Just don't believe everything you see.",8

25 November 2006,"Finally, a film you can really sink your teeth into, and boy is it juicy!","Brilliant screenplay. Excellent acting. Perfect directing. Oscar goes to the Director, screenwriter, Actor Hugh Jackman, Supporting actor David Bowie. Yes, David Bowie is outstanding as Tesla. I could imagine an entire movie based on his character alone.

I am a very discerning movie aficionado, and this the best film I have seen in years. A masterpiece of film-making thanks to Chistopher Nolan and his brother. Christian Bale is also very convincing in his role as he always is in every film in which he acts. I wish I could buy shares in his career fund. I would surely make a million!

Michael Caine is always great as a supporting role and adds a dimension of warmth and humanity to every film he is in.

This is one film you won't want to miss a moment of, so get your snacks well before the opening scene.

See it! You won't be disappointed!",10
3 February 2007,Riveting,"I actually saw Prestige by accident; although I had heard good reviews there were other films that I preferred to see. As it happens the night I was at the cinema the film I had wanted to see was sold out and I decided to see Prestige instead. I can only say it was a superb film (even better then the film I had originally wanted to see).

I thought both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale portrayed their characters in a really realistic way, and it was difficult to decide which one you would support, as like real life, the moment you thought one was better then the other, they went and did something that totally spoilt your choice and you were back to square one.

It was a slower moving film, but it was handled brilliantly, and the twists were simple but effective.

Quite simply it was the best film I had seen of 2006.",10

23 October 2006,Prepare to pay attention to every detail...the film is a trick in itself..,"Prepare for non-linear, plot twisting writing. The film is shot in a 3 act fashion which is the secret formula to a great film whether non linear or shot in order. The acting was superb and the character development fully fleshed out all the characters most importantly Bale and Jackman as two competitors in show business in Vicorian era London where the beautiful costumes and set design transport the viewer there in the middle of early metropolitan media hyped civilization. Sometimes a showman is in the business strictly to hear the applause of a crowd, to feed the ego. A showman will go to desperate lengths to be # 1 on the billboard charts or in this case invent the best magic trick in a time when magicians were as popular as pop singers and rock stars. But what if the magic trick is not magic as we know it. Magic is a trick. But real magic is science.

The film is not a realistic revenge drama/mystery. I suggest you walk into the theater prepared to see a Science Fiction film. The movie can deceive you into thinking it's a serious factual film. The film is never boring though. To me at least being a huge Twilight Zone and Star Trek fan. The characters really hate each other, and you feel their envy, hatred and jealousy in every scene. The only problem with the film is that it shifts from realistic revenge drama to a long twilight zone episode after the midway point, which can cause some audiences to be let down or disappointed . Love it or Hate it film. But it's not easy disregard the smart script, off guard plot twists, and great acting. Spiritual religious people and Science fans will love the story because of the hope we get from realizations that humanity can achieve when all the bad emotions are tucked away. Science heals and science kills, but it all depends on the soul of the man who controls the science. 3 1/2 stars. 7/10.",8

21 February 2007,It's not all that...,"Well, I've been interested in cinematography for the past 10 years of my life, I've watched all kinds of movies and I always seek the best, and please remember this is just my opinion...

I watched the movie expecting something HUGE after all that hype, and I have to say, I couldn't be more disappointed, the twists were so clear from the beginning, the whole story seemed so trivial to me, it really doesn't deserve the hype or the high rating it got, although I couldn't say anything but ""Brilliant"" about the acting, that was the highlight of the whole thing, the directing was just ""Decent"" at most, and the make up was ""Horrible"".

I gave this movie 5/10 only for the acting, the clothing and the decoration.

21 May 2007,Great trick....how did they do that ?,"I totally enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The acting, costumes, and locations were superb. Funny, the only other movie I've enjoyed as much this year was ""The Illusionist"". (Pick a card, any card....) I've always been interested in the life and times of Nikola Tesla. This movie was a great tribute to this misunderstood, brilliant scientist. Yes, just like time-travel scenarios, this film makes you think but not enough to give you a brain cramp. It's twists and turns rival the most demanding road rally track and will keep you involved the whole time. Not too many films do that for me anymore. It's a terrific way to spend 130 minutes. Be sure to have plenty of popcorn on hand.

14 March 2015,Are you watching closely!,"This has got to be one of the best movies ever made that looks at the lives of illusionists and the great pains they have gone through in times past. The Prestige has an amazing and talented cast, with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and Ricky Jay, all putting in terrific performances, playing their roles perfectly. Also, how awesome was David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, what perfect casting on Nolan's part. Speaking of Nolan, I have yet to see him make a bad movie, in fact, his movies just keep on getting better and better. Between the awesome script both he and his brother wrote, and the breath taking cinematography of Wally Pfister, Prestige is utterly perfect. And what an ending, it made want to watch it again right away, just incredible. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS19QL3VAkk

I thought i had the plot pretty much sussed at one point, then WHAM, with a twist and sting in the tail my ideas were altered, leaving me bewildered and gob smacked.

I spent nearly the same amount of time after seeing the Prestige simply discussing and unwinding the little details that conclude the film with my friends.

If i had any doubts about Christian Bale- I now stand corrected. He was perfectly believable, with not even Michael Caine shadowing him. Plus this was a perfect role for Hugh Jackman to come out of his shell- after playing stereotypical dark and mysterious super heroes with cheesy lines lately.

11 November 2006,Nolan rules...,"Christopher Nolan rules... I have seen most of Nolan's previous work - The Following (mostly unkonwn in this part of the world), Memento (his breakthrough) and Batman Begins. With increasing budgets for each of these films the rich layered texture of his scripts has becomes grander without taking anything away from the script.

With Batman Begins Nolan used two great acting talents in Christian Bale and Micheal Cane. Cane is a proved talent while Bale is establishing himself as up and coming leading man (courtesy Christopher Nolan). He has used that combination again with addition of another dependable star - Hugh Jackman.

Jackman and Bale are two Illusianists who are learning the ropes of putting up new illusions under the tutelage of Cane, the master illusion builder. Amongst the two Bale is a natural illusionist while Jackman is the natural showman. Their friendship is never really developed or even implied though they are shown to be friendly but always competitive. However an on-stage accident changes all that and turns the competition into rivalry and as the years pass by rivalry turns life threatening.

However great the cast maybe the star of a typical Nolan movie is its script. His movies use actors as puppets - like Hitchcock used his actors. The characters come in and say things that are absolutely baffling and at the end of the film all the random straws are neatly tied into place and suddenly make sense.

A great film that needs to watched at least twice... I am eagerly anticipating the DVD release of the movie.",9
22 October 2006,'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome!,"Christopher Nolan has been on the brink of penetrating Hollywood's elite silver circle of directors since his second feature-film, 'Memento,' which caught the attention of audiences and critics alike and became an instant cult classic. After the tremendous success that was 'Batman Begins,' he assured movie-fanatics across the nation that he was for real. 'The Prestige,' a marvelously directed era extravaganza with top-notch acting and a beguiling script, tells one of the fiercest tales of jealousy, obsession and loathsome rivalry. Christian Bale delivers a tantalizing performance as Alfred Borden, the stories superior magician that lacks the showmanship to be the greatest. Jackman's performance is the perfect counterpoint as he plays the envious adversary who's willing to do anything to uncover his foe's methods. From a technical standpoint, this thriller is nearly faultless, and Nolan magically keeps his audience guessing until the final shot. 'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome! Are you watching closely?",9
26 November 2006,Riveting,"I saw this movie today, and it was AMAZING. Throughout the entire thing, I was thrilled and absolutely absorbed in the story.

It has a very interesting plot line and explores how far people are willing to go to achieve their ultimate goal. The lengths to which the main characters go to are shocking and unbelievable.

Overall it is a very complex and riveting dark story but unsuitable for those who are easily frightened as there are some very frightening (and in one scene, disgusting) scenes. I remember, in the cinema, the man in front of me used his asthma puffer multiple times during the film.

But if you can handle a bit of a scare and some dark themes, this is a GREAT movie, a must watch!!!!",9

14 November 2006,Fantastic!,"""Are you watching closely"". The Prestige is the best film i have ever seen in the cinema. A film which has Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine and Scarlet Johansson is bound to be a shocker. This film is about two magicians trying to be the best by preforming the transporting man trick, but there's a twist. A very good twist which leaves you guessing all the way through. This film is very confusing, but at the end all the questions you had will be answered (hopefully). With brilliant performances from all the cast members this is a film which must be seen by anyone who loves mysteries and magical mayhem. So get up and walk down to your local cinema and watch The Prestige.

8 November 2006,Wow!!!,"It has been a long time since I was as impressed by a movie as I was by this one. Stellar acting by everyone involved, a storyline that makes you think and a very intriguing plot. I'm usually pretty good at guessing the twist ending long before the end, sometimes even before I see the film, but I didn't guess it this time. The casting was just excellent. Everything flowed perfectly. Plenty of twists and turns without seeming ponderous. And the ending was tied up quite neatly, unlike many films that don't seem to know how to wrap themselves up when they have as much to tie together as this one. I can't rate this one highly enough. It is well worth the money paid to see it, and I am more than ready to pay to see it again.

7 November 2006,"More like ""Memento"" than ""Batman Begins.""","As a former professional magician, the concept of this movie is close to my heart. It was fun seeing Ricky Jay, a real magician, playing a small part. Equally fun was the faithfulness with which most of the magic was presented. Rather than stoop to the level of camera tricks, the magic presented is the same as it would be presented by any modern day magician.

Similar to ""Memento,"" this movie skips about in the time line where some information presented earlier makes more sense later when you see it in context. Be prepared for rather plodding plot more in keeping with the offerings of M. Night Shyamalan with a similar style twisting ending. Personally, I guessed the ending too early.

Faithfully reproduces the time period.

Personally, I think Hugh Jackman (as Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (as Alfred Borden) are too similar looking in appearance and demeanor, which made keep track of who was whom a bit distracting for me.",7
3 May 2009,very good movie,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
30 May 2017,Loses impact on a second viewing,"The first time I saw The Prestige I was absolutely blown away by it. I was staring at the screen, slack jawed, halfway through the credits. The twist ending in this is phenomenal and mind-bending... the first time. Once you know the twist, however, it seems like the film has no point. Watch it once, have your mind blown and then just let that be the film experience you associate with this film, because the second time is just disappointing.

26 November 2006,Nolan Delivers Another Fine Film.,"Christopher Nolan delivers another fine film with Christian Bale and Micheal Caine in tow, again. Like Batman Begins, the cinematography in The Prestige draws in the viewer whether the shot is a panoramic Rocky Mountain landscape or a squalid London slum. Nolan's sets are intrinsic to the story and make the unfolding drama all the more compelling. So much of the story is dependent upon the scenario in which a scene occurs. This is a period piece for the 21st century. The performances are very good to excellent by the entire cast. Christian Bale satisfies again with his nuanced role as a competitive illusionist. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman going for roles of substance given his strong acting ability. Micheal Caine, legendary, enough said. The women in the film are equally good. I was floored to learn that Ms. Perabo, who plays Bale's wife in the film, is a native of New Jersey. Her period London accent is flawless. Scarlett Johannsen develops nicely in this film and as long as she seeks dimensional characters like this, she can count on a long and rewarding career. Seeing Bowie on film is always a treat. His turn as Nikola Telsa is well suited to his repertoire. The story is well written and superbly directed. Anybody who writes a spoiler to this film is doing those who have not seen the film a disservice. I only hope Nolan can get the recognition he deserves when all the awards are given.",10
11 December 2008,They Want to Be Fooled,"This film is, on the surface, a story concerning rival magicians in Victorian London. But, at the heart of things, it is really a film about film-making.

As far as I'm concerned, the goal of any film is threefold. I call it the 3 Es: Engage, Entertain, and Enlighten. Before either of the later two can happen, the audience must first be engaged. This means giving them a point of reference; that is to say, introduce them to something familiar right off the bat: a character that is relatable, and a situation or conflict that is easily comprehended. Once the audience is engaged, it is the filmmaker's duty to then entertain them, by putting the established characters in humorous or nerve-racking situations. There is a certain flare for creating truly entertaining scenes that only a few select directors possess. There is a kind of showmanship quality to film-making. The final thing a film must do is enlighten the audience. That is, the film should come to a point that stimulates the mind of the viewer. This is not always achieved and is even more difficult to pull off than pure entertainment. This third aspect is what separates great films from those that are simply good. It helps the film stick in people's minds long after they have seen it.

The above three elements of the film viewing experience are directly comparable to the three stages of a magic trick, as discussed in ""The Prestige"". These are The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Turn is when the audience is shown something ordinary; a handkerchief or a small bird. This is much like the beginning of a film when the audience is engaged by something equally familiar. The second part is The Turn, when the ordinary thing is made to do something extraordinary, like disappear. ""But,"" as Michael Caine's character says in the the film, ""you wouldn't clap yet. It's not enough to make something disappear. You have to bring it back."" This seemingly miraculous return of the vanished object is The Prestige, and it is the most important part of the trick. These latter two parts are similar to the way entertaining the audience can bring them to something enlightening; how a heart pounding chase scene can wind and twist and turn, and then deposit us at some great, profound truth.

Another convention of magic tricks that is shared in film-making is the suspension of disbelief. It is said in the film that the audience knows that it is only an illusion, but they don't want to know how it is accomplished. ""They want to be fooled"", as they say. This is equally true with the film viewing experience. Any individual of even average intelligence knows full well that what they are witnessing on screen is not entirely real, but they ignore that fact. They want something extraordinary. They want to see something aside from their familiar reality. They want to escape, and it is the job of both the magician and the filmmaker to render a believable fantasy for the viewing public.

Filmmakers are the magicians of their day. With both magic and cinema, people go to the theater to see something outside of their own, regular experience. They are, at first, presented with something against which they can compare their own lives. ""I know what this is. I get this"", they think to themselves. Then, through this relatable proxy, the audience is taken on a journey into previously unknown territory, where they witness things they had never imagined and certainly did not expect. Then, at the end of this voyage, and indeed because of it, we come to a profundity that we had not known, yet it is undeniably true. We leave the theater having gained a fuller experience. Or course we know it was all smoke and mirrors, but to dwell on this notion would ruin something very special.",10
8 May 2018,decent,"This was a movie about rival illusionists who are hell-bent and obsessed with learning each other's secrets. After a trick goes horribly wrong, one becomes more obsessed. I liked the cast and the magic tricks, but feel like the movie dragged and was too slow in places. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, David Bowie, and Scarlett Johansen were all good as the stars. If you want to see a movie about illusionists and magic and rivals, this might satisfy you.

20 April 2008,"we turn the dice,the movies turns the table..........","i start by giving it ..nothing less than 10 ......it deserves it ...anyway

this movies is scripted beautifully,has a sense of mystery and clever too because it has to cover many sub plots also,and the writer is ..more than successful in achieving it.The dialogs and the cinematography of the scenes with long shots is fabulous in all senses.

The story takes away the show by some extraordinary twists and turns and a strange flow of its own kind.And apart form the huge twists one after another,they are stated in such manner that people can also believe them at the time they come crashing there brains....!!

Coming from one of the best directors today ..The Prestige is indeed prestigious,and by far one of the greats of all time ..and deserves a place at least higher to No Country For Old Men..in the 250 chart.

At last i recommend it strongly to....own a DVD of this movie...if you like content full films of any kind ........you will not be disappointed at all.....

sit back...and let the magic fascinate you ....... and you will leave with long lasting effects ..of disbelieve and pleasure ..........

hats off or this one ....",10
14 June 2021,A Glazing Masterpiece,"Undoubtedly regarded as a masterpiece, this Jackman and Bale starrer is smart , intriguing tale of deceit and obsession tailored by the genius of Christopher Nolan. Prestige is a cinematic marvel , a dazzling period drama which doesn't stop challenging its audience. A Magnum Opus no questions asked.

1 October 2007,A masterpiece!!!!,"After taking a long break from magic related movies in Hollywood; cinema-goers were struck by this movie and the respect it so-obviously demanded. Throughout the movie one cant help but to be attracted to its underlined sense of mystery and the urge to unfold the secret of the magic tool to which we are introduced, in the beginning of the film. With astonishing performances by both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, i would would gladly gives two thumbs up to this motion picture. However, some may claim that the strong resemblance to the movie 'The Illusionist' may have stolen some its charm, seeing as both movies were released at around the same time.

9 December 2006,Great story. Well made.,"""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, The Prestige; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The above quote is from perhaps the year's best trailer, and also appears early in ""The Prestige"", which features one of the year's best casts and crew. The quote parallels the movie quite well, explaining what works, what doesn't, and why.

Directed by home run hitter Christopher Nolan (""Batman Begins"", ""Memento""), ""The Prestige"" stars a couple erstwhile superheroes (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) woven into a turn of last century tale about two rival magicians intent on one-upping each other. Simple enough, that's The Pledge.

The Turn, which takes up the majority of the running time, is where Nolan and company work their movie magic. The story is told largely through various flashbacks before going linear in last act. A little work is required to follow the multi-pronged timeline, but if one lets the pieces float for a bit, they will come together over the course of the film. The patience to wait for that confluence shouldn't be a problem, because all involved sell the period piece wholeheartedly. Capes, canes, and top hats often induce boredom, but although the costumes are period, ""Prestige"" doesn't have the antiquated feel that many such films possess. Instead it radiates energy, feeling similar to a Broadway play thanks in part to the star wattage of Jackman and Bale, who both slip comfortably from rubber suits to three-piece suits. Their previous and future movie roles actually inject a little humor into the proceedings as one envisions Logan or Bruce Wayne donning such outfits and dealing with the various circumstances. Interestingly, Batman would likely be comfortable in this world, even though Prestige is set a century ago, because cinematographer Wally Pfister crafts a intriguing, borderline-Gothic world calls to mind his dark work in ""Batman Begins"", a movie that appears very different, but also shares themes like mystery and illusion.

As one would expect from a magic-themed movie and as The Prestige implies, there are a number of twists and turns, several of which are unveiled in the third act. Figuring these things out in advance may hamper or at least alter your enjoyment of the film, particularly if you are expecting to be surprised. In one sense a line from the movie is true: when the secret is known, the trick seems ordinary, and that extra layer of quality is stripped away. But such knowledge in no way ruins the showmanship of the trick, or in this case the remarkably high production value of the film, which pushes the a good story to a higher level.

Bottom Line: A well-made film with an original story that entertains to the end. 8 of 10.",8
6 July 2023,Brilliant storytelling!,"Christopher Nolan absolutely knocks it out od the park on this subtle masterpiece of outstanding storytelling and character development. Nolan takes the audience on a century-old ride into real entertainment and excitement. Both magicians are desperately amazing and flawed at the same time, and audience is left guessing at every turn. Nolan once again challenges his audience with an outstanding story, which is perfectly delivered by a star-studded cast that does not disappoint. Bale is especially amazing as he keeps the audience in a trance of excitement and confusion. As usual, Michael Caine flies under the radar but steals the show at times. However, the real magic is the classic Nolan twists and turns that make a great story even better with every pledge, turn and prestige!

2 April 2020,great!,"The point is that you are eager to be deceived by the plot from the beginning. When you are completely caught in a scam, all you see is what the director wants you to see. This is also the greatness of the film. Christopher Nolan has the same level of control over movie watching emotions as Hitchcock!

4 February 2019,What a mess,"So many characters, so many plot twists, so many relationships, so many secrets and tricks... In the end, we are left feeling bored. This film was clearly designed as an allegory of a magic trick, but it lacks the punch line, or the so-called 'prestige'. It is never quite clear who is in love with whom in this film, who is angry at whom and why, or why the characters do what they do. Are they just fanatical competitors, or is it all about revenge for what they did in private? You see, it is impossible to grasp the motivation of these characters, because frankly, most of the time their actions are either extremely childish or outright psychotic. Yet the characters are not portrayed as such, so when they act the way they act, one is not quite sure what they are doing. Also, the script is not only needlessly convoluted, but it is also too lazy for a film that is all about clever tricks. These magicians go to such extreme lengths to fool others, yet the script makes them look dumb whenever it is convenient for the screenwriter. How can these masters of magic manage to never recognize one another, just because they are wearing a fake beard? How come they are fooled by a fake belly and a fake nose? How come they never anticipate the other might try and sabotage their act, and take necessary precautions? There are so many moments where these otherwise super cunning characters act like complete idiots. And that ruins the fun. But what really ruins it for me is that the ending reveals absolutely nothing of any interest, other than things everyone in the audience already knew at that point. Why were these two sabotaging and outdoing each other like this? Guess they were crazy after all. But that is not a satisfying ending.",1

24 October 2006,"Great Adpatation, Entertaining, Keeps You Thinking","Having read the book by Christopher Priest, I was looking forward to how this story would translate to the big screen. I was not disappointed.

Overall, we the core elements of the novel version: a story of two magical acts who are obsessed over a single trick and their drive to continually outdo and sabotage each other. This obsession drives them to lose loved ones, forgo their humanity, and in the end, commit murder.

The film layers on twist upon twist, with plenty of foreshadowing and a clever dual between the characters via their diaries. While the earlier magic-themed release of ""The Illusionist"" was an elegant period piece with a single twist, this film delves into the darker nature of humanity, and what it means to be truly obsessed. Both versions of the trick ""The Transported Man"" will keep you thinking for days, and you will find yourself asking ""would I have done what they did to perform the greatest trick in the world?""

This film will definitely find a place in my library upon DVD release.",9
23 July 2010,Christopher Nolan's Best Film,"With all the furore surrounding Inception, this is a good time to rediscover Nolan's earlier (and, it has to be said, much better) movie, The Prestige. The tale of two competing magicians in the 1800's, the film is blessed with great performances throughout and a story so ingenious, so convoluted, so beautifully realised that it will keep you guessing till the final frame and will have you discussing the story for days after first viewing. While it evidently didn't achieve the box office clout of Nolan's bigger films, this is nonetheless a superb piece of cinema and one that I would heartily recommend to anyone who appreciates an ingenious story.

22 October 2006,One of the worst movies ever,"It's the longest movie I've ever sit through, it felt like 9 or 10 hours at least. Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted and stupid written only to get to the last ""shocking reveal"" that ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood believe that people are still impressed or interested in this ""usual suspect"" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need to be ""fooled"", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige). And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible or at least smart. No luck with that. Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of hours of my time with it. Save yours, go see anything else, avoid at all costs, it is worse than Al Quaeda.

9 November 2006,"Outstanding. Yet another in Christopher Nolan's increasingly heavy bag of tricks that'll leave you begging the question ""How does he do it?""","Obsession, a theme dealt with countless times before, is never one that grows old in narrative cinema. We see it manifest itself in almost every genre, from epic crime sagas like Michael Mann's Heat (1995) to anti-eroticism like David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), such is its generic influence. The Prestige, the latest from wunderkid Christopher Nolan, is a movie very much rooted in obsession, but more importantly how in-human people are willing to go in order to feed there obsession. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, a wannabe-magician, and brilliant showman whose trickster talents are sadly lacking the amazement that Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) enriches his magic with. Borden, meanwhile, lacks the showmanship of Angier, and can only sell his act for its amazement, in spite of its wizardry. Beginning their careers as apprentices, both Angier and Borden work with each other at first, but as is established early on in Nolan's film, their friendship turns to rivalry, and inevitably in death, as the non-linear narrative establishes early on that Borden has been charged with the murder of Angier's character, and sentenced to a jail cell. Yet not is all as it seems, as the twisted nature of the plot keeps the audience firmly on their toes throughout the proceedings.

Despite its period setting, very seldom do we get a sense of visual history. Nolan isn't interested in wetting our appetites for milieu, but rather treats this for what it is: a complex character study. It may be 19th century England but that doesn't mean we don't get hand-held camera shots or contemporary music (at least when the credits start to roll). As Michael Caine's character Cutter rightfully points out, ""Obsession is a young man's game"". Both Borden and Angier are willing to sacrifice themselves in order to be the best magician there is. But only the one who never lets up from their act for a second will truly succeed. This obsession is what keeps us, the viewers, guessing from start to finish. We are never entirely sure who has the upper hand in this war of wizardry, which is part of the puzzling enjoyment of this utterly compelling piece of work. The Prestige constantly hoodwinks its audience from beginning to end, with its various twists and turns that, in that Christopher Nolan kind of way, never quite give you all the pieces to the puzzle. But the more he hides from his audience, the more we become intrigued, querying the complex narrative as much as Angier obsesses over Borden's talents.

Whilst The Prestige is a complex film at the best of times, the borderline between puzzling and baffling is rarely crossed. In the same way that Nolan's previous masterpiece Memento (2001) took full advantage of the jumpy nature of its unique narrative, The Prestige goes as far as flashing back from within a flash back. It is an instance of cinema that creates enjoyment out of its complexity, rather than sheer confusion, as Nolan manages to unravel the intricate non-linear narrative in a superbly told way. The weight of the performances also plays a part in marking this film's brilliance. Jackman, whose talents had previously been hidden behind flashy special effects, delivers a great performance of a man every bit as obsessed with his work as he is with Borden. Christian Bale is fast emerging as one of the most talented leading men those Hollywood posses. Yet the outstanding performance in the film is arguably Michael Caine, who possesses a tower of screen presence as the adviser and mentor of both men. It is perhaps a shame then that Scarlett Johansson's performance, as the in-between lover of both men, only seems to come alive when her English accent starts to wane. It is not so much a bad performance as it is an inappropriately reserved one, with all her effort in perfecting the London twang draining any weight from her natural screen presence. Yet whatever small quibble one might have of this film is only trivial, as this is clearly one of the best films of the year so far. Whilst the presence of David Bowie is enough to sink any movie, the sheer dramatic power generated by Nolan's film is enough to drown out any flaws, few as they may be, from foiling this magic trick. This is without question one of the best films of the year. Is Oscar watching?",8
6 February 2023,Amazing movie,"This is a really good movie. It's interesting to watch. The first time I watched it I was a little confused until the END!!!! The end really got me. Such an amazing twist, but some parts of this movie are sad. It's a little sad but very heartwarming as well. I didn't think I would like a movie about magicians but wow this movie is amazing. I have seen it 4 or 5 times in the past 6 years since I first watched it. When you realize what's going on it will blow your mind. It helps also that Christian Bale is not hard to look at as well. He's absolutely so gorgeous!!! I do have to say that every time I watch it. I get more and more intrigued by the twist. This movie is top tier!

5 March 2023,Tell me underrated movie higher than this!!,"Christopher Nolan is no doubt currently the best director on the face of the planet. I was hoping for a good movie but this goes way higher than my expectations yet criminally underrated! Top notch directing, brilliant acting and unique twists make this movie one of the best movie Hollywood ever produced. One of the best thing about Christopher Nolan movies is that you have to pay attention to the small things as well. For example in prestige, when the kid asks "" where is his brother? "" was a moment i thought could be of importance which eventually proves correct. I won't spoil any bit of this masterpiece! But I'll suggest to watch it twice in order to grab how brilliant this movie is!

13 November 2006,Did you watch it closely?,"After some of the reviews this film was receiving from the popular press i was quite reticent in going to see it, my major motivation for going was namely the direction of Christopher Nolan and the extremely accomplished acting of Christian Bale, however after i finished watching this film i was nothing but shocked, amazed and truly humbled by one of the greatest pieces of film-making i have seen in rather a long time.

I would like to start my review by saying this film is NOT and i repeat NOT about the revelation of the trick and how it was achieved. I have read some rather snooty and sniping comments levelled at this film and how they state that they saw the twist coming from a mile off....that is the point, there are enough clues throughout the film to show the spectator what is going to happen and Nolan does not hide these facts, they are there for a reason and i will not give the true reason away, all i will say is that if you know what makes Psycho and the Usual Suspects such masterpieces then you will know why The Prestige is a film of such ilk.

Not only does this film have such a strong story it also sets itself in such a believable period of time, no expense is spared on the set design, the cinematography and editing has all the hallmarks and contemporary feel of a Nolan film, however it adds a haunting and almost tangible feel of impending dread throughout. The immediacy of the film meant as a spectator i was never left flagging and i was shocked to realise that this film was 2 hours and 20 plus minutes long as it felt i had barely sat in my seat before the credits rolled at the end, such the power of this film is that it felt that i had been on a journey with the main protagonists and came out of it a different person.

My one concern of this film was the performance of Scarlett Johannsen. I am aware that she is in the film as part of the exposition, however she is that bad and her abilities are that wooden that i still sit here in amazement in how she can still get work in Hollywood, however that is just a small point and thankfully her part is limited.

In conclusion i feel that this film will be misinterpreted a lot and if you you like your twists in the Saw or Seven vein (good films that they are) then i feel that you will be left disappointed, however if you want to see a masterpiece of film technique and true grandiose themes then The Prestige will be for you, I watched it closely and i got the point...so the question is did you?",9
29 August 2011,Sophisticated Movie,"The movie is astonishingly good. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time guessing what was behind this ""Transported Man"" trick. I had my own guess, but it turns out I was fooled along with others. The plot is very sophisticated, almost flawless and with the appropriately woven science-fiction scenes. 19th century London being on the edge of new ""electrified"" era was shown perfectly well, all the costumes matched the time, as well as the exteriors. The actors did a good job depicting their characters, especially I would like to point out the performance of Christian Bale.

The movie is fully complete, doesn't require a sequel. Such movies are a very rare thing and are definitely must-watch!

8 February 2008,Brilliantly conceived and executed,"The Prestige is a tale of bitter revenge between two rival magicians during the end of the 19th century. The film is set largely in a bleak London which helps to portray the true grubby nature of the obsessions that begin to envelop the two young magicians played magnificently by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden).

The story is truly engrossing; the nature of the magician and the compulsion of Angier and Borden to constantly outdo the other provide the perfect ammunition to twist and weave the plot without slipping into the realms of the implausible. Illusion is the order of the day and the constant frustration of both Angier and Borden as they try to discover the truths behind (and sabotage) each other's tricks is palpable.

Michael Caine as Cutter  Angier's friend and career aide  puts in a stellar performance as do Rebecca Hall (Julia) and Scarlett Johansson (Olivia) as the two love interests (although their screen-time is minimal). David Bowie (Tesla) is fantastic as the scientist visited by Angier in the hope of discovering and besting Borden's greatest trick: the transporting man. It is this particular trick that is the focal point of a cinematic climax that will be remembered (and applauded) for a long time.

The last time a film left my head spinning as much as this was after watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time, and I cannot give any higher praise then that.

Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of enlightening us to the ins and outs of the magician's industry at the turn of the century (where stage entertainment was a massive money-spinner) whilst still leaving an element of wonder and mysticism. The portrayal of these two men as solely committed to their magic (at the expense of all else) is brilliantly conceived. The film is shot beautifully and the direction is spot-on considering the difficult era being portrayed.

There is only one slight word of caution: the film is cut very tightly and jumps from the perspective of both Angier and Borden through two time threads, often too swiftly. This isn't a criticism as such, merely a warning to those that don't like non-linear story telling as it could become confusing.

Overall a brilliant piece of work that will please and delight almost any audience.",9

15 January 2007,LOVED the trick with the canary!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

7 February 2008,Pay Close Attention,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.

After seeing ""The Illusionist,"" which I thought was amazing a magic movie can get, I held my expectations really high for ""The Prestige."" I'm comparing these two films because they were released close to each other, with a similar genre as magic films. Which is the better movie, you ask? ""The Illusionist"" blows ""The Prestige"" away.

I'm starting to wonder why this film has such a high rating. Probably a lot of fans of Christopher Nolan, who is known for making great films, such as ""batman Begins"" and ""Memento."" I would say this movie is just mediocre, and not at the level of his usual films.

I will say this film has style. The cinematography was great. What I was disappointed by this film is the on going predictable-ness. I might be in the majority when I said this. I saw the twist coming. What came from the very first scene in the film was a great ""pay attention to the movie!"" moment but it went downhill from there.

Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing at least two times from two very laughable and improbable scenes. Other than that, the film tries to be clever and trying to create something new at the same time. But all fails. It's mediocre at best from the storytelling. The performances were decent, in the end.

Overall, I found it a hard film to love and to watch over and over again (they say watching this film over and over again will make it better). The visual effects were good, the plot may give you some disbelief, and the film is just one step back for Nolan. It's a worthy rent, at least.",6

11 November 2006,Enjoyable but Far-fetched,"The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and takes place in late Victorian London. The movie is enjoyable but just a little disappointing given the ecstatic reviews. Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play two competing magicians who start out as colleagues and end up as deadly rivals. It's set at a time when stage magicians were well paid and treated like rock stars. Angier is a smooth and polished American with considerable stage presence. Bale is a driven blue-collar type with brilliant and original ideas. Both become obsessed with their rivalry. Jackman enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to develop the ultimate magic trick. Unfortunately the results are unbelievable and spoil the movie.

The acting is top-notch with a number of scene stealing performances. Cutter (Michael Caine) helps both men at the start of their careers and later becomes a mentor to Jackman. Scarlett Johansson plays a beautiful assistant who sleeps with both men and ends up disliking both of them.

Jackman and Bale play ambitious Faustian characters willing to sell their souls to be the better magician. It's difficult to accept that two intelligent and rational humans could believe that their quest is worth the pain and sacrifice they inflict on others. Ultimately both characters seem flawed and somewhat delusional.",7
15 May 2007,One of the best,"Wow. I heard from this movie right after I heard Edward Norton was doing The Illusionist. As a huge fan of magicians, Edward Norton and Hugh Jackman my day couldn't possibly be better. I just had to see these movies.

First I watched the Illusionist. It was completely different than what I expected, but it was quite a nice movie. The Prestige however was totally as I expected and was absolutely perfect. The atmosphere it created was just wonderful.

The plot twists this movie has are just genius. Every time you think you understand whats happening, the plot twists and you have to think it all over again. That's, I think, the strength of this movie.

The performance of the actors was great, but thats not surprising when looking at all the big names ""Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine). They all are very convincing in their role and I think they did an excellent job.

Also the end is very satisfying. It ends very mysterious and you really want to know what's going on.

I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great movie. This is simply one of best.",10
3 January 2008,'Apracadabra',"Where do I begin...this movie is definitely one of my favorite top five films. Christopher Nolan directed this perfectly. When I first saw this on DVD I was just blown away. All the actors were outstanding in this film. The plot and story is really good. I was just sitting there watching with a grin on my face thinking in the back of my head: ""This is a good film"". I think that a portion of my fondness towards this film may be because that when I was watching it, the power went out and that just built up the suspense.

Overall. This film is a must see.

28 March 2009,"A good movie,maybe even great but still very overrated!","Prestige is a great movie.Christopher Nolan once more proved him self to be a great director.The acting is also very good an the best thing about it is probably the screenplay.However this movie most definitely doesn't deserves to be on eighty third place on 250 best movies ever made list.There are probably a hundred to two hundred movies that are better than this one.How can Prestige be better then The Deer Hunter or The Gladiator or Braveheart or Dances With Wolves or Meet Joe Black which is one of the most underrated movies of all time.There are also 2001: A Space Odyssey,Once Upon a Time in America,Full Metal Jacket,The Sting,Sin City,The Green Mile,Ben-Hur,Gone with the Wind,Gandhi,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Mystic River,Good Will Hunting,Rocky and many,many other's.

I can't really say anything bad about The Prestige except that it's overrated.Maybe it's not even overrated,i just think that there are definitely more than eighty movies that are better then this one.And even though it's a very intelligent,tensed and surprising movie that's not predictable,not one bit,i still think that it shouldn't be on the eighty third place! Sorry,i just don't! However,all i all,It's a good movie that you will surely enjoy watching.You will probably watch it more than once as i did.But still don't expect it to be the best movie you've ever seen cause it's definitely not.

Enjoy!!!",8
26 March 2010,Nolan at his Best,"Welcome to the world of magic. Nolan drives us through an unforgettable journey in the world of Passion (read as magic), Ego (tussle to outclass your competitor at any cost) and a thrilling cinematographic masterpiece which is here to stay. Chistopher Nolan is known more for his work in modern classics like Memento (2000) & the Batman series but this movie remains my personal favourite of his works. Michael Caine and Chritian Bale (both personal favourites of Nolan while casting) give an stellar performance yet again but the one who completely dazzled me in this one is Hugh Jackman. The man to man war between Jackman & Bale to outsmart each other in the magic tricks is a treat to watch. Scarlett Johannsson is pretty as always and gives good support to the men here.

The Non linear Story telling (which is trademark of Nolan's work) only adds to the suspense and beauty of this film. As the pages are unfold, It completely keeps you on the edge of your seats. I would definitely not like yo ruin your experience by leaking something out of the story. Watch out for the climax which completely left me dazzled personally.

The 1900's set up charismatically elevates the cinematic experience & the background score is dangerous for your nails (Pls don't bite ur nail while watching this :P). I rate this movie 10/10 as very few films have impressed me to this level. Good Work Nolan and keep it up. Eagerly waiting for your Inception (2010). I recommend this for everyone personally as this roller coaster ride through Nolan's vision is a rarity. Don't miss it at any cost.",10
8 July 2021,Magnificent Magicians in Period London,"I loved The Prestige. It was recommended to me by a close friend and did not disappoint. Everything for one's art is the ultimate theme. Then, what is art? The intertwining of Tesla and Edison with the fictional, but believable, characters makes this movie even more dynamic and fascinating. My favorite performance is Michael Caine. Ah, the pledge, the turn, the prestige. Thank you, Christopher Nolan.

30 July 2017,The Best Movie Ever Made,"I'm going to be specific. For God's shake, this movie captivated my attention since the very first image, the very first line. Every scene, every second of this wonderful movie is a stoned masterpiece that no one ever will top. The prove that this is the most stunning mind- blowing epic movie ever made is that after watching it for first, or second or third time (whatever), you try to understand the puzzle for a week. I seriously want to cry, because of this film, I will never watch something better. Thank you, Nolan. Long live the king.

22 October 2006,Seeing is Believing,"The ability to fool a large group of people. The power to force someone into seeing something. The art of illusion. Illusionists, magicians, no matter what they are called they consider themselves one thing; performers. To be the best means to work the hardest and to commit fully to an act. Sometimes, the illusion becomes too real.

How far will someone go for power? How much is enough? How far are you willing to go? In turn of the century London, filmmaker Christopher Nolan brings answers these questions and brings us into a world full of betrayal, murder, and of course, magic. Two rival magicians vie for power to see who really is the best. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) along with his associate Cutter (Sir Michael Caine) are puzzled by Robert's former colleague's latest trick. Alfred (Christian Bale) has unveiled a brilliant new illusion that defies expectation. Robert's assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) is willing to do anything for him, even infiltrate Alfred's act.

This feuding was the result of a trick gone wrong involving Robert's wife. Alfred appeared to be the one to blame and Robert never let it go. Rather than leaving the past behind, the two go back and forth to try and out perform the other on stage and off. What was once a friendship has turned into an all out war of secrets. Robert, who will give anything to outsmart his competitor, travels all the way to America to seek the help of a scientist and pull off the amazing trick his own way.

Nolan after the success of Batman Begins reunites with Bale and Caine to tackle a new setting. Nolan's previous works of notoriety, Memento and Insomnia, all have a similar edge to them. The Prestige is not different. The storyline is jumpy, going from present to the beginning, to the middle, and all over the place. Pieced together, the flow makes sense and is a joy to undertake.

With a solid script from Nolan and his brother Jonathon, all that was needed was a cast. Academy Award winner Caine, along with Jackman, Bale, Johansson, and a cameo by David Bowie, make The Prestige marvelous. Exceptional performances by Jackman and Bale make the rivalry intense and exciting.

The story strictly speaking is superb. The Nolan brothers have delivered once again. Their style and flow are truly original. It is hard to jump around in a film and pass on the message and information as cleanly as possible. The story leads up to a dramatic and climactic ending that will not soon be forgotten.

The Prestige is not a run of the mill birthday magic show. It is a fantastic voyage into the realm of magic, both the light the dark sides.",8

9 September 2008,Dark and brilliant,"For some reason I decided not to see this in the cinema and now I am really annoyed that I didn't. This is a brilliant film. Beautifully paced, complex and dark.

One of the reasons that I didn't go see it in the cinema is that I'm not a big fan of magic or steam punk but what this film is really about is the art and mind of the illusionist.

The twist in the story keeps itself hidden right to the end. The storyline despite being complex is wonderfully coherent as well. There are no unnecessary scenes in the whole film. It's very reminiscent of Fight Club in some ways.

I'd highly recommend this film to everyone.

8 June 2007,Truly Magical,"""The Prestige"" was box office magic, and for good reason. The film chronicles the brutal rivalry between two former friends, Angier (Hugh Jackamn) and Borden (Christian Bale). The story is set in 19th century Britain, and is a tale of magic, betrayal, greed, and trickery. So as not to spoil the plot, I'll focus on the acting and visuals, mostly. Angier is the more likable magician of the two rivals, and this is mainly due to the superb portrayal of him by Hugh Jackman. Jackman is not over-the-top, yet possesses an unwritten magic about him in this film. He turns in stellar work in a more restrained part than usual. Bale is effective and very good as Borden, but I found his character cruel and annoying. Still, he, like Jackamn, does very well with the proper accent. I just felt he was a bit too over-the-top at the wrong moments, and I felt for his wife.

Michael Caine plays the mentor of the two magicians, Cutter, and is absolutely superb. His voice is impeccable and easy to listen to, and I really liked his character. Scarlett Johansen, who usually plays trashy and useless roles, is actually very good in the film. She looks fantastic and plays her part just right, with a little bit of sass, but not too much. I also enjoyed the work of David Bowie and Andy Serkis as Tesla the scientist and his assistant.

The other magical part of ""The Prestige"" is the mood and visuals. The costumes are all pitch-perfect, making the time period obvious. The cinematography is gorgeous, always setting the mood in a kind of subtle way. Christopher Nolan gives the film the dark edginess it needs, and I was engrossed from the beginning.

All in all, the film is great. It has its minor flaws, but Christopher Nolan and the cast bring it alive in thrilling fashion. It's a great film for magic enthusiasts, but also for the general audience (I can't do a single magic trick). Go and rent it right now if you can, and you won't be disappointed!",8
4 January 2021,"Well well well, it's just 10/10","This Christopher Nolan classic never gets old. For me Chris truly broke away with this one and started his own league, this is his earliest film I rate 10/10 and it paved the way for the success to come later.

Even though it's based on a novel, I believe it's Chris' genius what has made this a masterpiece.

One of my favourite Michael Caine performances here as well, the dialogue is superb. It's well worth multiple viewings as every viewing uncovers something you missed prior. It's a very clever movie. Not for people with short attention spans and low IQ though. (like most Nolan movies)

14 March 2011,so mediocre,"Pretty but pointless. Jackman and Caine are very good as always, not too much to say about the others.

Like most Chris Nolan movies, seems good but emotionally empty. There should be more payoff for the tension, intensity and rough bits. And Christian Bale is such a tiresome blowhard, especially when he's not pretending to be America. God, what a stiff lipped high strung twit.

Perhaps there is more payoff towards the end than I anticipate, I couldn't stand the runaround the movie gives the viewer, so I watched only a portion of this 130min movie. It's a 'movie' for sure, mostly for empty entertainment purposes.

14 December 2006,"Clever, dark, haunting and competition to its deadliest..","The author of this storyline must have the most disturbed and brilliant mind ever! This story may be sci-fi, however, the issues that we could relate to, is astonishingly in abundance. Take the core of the movie - competition of magicians. It is a reality that you must have the better trick to lure more customers. In this phase of competition, it is called healthy competition. As time passes, you move onto the next phase - resent. This is the phase where you begin to figure ideas to eliminate the competitor. Then comes the final phase - obsession. From healthy to obsessed. Obsession is the phase where you go beyond competitive elimination - which is now dangerous and life-threatening. Just like the 3 stages of magic which was the theme of the movie - The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. These issues, although depicted in a sci-fi way, is very true in reality. Humans compete for business. Humans begin to try damaging other people's business. Humans begin to assassinate other people so they could have their turf for their business. We live in a very twisted world, and this movie is no different.

You can see here, that this movie could be depicted and interpreted in many ways. Obsession could be seen as a disease, slowly gnawing your life away, leaving marks at each milestone it eats. Just like the missing finger of Borden, and the injured leg of Angier. It is full of meaning, similes, metaphors. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and will blow your mind away. Every time you think about this movie, you seem to always think of something new, like I did with this comment above! I think this will be a classic, just like thrillers such as Seven. Dark, haunting and full of meanings.. the best psychological thriller of this era!",9
21 November 2006,If this doesn't sweep the boards at Oscars night...,"Quite simply, THE best movie of the year (closely followed by Rian Johnson's Brick). Intelligent, witty, excellently shot (a superb mix of breathtaking pans and establishing shots and very involving hand-held/steadi shots), with the finest actor of a generation (Caine) and very likely his successor (Bale).

No spoilers here, as unlike Memento,The Prestige's tricks can be worked out before they are revealed, and audiences will have great fun doing so. This is a tale of rival Victorian magicians, whose obsessions lead each into darker and darker places as Jackman's Angier seeks revenge for the death of his wife, and Bale's Borden looks to prove himself the better of the two magicians. Even without the mystery, twists and turns, this story is an excellent character study, something that carries the picture and at times supersedes the mystery and science fiction elements of the plot.

Like Memento, it has a non-linear narrative, though not such an extreme one...the narrative is played out in three stages, like the magic tricks within it - first the pledge, then the turn, finally the prestige. It can be followed easily enough by anybody with a decent attention span, and reaps great rewards for those who follow it closely enough to try and fathom its mysteries. As with magic, the trick is not what has been done, but HOW it has been accomplished.

Nolan is fast proving himself (along with David Lynch) the master of non-linear narrative film-making. His movies put the non-linear pretenders in their place (you know who you are), and shows that, even in this age of mass-consumption and dumbing down, movie audiences can be allowed to think, and don't need everything spelled out for them.

Can't wait for Oscars night, if this doesn't walk home with a few (Nolan particularly, Bale and Caine) then there is NO JUSTICE!!!",10

19 March 2007,Not terribly mysterious; too many twists,"The prestige, we're told, is the third and final part of a magic act, the one in which the twists and turns occur, the denouement of the act. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Apparently magicians analyze and study their craft endlessly, trying to improve, compete, excel, and dominate. The Prestige is about two lifelong competing magicians in 1900s London who are constantly trying to discover each other's secrets. Eventually, as they top each other, there's death, perhaps murder, placing everyone they know in mortal danger.

Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is the showman, the magician with a flair for the dramatic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is the moody technician with the creativity and intelligence to pull off the most remarkable stunts. They would seem to be fine complements for each other, but each is so set on beating the other that all pretense of camaraderie is abandoned.

What follows, of course, is a couple hours of twists and turns, with so and so turning out to not be what he or she was purported to be. One of Angier's tricks goes horribly awry, and Borden is blamed for the result and is jailed. Is he guilty? How did he accomplish it? Linking the two masters is the aged Cutter (Michael Caine), who's been training them both since they were just starting out. A veteran of the gritty, no-holds-barred magic world, Cutter Knows Things. With a glint in his eye and a crusty grin, he reminded me more of Long John Silver, except without the eye path or the walking stick. Nothing like a crusty ol' sage to keep everyone in check, right? The heart of the animosity between Angier and Borden is that it's thought that Borden somehow was responsible for the death of Angier's wife during their act. Then Borden goes on to fame and fortune while Angier has nothing. Even Borden's tricks kick the ass of Angier's tricks, so much so that the latter journeys to, of all places, Boulder, Colorado in the United States to seek out Nicholas Tesla (well played by David Bowie), who'd built a funky device for Borden to use in his own act. All that's missing is Angier shouting, ""Vengeance will be mine!"" Enter Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), a trollop/assistant who joins Angier's act. They fall in love, surprisingly. (That sentence brought to you by the word ""sarcasm."") Meanwhile, Borden falls in love with HIS assistant and knocks her up. So it's sort of like real life.

Perhaps where the movie really lost me is in its science - one must suspend quite a bit of disbelief in order for key parts of the film to be acceptable. That's one of the risks of a story about magic; modern audiences know a lot more about science than did those at the turn of the last century, so there'd be much more skepticism. If Angier's trick were shown today, people would have myriad guesses as to what really happened, whereas in the 1900s it was all magic and wonder and crap like that. Still and all, the way in which Angier accomplishes his trick seems like a shaggy dog - it's in the story merely to move the plot along.

I like movies with twists and turns, but when there are so many of them I no longer know what's right and what's wrong, I kind of lost interest in the movie. I hate not knowing which way is up, because when the credibility of each character - and, by extension, their own reality - is called into question, then the viewer has nothing to go by, and truly Anything can happen. Which makes me wonder what the point really is.

On the plus side, you have the subtext of Batman (Bale) versus Wolverine (Jackman). Even Alfred from Batman is there (Caine). And both actors are pretty good, but the movie plods along in places. I've never really liked Bale, though, who has a giant head.

See The Illusionist instead, a movie covering some of the same ground but more effectively and believably, with scarce, credible turns.",6
23 March 2019,Perfection !!!,"One of my favorite films and one of my favorite actors starring in it. The film is one of the best movies that in ever created about magic. The movie perfectly gives the atmosphere of the 19th century in London. The clothes the environment, everything is great. also the plot is very interesting and appealing. One of the things that I adore about this movie is that it hast a twisted plot. You can watch it hundreds of time, but you will never fully understand the film and with every time you watch you find a new detail that you have not seen before which adds to your understanding of the film's idea. In one word, this movie has everything. The action, the intrigue, the fear, the magic, the betrayal, everything. It has interesting plot and one of the best actors. And I will recommend everyone watching it.

10 August 2022,Man's Reach exceeds his Grasp,"The movie leaves you gasping for breath act after act, with its spectacular twists and characters that crave superiority over each other, revenge and most importantly, fame. The emotional conflicts for both the main characters are the main reasons for their respective character arcs and their acting really exceeds expectations. This is a classic Nolan film right from his signature non-linear storytelling down to his jaw dropping twists and mind bending ending that really elevate this movie. A 9 only because of Scarlett Johanssen's character and her unnecessarily revealing clothing but a masterpiece otherwise.

2 November 2007,How the mighty fall,"Sure, it's clever, but not clever enough. ""The Prestige"" falls behind high expectations raised by the filmmakers' track record, by stunning trailers and a magnificent poster that would grace any museum wall. Unfortunately, the key plot device is predictable from half-way through at the latest. But then, Wally Pfister's masterful cinematography is compelling all by itself. Also, perhaps one shouldn't complain when a movie gives you David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. The script sure strikes the chord of truth when it calls him ""not a magician, but a real wizard"". In my book, that's as accurate a description of Tesla as it is of Bowie. From what I've seen of the Nolan brothers' work, I wish they stuck to their own screenplays like they did in ""Memento"". Having said that, I still can't wait for ""The Dark Knight"". If anyone can teach that old bat some new tricks, it's Christopher Nolan.

30 October 2012,The prestige,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

6 November 2006,One of the best of the year,"""The Prestige"" is a film about two magicians who are friends at first but when a tragedy strikes, the two split up and have their own magic acts. A rivalry begins between them and from there, the movie twists and turns like a windy road.

The acting is the strongest point of the film. Jackman and Bale are both charismatic and extremely likable, although I'll admit I was cheering for Bale (Who wasn't? :P). The plot is well developed and some have complained about the length but when you have a good movie playing, you don't notice the time. Once the movie grabs you, it doesn't let go.

Definitely worth the admission price. Go see it, tell your friends, and you'll thank me later.

24 October 2006,Well worth the money,"I had seen a number of reviews of The Prestige and they were all giving it an extremely high rating, even from reviewers who are notorious for giving low ratings, so I went into this movie with very high expectations and was not disappointed. There is plenty of time for character-building as the movie runs over 2 hours, but do not fear, this movie is not filled with ""filler material."" From the opening credits to the final credits, you are enthralled with what is happening on screen. This is not a high-action movie, but it does contain tense scenes that get you to sit on the edge of your seat. As the final credits began, the theatre that I was in broke out into spontaneous applause, something that I have only experienced with one other movie (and that was a premiere night).

The movie centers around two rival magicians who are friends at the beginning of the movie, but due to an unfortunate incident, they become bitter rivals. They then seek to ""better"" each other as they develop the ""ultimate"" trick. The movie takes place in turn of the century London and is very pleasurable to watch.

With so many movies coming out these days, it is difficult to pick one from the rest, but The Prestige jumps out as one that should be seen. BUT be warned ...this movie has a number of twists and you should be careful of what you read or listen to prior to watching it. If the twists are revealed .. it would certainly spoil the experience for you.",9
17 February 2007,Now Thats a Christopher Nolan Film...,"The Prestige, aptly suited for the title...you can not ignore it. The word Prestige itself means the final part/act of the magic trick, and the film ends with a well crafted ending. I have not read the novel, by Christopher Priest, but then the picturization is complete in itself...at least for me.

To what limits can a man go to take revenge...or for the ultimate magic trick. The film is a carefully woven tale of two magicians and their rivalry, and is something that keep you glued to your seats right till the end. Now thats some storytelling. A must see for Nolan's fan and I just kept thinking, how does he do it. The Memento and Batman Begins fame director/screenplay writer at his best again. The way his films are directed, the manner in which story is told always keeps you captivated and there is certainly no escaping this one. Go ahead and see for yourself for the ultimate magic trick...

11 November 2017,Great performance.,"It's best to not reveal anything about the plot as it's not fun to ruin the moment, just like magic tricks. Instead, I'll mention a few things about The Prestige. Go with the open mind, and I'll promise you love it.

The Prestige is well directed and written (you can thank Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for that). While I haven't read the original novel, apparently Christopher Priest was completely surprised by what he was seeing, so I can guess that anyone, who has read the original novel, will like this movie too. Excellent cast. Everyone gave their best, but I did find Andy Serkis a bit weird but you can't blame him. You already know where his fame came from and you can't unsee it. Other than that, no complaints. You can see Nolan likes to use same actors in his movies. I do think that maybe Christian Bale was the best actor, and I'm not surprised by that. The man knows how to give a good performance. Hugh Jackman was also good. It's always a relief that he has a talent to play roles that aren't Wolverine (not that he was bad in it, he's great) This movie isn't special effect heavy as other movies directed by Nolan but you can compare it to Memento, despite the differences in themes. Just like Memento, it's more of a thriller and drama than an action movie.

The Prestige does show a pretty convincing impression of the end of the 19th century. No CGI backgrounds that look bland. The editing, music and cinematography is standard good quality you would expect.

There were a few moments which I did find questionable, and as something that could break the suspension of disbelief. Luckily, I wasn't bothered that much and those moments were only a few.

I don't want to give too much credit to Nolan brothers as I don't want to discredit anyone else that were involved in the movie but if you like their work, I'm 100% sure that you will like this movie just like the others. It may require a repeated viewing to some people but I don't consider it a bad thing. I highly recommend The Prestige.",9
25 March 2021,Not as Great as People Make it Out to Be,"This movie wasn't something that I planned on reviewing before, but after my parents and I saw it I couldn't help myself. The wheels in my head turned like clockwork as I saw the film.

To tell you the truth, the biggest reason behind why we saw ""The Prestige"" was because one of the trailers that came with it on Amazon Prime made it look so exciting! That, and the involvements of stars like Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johannsson, Michael Caine, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis got our interest hook, like, and sinker.

To the surprise of my family and I, though...the film turned out to be an enormous disappointment! And that's even in stark contrast to the positive reception it received ever since its release in theaters.

The only positives I managed to note were how impressive the performances of the cast were. I deeply admired that the performers were giving their all no matter what, and they fit their parts like a glove. The most enrapturing of the cast members were that of Michael Caine as John Cutter and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. Although I will admit that I can't help but wish that Bowie had a larger role and greater amount of screen time than what he was given.

Other than that, the film just wasn't all that great.

For instance, outside of John Cutter and Nikola Tesla, the characters were boring, unlikable, and unmemorable. Especially that of Robert Angier, Alfred Borden, and Olivia Wenscombe, who were played by Jackman, Bale, and Johansson. Several times, I noted that the three characters went through some development throughout the movie. But, the direction the film was ultimately taking Robert, Alfred, and Olivia in ultimately made their growth worthless and caused them to be all-the-more infuriating. It doesn't help that there was little to no sense of redemption from any of the three characters, because the rivalry between Robert and Alfred lasted until one magician went down and the other won.

The overall direction by Christopher Nolan, and the screenplay by him and Jonathan Nolan, weren't my cup of tea either.

As a whole, the film was openly befuddling and unexpectingly slow. It was frankly not as exciting as the trailer made it out to be, the trailer in question actually being quite misleading because it gave the impression that it was going to be about a regular magician facing off against another who was dabbling in dark magic. And because of how much of the focus was put on the petty rivalry between the two magicians, the narrative neither developed or took off. In addition to this, it felt like there was a vast potential that the movie just wasn't able to grasp, the potential in question being what my family and I were hoping the film would be based on the trailer. The ending was likewise very disappointing, because just when things were going to be heading in a likable path thanks to Robert finally seeming like he was realizing the errors he caused everything abruptly fell flat on its face thanks to Alfred killing Robert and him turning out to be alive. The themes of the movie were pretty much wasted, if I may add. The particular reason for why I'm saying this is because there were no morals for the characters to learn by in the long run. If the Nolan brothers really were trying to show that getting wrapped in your obsessions is truly a bad thing, they certainly didn't do a good job at getting that message across.

In the end, aside from the performers showcasing phenomenal portrayals, the film as a whole was a waste at the most. It was confusing, slow, and it held no moral value either.",4
7 November 2006,Brilliantly written and executed,"I heard from a friend who saw this that this was the most brilliant made movie she had ever seen, and she couldn't seem to emphasize that enough. That was enough to get me to see it in the theater (which i rarely do). This was easily worth the price of admission. The plot line is genius and keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. Even if you guess one of the twists in this movie, you will probably find that you overlooked 1 or 2 more that you didn't see coming at all! This movie was so good, I went to the theater two days later and saw it again. It's wonderful the second time, too. Maybe about as good as the first time. I noticed more and more very smart aspects of the movie the second time that I didn't catch the first. I didn't know it was a Christopher Nolan film (Memento, Batman Begins) until after I watched it, which didn't surprise me as his work has always impressed me in the past, and continues to. If you haven't yet seen this, go see it!!! you wont regret it!

8 July 2007,Disappointing,"Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. ""The Prestige,"" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no ""Memento""; it's not even a ""Batman Begins.""

What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.

The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity.

6/10. A big disappointment.",6

30 January 2009,An intelligent and entertaining film,"Over the past few years, there have been many movies which proved that is possible to combine both action and a good storyline. The Prestige is a clear example of that.

Christopher Nolan has made a very good movie that doesn't get boring at any time, and keeps you awaiting for more. The script is great, and the acting doesn't disappoint. Christian Bale is definitely the one who gives the best performance. Nevertheless, the rest of the cast does a pretty good job as well.

It gives a clear definition of what the world of magic is made off.

If you haven't see it yet, I strongly recommend you to do so.

23 May 2008,One Of The Best Movies Every Made (PERIOD),"I may be 16, but I have seen countless films and have a habit of forgetting the good ones and only retaining my memories of the not so good ones. But I cannot remember any film where I have been on the edge of my seat. With every scene, and the acting of the cast taking my breath away.

With likes of ""Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and a cameo from (DAVID BOWIE)"" on the bill you cannot fault this film. If there is any film that should be remembered for ever more, it should be this one. I doubt very much I will come across a film on par with this for many years.

All I can say is take a couple of hours out and see this as you will be astonished !!!!!!!

22 February 2011,Entertaining - but slightly overheated - mishmash of Victorian period melodrama and science fiction.,"Two Victorian London magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson) become involved in professional rivalry which has dramatic and far-reaching consequences for both of them.

Magic is by its nature being able to appear to bend the rules of nature and/or physics - while, in reality, being no more able to do so than you or I.

Equally the role of an intelligent viewer is to try and guess and predict the unexplained, the how, or the hidden twist (if you believe there might be one). A film which is allowed to take both feet of the floor (more literally than metaphorically!) destroys all such audience games.

You can't knock Michael Caine for his supporting roles, because he plays them so well. Jackson and Bale are both overheated and a bit hysterical, and besides which, professional rivals tend not to hate each other deep down. There is - again deep down - a respect and admiration for the skill of the other.

Here, for the purpose of the plot and a does of extra drama, this relationship has to turn murderous. This film could have survived, and be even been better, with a bit less plot and a bit more breathing in the dusty backstage atmosphere of the music hall.

(And very well created it is - the art direction is simply superb.)

Feel for female lead Scarlett Johansson, not a lot to do and almost window dressing in this production. I will watch her career with interest, (which red-blooded male wouldn't?) when she has more to do than looking good in an assistant's costume.

While entertained and involved I have to say this is a lesson more in what the audience is prepared to accept than it is a cleverly crafted film script. Many films contain nonsense and illogical developments, but this doesn't lay its cards out on the table early enough. You can't switch formats mid-film.

In many ways, it is a form of cheating. Or more accurately a case of ""wouldn't it be good if only.....""",7

27 November 2006,Crap Covered Pretzel with Sweet Glaze,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now that you wouldn't be missing all that much if you didn't see this movie. It tries to pass itself as historical fiction, pertaining to a time period in which magicians were willing to do anything to usurp their fellow illusionists, but at the end it dabbles much too far into the realm of impossibility-explained-with-science that it effectively ruins itself and drops down to the uninteresting ""sci-fi"" category.

For about the first two hours, it was what I expected. A dark, mysterious, captivating, and twisted piece of storytelling. I've come to associate each of those elements with director Christopher Nolan and his oddly familiar castChristian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, and Scarlett Johansson. But at some point during the course of the above-average directing and acting, the writer messed up. I don't want to give away too much, but it effectively ruins the greatest magic trickthe Transported Manfrom the movie. It became convoluted. It tried so hard to be darker, more mysterious, more captivating, and more twisted, that it eventually turned itself into a pretzel. A crap covered one.

The final scenes made an attempt to fix up the original mess by delivering a punch that was actually thought-provoking. Still, you could pass this one up until it comes out on PPV or Blockbuster. Don't pay full price, unless you're a big ""Batman Begins"" fan and need something to satisfy your taste buds until ""The Dark Knight"" is released in 2008.",4

23 May 2022,crème de la crème,"I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan for a long time, ever since Memento. The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. The Prestige is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever watched in my life. Christopher Nolan, never fails to amazes me. The unpredictability of the movie is very rare now in movies, a lot of plot twists, including Tesla. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman delivers with their astonishing performances, besides of course the great Michael Caine. There will never be a movie alike, and I'll surely recommend this movie for everybody.

28 May 2007,Every great magic trick consists of three acts,"The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. In this particular case, the audience is shown nothing less than Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale displaying their magical acting and accompanied by a magic deck with cards so valuable as Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie.

The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. The magician goes by the name of Christopher Nolan, and his something extraordinary is the filming of this movie, which captivates from the very beginning: the settings, the pace, the staging, everything is managed in a way the audience will but get hooked.

Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. True. But if what you never saw before comes to be some ""Deus ex machina"" sleight of hand, part of the audience shall feel cheated; and all the previous work, though highly remarkable, will end up being part of a trick that lacks ""the prestige"".",4
6 March 2008,"Great Story, Great Acting, 10 Stars","First of all it really has to be said that Christian Bale is a god amongst men, at least in front of a camera. He always seems to deliver an intense performance on an intense script, and I'm talking without fail. If you've seen American Psycho, Batman Begins, or Equilibrium will understand that Bale almost always ends up playing a serious and obsessive character. This movie is no exception. Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you. Hugh Jackman actually delivers an uncharacteristically good performance in this movie, he easily matched Bale. It really was perfect casting. So I haven't really described the storyline but that little sentence earlier is all I'm willing to say because this movie has an amazing twist which I don't want to ruin. All I will say is ""complete dedication to your art..."" 10 stars no question!

I am glad to see so many people enjoying a film that has at least a modicum of smarts to it. I enjoyed this picture for its performances and its intelligence. I genuinely did not know where this picture was going to go, and it held my interest the entire time. I had a good time at the movies with this one, and I hope you do, too.

1 November 2019,Nolan Shines once agian,"Christopher Nolan has yet again proved that he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time but I think this might just be his best work.I couldn't find a single flaw in the movie. I tried to nitpick was much as I could but I just couldn't. The movie hot do good that I literally started laughing by how good the film truly was. This film is a must for any film lover and don't miss out on this perfection.

28 November 2006,The Obsession,"On the surface this movie was about a rivalry between two magicians to prove who was best at his craft. But deeper than that lied love, revenge, and obsession over their craft.

""The Prestige"" was about two magicians that were once partners and a tragic accident made them bitter adversaries. This movie, like a good magician, held my attention throughout. The two magicians were constantly trying to one-up each other to the point that they would sabotage each others act. Even though I thought the rivalry was a bit juvenile, I still wanted to see what each of them would come up with next to outdo the other.

These two were so utterly obsessed with their craft that they risked life and limb to be the best. They were entrenched in a battle with each other so fierce that the ending could only be tragic unless they both woke up and realized the perilous path they were upon.

I gave the movie high marks for its story and its successful attempts to captivate me and hold my attention until the end.",8
1 July 2019,The Prestige,"This is one of my favourite films. It is full of twists and turns and ends in an unexpected way. No matter how many times i watch the prestige i pick up on something new hidden within the story.

This is an amazing film that will get you thinking and wondering about how it is done.

7 November 2021,Two Magicians Engaged in a Deadly Rivalry,"This film essentially begins in the late 19th Century with a magician by the name of ""John Cutter"" (Michael Caine) performing his tricks on stage in London. With him are two apprentices ""Robert Angier"" (Hugh Jackman) and ""Alfred Borden"" (Christian Bale). Also working with John Cutter is his beautiful assistant ""Julia McCullough"" (Piper Perabo) who also happens to be Robert Angier's wife. It's during one of these stage performances that Julia accidentally dies and Robert immediately accuses Alfred of negligence as the cause for it. From that point on a fierce rivalry begins which is only exacerbated when the two of them branch off to form acts of their own not long afterward. What neither of them realize at the time, however, is just how serious and deadly this rivalry will eventually become. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a number of twists and turns but the one at the end was completely unexpected and something that really startled me. Admittedly, some of the scenes were a bit too dark at times but all things considered I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

24 March 2022,"Amazing movie on every level, but one.....","Honestly, I truly do love this movie and all the performers in it. Everything is exceptionally well done from cinematography to the acting and everything in between. However, put aside all the wonderfulness about this movie and cut right into the heart of the subject. It's a spoiled rich boy never told no. Obsessing about revenge for his wife's death by his competitor's arrogance. And especially refusing to accept the simple answer everyone was telling him. These key bits are crafted into an engaging story about obsession, revenge, competition, and the level of sacrifices only the best are willing to make to be the best.

28 October 2006,"Memento (10/10), Batman Begins (10/10), Prestige (You do the Math)","WOW! It's been a long time since we've seen a decent film that excels in almost all aspects. Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, to name a few, were all just amazing. Then again after Memento and Batman Begins...could we've expected anything less from ace director Christopher Nolan. The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads. I must say...one of the best films I've seen! 10/10

22 October 2006,"Not Today, Double Fantasy","Greetings again from the darkness. Comparisons with ""The Illusionist"" will abound as both are 19th century pieces centering on England's fascination with magicians and illusionists during that period. Although the settings are similar, it is important to note that ""The Illusionist"" is at its core a love story, while ""The Prestige"" is the tale of dueling illusionists and their fierce, even deadly, competition to be known as the BEST.

Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are the competing masters of illusion and after an onstage accident caused by Bale causes the death of Jackman's true love, the quest for best takes off on tangents that few could predict. To help confuse the issue, another master of illusion directs the film! Christopher Nolan brings his warped ""Memento"" twists and turns to us so that we, as viewers, are left floundering at what the next trick will be.

The cast includes Michael Caine in a pretty strong role and Scarlett Johansson, who is given little to do other than squeeze into an assistant's costume and wear gobs of lipstick. There are nice turns from Piper Perabo (""Coyote Ugly""), Andy Serkis (""LOTR"", ""King Kong"") and David Bowie (yes, THAT David Bowie) as world renowned scientist Tesla, who himself is in a competition with Thomas Edison.

Although many of the plots twists are pretty easy to see coming, it is nonetheless a joyous ride for those of us who enjoy a wild screenplay. And it must be noted that Bale is just outstanding as his brooding and near mystical presence adds a great deal to the film. So chalk up another victory for Mr. Nolan, and please don't give away any of the fun to those who have not seen the film.",8
22 October 2006,One of the best movies I've seen this year...,"I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent.

17 August 2007,Observation that irks me but still a great film,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

23 October 2006,Brilliant,"""The Prestige"" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in ""plot fillers"" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a ""T"" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford.

Two days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images. Excellent.

31 July 2023,I did not care too much for the revelation toward the end.,"(2006) The Prestige THRILLER/ MYSTERY DRAMA

Adapted from the novel by Christopher Priest, co-produced, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan with Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) a magician married to Julia (Piper Perabo) along with his assistant/ box jumper Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) has just moved to a new town, magic is the main attraction seeking for employment along with Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) they start off as apprentices/ proteges for Cutter (Michael Caine) until they compete with one another with a revelation toward the end. I thought the overall tone was too dark, grim and cared more for Robert and cared for the Christian Bale character even less.

21 October 2006,Incredibly complex plot that will keep you guessing until the last seconds of film.,"The Prestige was an incredibly deep and twisted film. The plot is fairly hard to follow and for I while I would think things like ""is this the past or the present"" but soon I realized that it didn't really matter what it was, because in the end everything comes together. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing, right up until the last seconds of the film. These last few seconds will make you say ""Wow, I get it now"" and you will realize that Innocent scenes earlier in the film have significant importance. The special effects are great and the acting is very well done. The movie draws many parallels with another recently released ""magician"" film - The Illusionist, but the action and intensity of The Prestige makes for a more exciting and enjoyable experience. A backstage view of how some magic tricks are done also adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of admission.

31 August 2013,Startling Magician Story.,"Christopher Nolan directs this imaginative, original, and quite unpredictable story of two rival magicians(played effectively by Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman) who escalate their rivalry when Jackman's wife dies, and blames Bale for it. This leads to increasingly daring magic tricks, each trying to sabotage the other, until a double-twist ending that no one saw coming...

Film also fictionalizes a meeting with real inventor Tesla, who had experimented with new power sources and electricity, but was largely forgotten by history. In this story, he invents a machine that both magicians covet, but which doesn't work according to plan.

Densely plotted but mesmerizing and superbly crafted story ends on a most surprising yet satisfying note. Just like a real magic trick, its all about deception and misdirection, so pay attention!

6 October 2015,Masterful deceit,"I remember vividly going to see ""The Prestige"" upon release - the mesmerizing twists, the movie almost folding in on itself - but it becomes more apparent on further viewings just how well constructed this movie really is. The rivalry between these two fanatics goes to some scary lengths; and even though I usually gravitate towards Hugh Jackman in this story, it's evident that Christian Bale is the more obsessive in his stagecraft (which might just be the difference in the two characters rather than the actors). I love the unfurling of this story and its Victorian setting, and it's still one of my favorite Nolan movies. But the real cherry on top, the real thrill is when (and how) they inject Nikola Tesla into the proceedings. It says a lot (negatively) that this is the most we've seen of this man in the past ten years, and he truly does need more exposure. But either way, as soon as he enters the picture, it's like ""BOOM!"" the movie enters a whole new strata. And Bowie's an inspired choice for the role.

Killer movie.

8/10",8
24 August 2009,Shakespearian in both scope and quality,"If the script for The Prestige was found in Shakespeare's house, it would credibly be accepted as his work. It is firmly based in period facts, and goes beyond them. It has the gorgeous talent of allegory, appealing to all, and to each at different levels. If you follow them all, the movie will bring a shiver to your spine when, as layers of reality, each as real as the next, are peeled away in this shrewed screen play, revealing men and man, women and woman, tragedy and joy.

So many fragments of the story mirror others: wife's and partners and girl-friends and Daedalus-like science... yet the film holds them all clear in mind. The film itself is finely crafted: gorgeous detailed sets reward the eye, and multiple viewings.

The casting is perfect: Bale at his driven, rather than simply raging best. Jackman, so brilliantly failed and jealous, Scarlet and Rebecca hall, in a partnership completely distinct from VIcky Cristina, but which must surely have alerted Woody Allen's eye.

David Bowie is perfect and his own fame helps convey Tesla's own struggle with being ahead of his time. The presence of Andy Serkis (You MUST see him in Einstein and Eddington) is becoming a code for must-see movie.

This is, simply, one of the best movies of the decade.",10
21 February 2007,"The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige: We see what we want to see","Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have collaborated on previous projects (namely the brilliant MEMENTO) and here take on Christopher Priest's dazzling novel THE PRESTIGE. Where MEMENTO kept the audience tense and on the edge of the seat and of quizzical mind, THE PRESTIGE attempts to use the same techniques but ends up being an overly long, at times ponderous, and ultimately rather bland examination of illusion and magic and the need audiences have to believe in what they see as an exit route from the mundane lives they lead.

The time is turn of the century England (with a foray into the United States) when Magic Shows were a popular form of entertainment (as they still are in Las Vegas). Two friends - Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman) - are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks. The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman. Their rivalry is healthy until an unfortunate illusion/trick fails at the hands of Borden and the loss of the beloved assistant of Angier. From this point the two friends become archenemies, each sworn to discover the secrets of the other, a journey which eventually leads to murder and the ultimate illusion of life over death.

There are so many subplots that they defy summation. Suffice it to say that inventors (electricity scientist Nikola Telsa - David Bowie), magic machine creators (Cutter - Michael Caine), wives (Julia Angier - Piper Perabo and Sarah Borden - Rebecca Hall), lovers (Olivia - Scarlett Johansson) all weave in and out of the plot, at times illuminating the ideas and at times confusing them. The ending is predictable: it is the only way to explain the Transported Man secret trick. Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast. The production values are what really make the film work. Worth an evening's viewing - a long evening... Grady Harp",8
9 December 2020,Stellar,"While a lot of other Christopher Nolan movies get more hype and credit, for my money this is his best film. Intricate, perfectly scripted and paced, with a solid cast and a satisfying and surprising ending, it's truly a marvel.

Give it a go.

23 October 2006,"Lacks substance, but is so much fun you won't care too much","Not as good as Memento or Nolan's first film, Following, but thankfully much better than last summer's Batman Begins (never saw Insomnia). Nolan goes back to the mystery / suspense genre with this tale of two rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) who compete with each other, sometimes viciously. The film lives on its twists and turns, so it's not a good idea to spoil any of the plot. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. It's always fun, and I always was eager to see what came next. The twists and secrets are generally pretty good, though one of the story's biggest secrets becomes painfully obvious too early on. I think most of the audience will begin to recognize Nolan's very obvious attempt at sleight of hand whenever a particular character's face is on camera for more than a handful of frames. That doesn't harm the entertainment value too much. What I would have liked, and what I think would have made the film much more memorable, is a bit more emotional involvement. The characters are universally two-dimensional here. They're all just a cipher for the plot. The movie had absolutely no thematic complexity, either. Neither one of these things that it lacks is particularly far from its grasp. And without complex characters or themes, the film is just a ""Wow, this is cool!"" rather than a ""What is it that I just experienced?"" I know that, to so many in the IMDb community, that's the same thing, but it really isn't. I do think Nolan succeeded at finding depth with Memento, but he certainly hasn't here. Still, I'm satisfied with it just being a cool popcorn movie.",8
12 May 2018,Pulls off quite a few illusions of its own.,"'The Prestige (2006)' is a movie about illusions that manages to pull off quite a few of its own, with Nolan competently using cinematic techniques as a form of slight-of-hand. It cryptically tells you its many twists in its opening moments yet still manages to surprise with them. Yet, beyond the twists and turns lies a layered narrative centred around two well-crafted characters, one that impacts emotionally as well as intellectually. It is often forgotten amidst the plethora of Nolan's other work, but it sits just as highly as them and is, in my book, even a little underrated. 8/10

2 April 2007,A real magician tries to invent something new...,"...and that is exactly what what Christopher Nolan has done with this wonderful piece of conjured magic. In 2000 he amazed the viewing audience with his wonderful Momento and...trust me...this is equally as good if not better! Christian Bale shows us once more that his Reign of Fire days are well and truly behind him as he puts in a dazzling performance as the moody and slightly arrogant Alfred Borden, who triggers a series of hate fuelled events when his hunger to make tricks seem more dangerous causes the death of his colleague's wife. His former colleague, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), then sets out to destroy not only Borden's career but his whole life along with it. The pair are quickly caught up in a 'punch-for-punch' type battle which, it soon becomes very clear, will not have a happy ending. Also, credit to Michael Caine for his calming performance of Cutter who seeks to help Angier succeed but yet at the same time shows, by contrast to himself, just how enraged both characters of Borden and Angier are becoming in the battle.

What Nolan has done is not only created a visually beautiful movie with his Victorian era setting but also shown us what lengths man can be driven to through competition in a way which can be related even to the present day. However, the end of the movie will not please everyone as it takes a huge jump in the science fiction direction. I however loved where he went, and I think that anyone who has even the slightest glimmer of imagination will too.

A lot of people have compared this to another movie of 2007, The Illusionist. Don't! This is David Copperfield, whereas The Illusionist is Paul Daniels. A must see of 2007!",10
12 January 2007,"Really now, DO watch closely!","All I really want to say is that Christopher Nolan is The King of the little details in modern cinema. And the mixture of talent and perfectionism in this film/guy is close to frightening. So watch very very close (to be read as: ""Watch the movie AT LEAST one more time"") and you will be deeply and utterly rewarded. Another thing is the brilliant cast. Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy. What you will also experience is a masterly Nolan-blend between reality and mysticism.

Thousand thumbs up for a genius at play! 10/10

11 February 2023,"An Intricate and Twisting Storyline, Exceptional Directing by Nolan and Acting by Jackman and Bale","The Prestige by Christopher Nolan and starring Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine follows two rival magicians, as they engage in a bitter and dangerous battle of wits and deception.

The film's direction is excellently done, Nolan effectively keeps building tension throughout and it really kept me on the edge of my seat with his masterful use of misdirection and twists. The cinematography is also great, with Wally Pfister perfectly capturing the film's dark and brooding atmosphere.

The acting is also top-notch, with Jackman and Bale delivering astounding performances as the rival magicians while Michael Caine, as the mysterious engineer Cutter, provides excellent support and adds another layer of depth to the film's already rich cast.

The film's intricate and twisting storyline, combined with its excellent performances and masterful direction, has made it one of the best modern psychological thrillers.

21 July 2019,Only perfectly crafted,"""The Prestige"" is an excellent movie from the technical standpoint (except for his score, but I will refer to this later): Bale and Jackman in particular gave a great performance and Nolan is really good as usual. The film is interesting mostly because of the intricated structure of his plot, where the Nolan brothers have fun in crossing the flow of time over and in changing constantly who to root for. But unfortunately I have to say that it has, in my opinion, poor emotional weight. ""The Prestige"" is listed as a thriller but I didn't feel the suspense, except for two scenes. And also his ambiguous nature about the protagonist doesn't help, because the real protagonist is the fight that I didn't find that exciting. But for this issue the worst thing is the score. It isn't bad at all, but it isn't nothing. I hardly remember a point in a film where it played and I am almost convinced that the movie was scoreless. For someone it may not be an issue but I think a score is useful when it enters your brain and enriches the scene, not when it is hardly listened. ""The Prestige"" is a very well crafted movie that hasn't the emotional weight that could bring it from a good movie to an excellent one.",7
22 April 2015,Prestigious,"If you are a fan of surprises, twists and turns then this movie is for you. The movie in itself is magic. You couldn't predict the next two scenes if you tried.

A classic Christopher Nolan piece with Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman at their very best. In my opinion Nolan should have clinched an Oscar for directing this film as his interpretation of the novel was fantastic with his usual awesome add-ons of course.

Another reason why i rated this movie 10/10 was because of Bale's sublime performance. He has collaborated with Nolan on previous projects and i have enjoyed every single one of them. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves suspense as there is a lot of unpredictability in here.

Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as rival illusionists Borden and Angier. They were friends who worked together, until an unfortunate incident made them enemies. Now they are competing in the world of magic, and intentionally ruining each other's shows.

Most of the film takes place in the past, telling us about the troubled relationship between the two men, in the midst of an investigation into Angier's death. Oops, spoiler? Nope, no spoiler. The film starts with Angier's death, and then traces the events leading to that moment. 'The Prestige' is a stylish mystery thriller, with plenty of thrills and twists. As with magic, nothing is what it seems and you have to pay very close attention. It also effectively illustrates human obsession. Both men in turn are the protagonist, and the antagonist.

Michael Caine stars as Cutter, the man who invents the gadgets for Angier's illusions. Borden's main trick is The Transported Man, which Borden invented. Angier copies the trick to the best of his ability. However, Angier still doesn't know how Borden does his trick, and Angier and Cutter are trying to unravel the mystery of this trick.

The trick is also the center of the movie, and has to be kept in mind when the film ends on a bit of a confusing note. If you've paid very close attention to the movie from the start, everything will make sense. Nothing here happens by chance. This is a brilliant script, very well acted by seasoned actors, and it is visually great, as well.",7
5 January 2008,"A Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful movie!","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

23 October 2006,"Worst movie about magic, EVER!","This movie was terrible. Based on the talent including the director I expected a lot more than what I got. I was tired and this movie put me to sleep. Batman was pure genius, but I now have to wonder if Nolan is capable of making a solid move that doesn't revolve around deception or confusion like Momento.

The acting wasn't impressive and the plot is almost a complete mirror of The Ilusionist. We are staving for a good story, but it appears that people like Nolan, and that cat that did The Departed have to rely on their fan base to hype projects that are not worth the price of admission.

I'd say skip this all together, the only magic you will see is $20 disappearing from your pocket.

11 September 2010,Batman vs Wolverine,"One of my favorite movie from Christopher Nolan, but what can I say the guy is a brilliant director. This film literally has style and substance, the plot with it's twist and turns will keep almost every audience entertained and intrigued. Even the ending is awesome and very original, it's those WTF kind of endings but in a good way. This movie isn't really a period piece although it takes place in Victorian era, it's more about the plot than the the time period and this was intentional as well and the plot is intricate and fascinating. It's basically about Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who are magicians and basically rock stars of that time, going against each other and trying to beat each other at there own game, which leads to something much more. This movie is very entertaining and original, to the point right after I finished watching it I had to see it again.

28 November 2008,Are you watching closely?,"Christopher Nolan takes on a Sci-Fi film with a touch of magic as he directs ""The Prestige"". An impressive cast star in it with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the leads; and Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie supporting as the film plays with the viewer's mind more than any movie has since Nolan's ""Memento"". The use of normal linear plot setting along with flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks are what help to accomplish such a perplexing work of genius.

Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are rival magicians in an end-of-the-nineteenth-century London. Borden develops a new trick which frustrates Angier and compels him to do things which are almost inconceivable to find out his secret. Cutter (Caine), Angier's illusion creator, insists that Borden uses a double where Borden goes in through one door and the double comes out the other; much to Angier's disbelief, he vows to find out Borden's method and use it to improve his own act.

""The Prestige"" is yet another astonishing and remarkable film from the fantastically skillful Christopher Nolan which propels the viewer on a ride through the dark hearts of two men. A solid film from a solid director with a solid cast is reason enough to check this masterpiece out. Upon, multiple viewings the film unravels more and more to reveal its true genius inside and out, highly recommended.",10
3 December 2020,"""Were you watching closely?""","The Prestige is both extremely straightforward and endlessly perplexing. When you reach the final twist you may think the experience is over, but the greater implications of his character's actions are exactly what make this one of Nolan's best films. Releasing a year after Batman Begins, Nolan pushes aside the blockbuster superhero shtick for a self-reflective film about obsession and love for one's craft. The themes explored are limited and specific, and Nolan focuses on them with pin-point accuracy throughout the entire runtime. It is a confusing and devastating film which is ultimately about art, admiration, and how far someone is willing to go to achieve their goals.

The only issue I found was with Scarlet Johansson's character, Olivia, who seemed to have a ton of potential but ended up lacking dimension-I'm not a fan with how sidelined the three women in this movie are in general, but Johansson's character is by far the flattest.

Nolan jumps around through time quite a lot throughout the movie, but these choices actually serve the plot rather being a gimmick. Great performances from Christian Bale, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, and Piper Perabo (who should have been one of our biggest movie stars!). And, oh yeah, one of Hugh Jackman's best performances to date.

The Prestige deserves a second viewing (at least!) as soon as possible. Nolan ends the movie by gentling goading us, the audience, to see if we have fully received the magic of the film: ""Were you watching closely?"" Well, were you?",9
13 August 2011,The Prestige Review,"The Prestige is a brilliant story of revenge, jealousy, and obsession between two 19th century magicians. This movie really works because of the good performances, great direction from Christopher Nolan, and a story that keeps you guessing. Alfred Boden (Christian Bale), and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), start off as two magicians aides that are quite good friends. But after a series of unforgivable events, the two becomes enemies constantly trying to one-up each others work. This is when the story becomes a gripping revenge and obsession thriller, with each magician vying to create the perfect illusion. Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career as the emotionally tormented and obsessed Angier, a man who loses everything in order to create the ultimate trick that not even Boden can top. Bale gives a good enough performance, but he does come off as a smug jerk of a character throughout the majority of the film. The good acting as well as the intense direction really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you just as perplexed and frustrated as the magicians in terms of finding out how these illusions are performed. One thing I was worried about with this movie was that after going through many twists and turns, it wouldn't all tie together in a conceivable way. Once the movie reached its climax, however, the whole thing made complete sense and came together in a very nicely. Overall, this is a great obsession story that really makes you think, and also features good acting and near perfect direction. A definite must-see, especially for Christopher Nolan fans.",9
28 July 2021,Are you watching closely ?,"C. Nolan is one of those movies that proves why he is such a great director. It is an excellent film with its excellent cast, screenplay, editing, shootings, plot twist and everything else.

14 October 2013,The Secret Impresses No One. The Trick You Use It For Is Everything.,"An ingeniously crafted tale of twists & turns, a fascinating vignette of obsession & jealousy, and an interesting illustration of friendship & rivalry, The Prestige is a magical piece of thrilling cinema by Christopher Nolan which comes with its own set of pledge, turn & prestige moments just like any great magic trick and cleverly manages to take its ordinary premise & turn it into something truly extraordinary.

The Prestige is the story of a friendship that became a rivalry which later turned deadly. The plot concerns two renowned stage magicians in London near the end of the 19th century who engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate illusion but their increasing obsession to best each other's tricks eventually leads them on a path which culminates with devastating consequences.

Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film presents the master director in sublime form & is quite possibly the most creative work of his film career. He might have upgraded to making only big- budget blockbusters ever since but this is where Nolan's talents as a filmmaker are at its most bare. Each element is carefully processed & cleverly integrated into the picture and the final pay- off is as satisfying as it is spellbinding.

The screenplay marks the first collaboration between Nolan brothers & is deftly adapted from the novel of the same name. Art direction wonderfully brings late 19th century London & Colorado to life, Cinematography captures every moment in clear, crisp detail while also making extensive use of hand-held shooting & cold colour temperatures, Editing is the film's finest aspect without a doubt while composer David Julyan chips in with a fitting score.

Coming to the performances, The Prestige features a star-studded cast in Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall & Michael Caine, and they're all pretty convincing in their given roles with Jackman & Bale impressing the most as two rival magicians. Even Caine's character plays a significant part here unlike his supporting roles in other Nolan films. And Johansson does a good enough job playing both pawn & player in the featured rivalry.

On looking back, what's even more astonishing is that everything we want to know is right in front of us. From its opening moments, the film keeps dropping obvious hints about its mystery yet successfully manages to create an illusion of hiding a big secret. And just like those people amongst the audience waiting to be amazed by an upcoming magic trick, we fail to see it because we're not really looking. Because just like them, we want to be fooled.

On an overall scale, The Prestige is one of the finest achievements in the directional career of Christopher Nolan that intertwines its three acts of storytelling with three acts of illusion in a highly rewarding manner to deliver a cinematic experience that's magical in every sense of the word. An immensely compelling take on obsession, rivalry, secrecy, sacrifice & duality, The Prestige is that great magic trick which viewers won't soon, if ever, be able to recover from. One hundred percent recommended.",
27 November 2006,"Better Than Most Current Movies in Theaters, but Ultimately Disappointing (no spoilers)","The Prestige has a lot of good things going for it. Great acting, a top-notch cast, interesting characters, beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes. The film takes place in the late-Victorian period just as science is about to advance by leaps and bounds. Understanding, harnessing and manipulating electricity is the new and exciting craze. Add in two rivaling magicians who want to top each other's best act and the stage is set for what I hoped would be a gripping story. Piper Perabo was the most likable character and wish she had more screen time. There's also a sci/fi twist that is quite interesting too. All kinds of good things to make a great film.

But...

There are several ways that The Prestige didn't work for me. It has huge plot holes and continuity problems. Upon further analysis after the film, the logic was just plain sloppy. These issues should have been addressed and rewritten prior to filming. It really ruined the magic of the film.

The pacing is uneven. Most of the time it's very slow (slower than Masterpiece Theater). If I had been watching the film on TV, I wouldn't have made it all the way through, but I was in the theater so it kept my attention span.

The ending though interesting, was very disappointing. The film turned into a second-rate, M. Shymalan script for the last half hour. People in the theater were laughing after the end monologue because it sounded heavy-handed and ridiculous.

Even though the actors did a good job, the range of each character was quite small. There was no depth. Jackman was obsessive, Caine was the all-knowing sage, Bowie was the mysterious scientist, Johansson was the slut, and all the rest. You get the idea. The lack of growth in the character development made the story boring and stale. I just didn't find myself caring for what happened to any of them by the end.

The Prestige is actually a rather dark film. Much sadder and than I expected. It is not a feel good film. I would have been fine with the darkness if the plot didn't have so many holes in it. I usually enjoy a good mystery or thriller, but found the twists to be rather predictable.

A quick warning for animal lovers: there's some animal cruelty. It's not as horrible as The Brothers Grimm, but it's something to be aware of if you are going to take a child to see the film or are sensitive about those things.

If you aren't into analyzing films and don't care about it making sense, you'll probably enjoy the film. I was fine with the sci/fi aspect of The Prestige, it's the plot that has the problems. Some of the twists work and some are just silly and sloppy writing.

I sincerely wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't as dazzling as I had hoped it would be. I wanted it to be a 10, but the most I can give it is 7.",4
6 May 2017,Are You Watching Closely?

14 May 2015,Competent but not stellar. Or interstellar.,"Professional rivalries between magicians in Victorian London: fun subject matter? Well, its quite melancholy in Christopher Nolan's hands. Its let down a bit by the casting of Hugh Jackman; he's just somehow miscast as a Victorian magician.

Its a hard film to love. Everyone is just a little too spiky and distant, there's not a single character you engage with. It feels more like a technical exercise than an engaging story. Its just a little too conventional in its Love-Triangle style construction. I like it better than Now You See Me for example, but less than other Nolan pictures like Inception and Interstellar. I didn't love The Prestige in 2006 and I still don't love it in 2015; funny how some things don't change.

10 June 2016,Proves magic can be boring,"For all the magic, all the tricks, and all the twists and turns this convoluted plot takes, it ultimately fails at creating cinematic magic: providing the audience with an emotionally satisfying experience.

Did this film need to be so long? Did it need to be so complicated? It opens and closes with an explanation about how magic tricks are performed in order to truly amaze the audience. Ironically the screenwriter did not familiarize himself with the basic rules of writing movie scripts. The script suffers from several defects:

1. It drags on too long and falters eventually. By the end the audience is too bored to even care about what is supposed to be a fantastic climax. Unfortunately, it ends up being an anti-climax.

2. We do not really care about characters. We can't relate to so many of them anyway. Nobody can. Especially if they are not interesting. The bottom line is that no one in this film is interesting, except perhaps David Bowie as the genius Tesla. Unfortunately he doesn't really do much and the whole subplot with him, like so much else in this film, is unnecessary.

3. There is no message in this film. The whole rivalry story is unpersuasive, both in terms of motivation for the characters, and in terms of internal logic. The final speech given by the protagonist that is supposed to reveal his deep yearnings and the demonic force that has made him create the whole orgy of senseless violence, comes down to... Well, watch and see. You will be disappointed.

4. As I said, there is a persistent lack of logic. Why do these guys do what they do? Why do they invest all their lives in rivalry and hiding secrets from one another, yet can't seem to predict that the other one might try and sabotage their act? It is very hard to follow this film when one cannot empathize with the characters, understand their deep motivations, or figure out why they keep doing stupid things over and over again. Even the climax of the film includes some unbelievably stupid decisions made by the protagonist. Can this master of deceit not predict that the other guy might come after him? Maybe the screenwriter should have spent less time inventing complicated tricks and focused more on some basic logic.

In sum, I feel empty after watching this film, and would not recommend it to anyone. It sets up a potentially interesting story, it takes us through more than two hours of plot, and it somehow fails to deliver a worthy climax - or, should I say, 'prestige'? One out of ten stars.",1
7 April 2020,Excellent production with a broken plot contract,"The Prestige is a superb period mood piece with outstanding cinematography, excellent acting, great dialogue - and a plot that is a huge let down.

We are told that every magic trick consists of three parts: the Pledge, that sets the stage and seemingly makes any trickery impossible, the Turn, where the trick happens, and the Prestige, where it all comes together to amaze and baffle the audience. The Prestige delivers a zinger of a Pledge: a vividly imagined Victorian London, a mysterious death, and two young genius friends turned bitter rivals - and an impossible piece of stage magic on which it all hinges. It all plays out splendidly with fantastic performances by both lead and supporting actors (with the exception of David Bowie's poorly conceived Nikola Tesla, and Scarlett Johansson, while great, is wasted on a role that never goes anywhere).

But The Prestige lacks the Prestige. After setting the expectations high for a fiendishly clever reveal, the entire soufflé collapses as the finish relies on not one but two cop-outs that break the contract between storyteller and audience.

All in all, The Prestige is immensely enjoyable for its acting, dialogue and cinematography for close to two hours, despite some plot weaknesses and occasional slow pacing, and equally immensely frustrating as the expectations for a clever reveal are not so much subverted as simply betrayed.

Had as much effort been put into the plot as into the production, The Prestige might have been a masterpiece. As it is, it is still a very good film as long as you don't invest too much in the plot reveal.",6
4 March 2011,"""Are you watching closely?""","Set In the 19th century, this film tells the tale of three friends. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to a magician. When a water tank trick goes horribly wrong, Robert and Alfred become bitter rivals in the magic industry, trying anything to ruin each others illusions.

With one of the best cast line ups in recent years, there's not much chance of losing interest in the stories' characters. I can't single out any one performance because they really do each have their own evocativeness. The film is so consistent with beautiful sets & imagery it really is a feast for the eyes.

It's hard to find something wrong with this film. Christopher Nolan is one of the best Directors of today, and this film is more than proof of it. It seems to have been handled with such care. There's chemistry between all the elements and no scene is less than spectacular.

Direction: 10/10 (Christopher Nolan knows how to keep an audience from looking away) Cinematography: 10/10 (Visually stunning, such depth in those rich undertones from Wally Pfister) Editing: 10/10 (Lee Smith's sequences are well executed and fitting for drama) Acting: 9/10 (Some minor things may bother you, but not enough to keep you from enjoying) Dialogue: 10/10 (Some very well thought concepts are conveyed through the dialogue alone) Sound: 10/10 (The huge sound team put together a phenomenal recording of pristine quality) Effects: 9/10 (Well coordinated effects which are seamlessly integrated into the film) Art Direction: 10/10 (Realistic sets and props really nurture the film's aesthetic) Costumes: 10/10 (Very fitting, excuse the pun, for the period) Music and/or Score: 10/10 (Lovely orchestrations which give life to moments with no dialogue)

Total Score: 98/100

The Prestige is an enchanting film with some subtle charms. David Bowie's small role as Nicola Tesla is also something to make note of. If you can allow yourself to be drawn into the world of magic then this is a film you will live.",9
25 April 2010,Battle of the Magicians,"Nolan's 'The Prestige' is full of magic and surprises. Based on Christopher Priest's absorbing novel, Nolan brings it to life on screen. The story develops from interesting premise about two magicians, who were once friends, now turned into rivals. But the strength of the storytelling lies in how the events unfold with its twists and turns, keeping the viewer in sheer suspense and wonder while at the same time never losing its main focus. The director has an eye for visuals and almost each and every frame of the movie is very intricately detailed. The film is set during some time in the Victorian era but I liked that it still felt contemporary rather than a period piece. Yet, that is not to say that the art direction does not deserve mention. Quite the contrary because toning it down had a brilliantly subtle effect. Likewise, the cinematography too is effectively downplayed. The score flows smoothly. Hugh Jackman delivers one of his best works to date. The actor is simply excellent as the caring and easy-going turned into ambitious, competitive and vengeful magician. Christian Bale too is impressive while Michael Caine almost always knows how to deliver a memorable performance and here he's no different. Scarlett Johanssen is quite forgettable while Rebecca Hall fairs better and Piper Perabo shines in a small role. 'The Prestige' is one of Nolan's best (along with his debut 'Memento') movies. Not only because it's spectacular to look at but it has all that I look for in a movie experience.",
14 March 2017,Magnificent. Brilliant.,"I don't know why I don't give this 10. It's perhaps a principal. This movie deserves all the praise in the world.

This movie combines so many satisfying elements. It's an extremely well written movie that will turn and twist the plot several times, and make sure you are left with a million questions.

But at the end, all those questions are answered. Ahh, and the satisfaction.

An emotionally strong, deceptively clever, star class performed, visually stunning, and magic induced movie that perhaps shows us the very best of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, in a vicious battle of rivals as two magicians will do anything in their power to outperform the other.

Also, ""sophisticated"", I believe, deserves to be mentioned as a key keyword for this movie. Beautiful.

I don't care who you are, or whether you like ""these kind of movies"" or not, it's still something you must see. The world of movies would not be the same without The Prestige.",9
12 September 2010,A Thrilling Magician's Tale!,"Christopher Nolan has turned out to be one of the best directors of this century so far. He made fantastic movies such as the two latest Batmans, Memento, and Inception. This is another movie to add to that list. It's not as good as those mentioned but this is a worthy addition especially with the excellent acting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.

This takes place in London at the turn of the 20th Century. It tells the story of two rival magicians who will do nothing except get the best out of each other.

The acting is solid. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were the ones who carried this movie. Of course, Scarlett Johansson looks as good as ever. Michael Caine also deserves some credit.

Overall, this is a nice, dark-toned movie. I loved the setting background and the costumes. One side note, I could not recognize David Bowie. This is a great movie. I rate this movie 8/10.",8
22 December 2021,I really don't have a single criticism with The Prestige,"The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan, and is a story centred around a rivalry between two magicians who so desperately need to create the ultimate illusion. However this obsession brings about dark and tragic consequences, causing both magicians to lose site of their humanity. This film is so under appreciated in my opinion, and that's merely due to the fact that I don't think people realise that a plot like this does not come around very often. Seriously, a realistic, dark and mysterious movie about magicians... am I the only person who thinks that's really cool? And the best part is, the movie actually delivers. Nolan doesn't just tell a story about magicians, he takes it one step further and structures the entire movie as if it were a magic trick. Hiding something in plain site, which by the twist has us questioning everything we just watched. Out of all of Nolan's films The Prestige has always seemed to intrigue me little more. The atmosphere created in 19th century London, is everything from sophisticated to eerie. The performances form Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are absolutely captivating. They both completely embody their character's and present such an intense rivalry, which had me forgetting it was fictional. The cinematography is also insanely beautiful, yet subtle. The camera work and lighting, really emphasises and dark and gritty nature of the movie, which immerses its audiences into the film even further. I really don't have a single criticism with The Prestige. On first viewing, the film did leave me feeling quite perplexed with how the ending added up to the rest of the film. That is why I highly recommend to see it again. On second viewing it is an entirely different film. Nolan's subtlety is genius. There is so much thought and detail sprinkled all over this film. I've seen it countless times now, and I still manage to find something new to appreciate. The Prestige is one of my all time favourite films.",10
24 August 2020,Amazing,"This was an incredible film and one of the best I've seen. There are so many twists and turns that all serve a greater purpose. The expert level of direction and misdirection truly make this an incredible experience to watch. The characters of the film are also very compelling as they have their own dark emotional journeys. Just like a magic trick, the audience is tricked until the stunning end.

27 June 2007,Tesla - Have you watched him closely?,"The film is brilliant, but its brilliance is also it's greatest downfall. It's a film for the awakened, but a sleeping pill for the already sleepy. To appreciate the film is to already be aware of certain facts, or to have faith in certain schools of thought, primarily the possibility of time travel.

Tesla was a genius. A scientific prophet maybe. He claimed that concepts for many of his inventions simply appeared to him in his mind's eye or in a dream. A long explanation of Tesla's life could be made by somebody with sufficient knowledge, which I don't have. But I do have faith - that he was a man who knew things that have changed and will continue to change the world and the way that we think.

The film is a truth puzzle. To understand the film, is to understand that there are concepts and ideas that have been repressed from us, to be free from the fear of uncertainty, and to embrace the vast pool of possibility and discovery that is humanity's gift. The film addresses the two polar characteristics of man - his ability to be logical, and his ability to be emotional - and merges them into a mutually exclusive relationship. That is, one cannot exist without the other.

For those who are at odds with the film - the prestige of our lives is the discovery of truth, and I encourage those who wish to understand it's message. Hell, it's worth it. I love this film, and the passion put into it by the actors and other artists. It defines the age we live in, and is an elaborate and magnificent portrait of our collective soul in this modern age.",10

18 November 2006,Obsession and the prestige,"The Magic

I have found that many of my friends seem incapable of enjoying magic tricks. They have an overwhelming desire to guess how the trick is performed  if they succeed, the trick is essentially ruined as no element of mystery remains. If they should however fail, they feel frustrated and cheated. It seems that the only way to truly enjoy magicians is if you let them fool you. In the last fifteen years a genre of films closely following the pattern of the best magic tricks has begun to emerge  films that incorporate a shocking ""twist"" ending which often change the nature of everything that had gone on before. Arguably the best (and one of the first) was the excellent ""Usual Suspects"". The film's twist was largely unexpected (not just the nature of the surprise ending but also the fact that it even exists) and as consequence was an immense popular and critical success. After that, many films have taken up the strategy, with varying degrees of success. The trap that many of them fall into is that the twist ending overshadows everything else in the film. If the audiences know that a twist ending is coming they might overlook the film itself in trying to guess the ending. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" suffered from the disease. Despite being possibly the most intelligent dissection of superheroes ever committed to film, a disproportional amount of attention and criticism were directed against the relatively weak surprise in the end, largely due to unreasonable expectation of following up or even outdoing ""The Sixth Sense"".

At least in one part of the reviews and responses, a similar response is shaping up for ""The Prestige"". This is deeply unjust. The film's point above all else is the characterisation of two obsessive characters: Angier and Borden, and that is accomplished brilliantly. And the ending might not that be that bad either.

The Rivals

As others have stated the film revolves around the conflict of two magicians of the XIX century, which starts after the death of Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife for which Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is partially responsible. From then on, the two engage in an escalating and destructive game, which largely revolves around the ""Transported Man""- a trick they both perform. This cat and mouse game leads to some extraordinarily tense scenes that Christopher Nolan directs to perfection. Because the film relies heavily on trickery and misdirection, we are never clear where the events will take us. Furthermore, since there are no clearly defined heroes and villains, the expectations of each character's fate are further confounded.

The cast is phenomenal. First and foremost, Christian Bale gives an acting masterclass. His Alfred Borden is a deeply obsessed, cold and conflicted personality etched with remarkable clarity by Bale, especially considering the relatively constricting screenplay. His character is not inherently sympathetic but Bale is able to infuse it with enough charisma that he threatens to completely take over the viewers' sympathies. His scenes with Rebecca Hall (who plays Borden's wife) are especially effective  Bale is equally believable as a loving husband and a man too obsessed with his magic to care for his wife.

Hugh Jackman does almost equally as well (although he can't quite match Bale's powerhouse performance). He has a more interesting role and a better-developed character arc. Angier starts off as a relatively positive figure, a light-hearted showman and a more obvious protagonist than the brooding Borden. The main plot of the film shows his growing obsession with Borden and his more increasing disregard for anything or anyone else. By the time the film pulls into the final third, his character has undergone a deep transformation into a much more sinister and unpleasant figure  an almost out and out villain. Jackman more or less pulls it off and only seems out of his depth in a few scenes opposite Michael Caine where he, and anyone else, are reduced to scenery as Caine gives a deeply human and above all effortless performance.

The most curious of all however, is David Bowie. How he chooses to portray Nikola Tesla is inspired, fiercely original and unexpected. His Tesla functions perfectly in the context of the plot  Bowie giving him just the right tone so that the Tesla of the film can be reconciled with the Tesla of reality. In addition, Bowie's performance is sufficiently layered to leave an open door for a more satisfying interpretation of the ""surprise"" ending.

The Twist

The film, by the time it ends, gives an explanation of how both versions of ""The Transported man"" are performed. Borden's version is the film's central mystery and some viewers may feel cheated because the solution is relatively easy to guess (personally I was completely fooled up until the very end  and as consequence was tremendously entertained).

Angier's version is also clearly explained  and represents the films biggest weakness. The explanation offered is a major disappointment and it mars the tone of the film significantly. However, at second glance, there is another interpretation that the film seems curiously unwilling to completely deny. Apart from a single shot, which gives credence to the ""official"" explanation, the film chooses to be ambiguous. Every other scene that takes us behind the scenes of Angier's trick is either deliberately unclear or depicted in flashback. Considering how obsessive the Nolan brothers are about tying up loose ends, it is difficult to believe that the ""alternative"" explanation is accidental. As the film itself puts it: ""Once you explain the trick, you are nothing."" Is it possible they deliberately left it unexplained? After all, that's what a prestige is for.",10
10 May 2021,Definitely A Thinker!,"It has taken me a couple of days to mull over this film in order to write its review.

In general I do believe that it's a good film and a good story, but it perhaps has too many twists, so that you don't know what to believe in the end? It all moves a bit too fast as well, I would have liked a few more pauses and maybe a slightly longer set up at the start.

The actors all do their parts very well. Love him or hate him, Christian Bale is ideal for these roles. But the biggest surprise for me was David Bowie, who was brilliant.

I can't really say too much more without giving spoilers, which I always try to avoid.

It's definitely an interesting film and worth the watch. See what you think of it.

4 November 2006,Even spoilers will be of no help!,"The movie, if to be described in a single word, is unbelievable, with the word taken in it's utmost literal sense. Christopher Nolan does his magic on the novel written by Christopher Priest in 1995, and brings it to life in a way no one could have accomplished. With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything.

30 October 2011,"Near-enough to magical; Nolan's twisting, agonising tale of love and aloofness makes for good viewing.","The Prestiege is about performers performing at the top of their game without necessarily being at the peak of their well-being. It's about an emotional drive; a lust to conquer the seemingly impossible, a lust to pound one's opponent into the ground by showing up their entertainments and furthering the superiority that yours has. There are points in the film in which sheer anger and pure, unadulterated drive born out of one's deep feelings see certain characters get to where they are in the entertainments business depicted within; successes born out the hatred for a competitor, and the need to trump him, rather than because their respective show naturally progresses to the performances they end up doing.

Director Christopher Nolan's film explores the quite maddening extent to which men within a particular field go, not necessarily for financial gain but to see their competitors, with whom they share a painful back-story, go nuts in trying to work out the extent of the practise. His film is ultimately a peek into the depraved nature of such a pastime, an exploring of a lust for quest for supremacy in so much one person is able to do what no one else in the world is capable. Such a back and forth is played out in The Prestiege, it here having an air of freshness to it in so much it is played out not as a contemporary crime thriller or similarly toned piece making use of the familiar hypothesis, but as a period drama, in late nineteenth century London, and somewhat remarkably revolves around people engaged in the career field of magic.

We begin in the present on a strand seeing Christian Bale's Alfred Borden in prison, a man seemingly guilty of a drowning which he is accused of perpetrating; during these early scenes, we get a small measure of how much the secrecy of these people's magic means to them when Borden holds back on certain nuggets of information - despite both his freedom and his daughter's well-being there at stake. Miles away, Borden's ex-partner, Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier, is desperate for a meeting with an elusive elderly gentlemen based in some isolated snowy American nether-regions; his presence rearing the attention of somebody operating there, whom he has before neither met nor seen, but who directs praise at Angier for his work within the field of magic and stage trickery. Running on what Nolan achieved in Memento, in terms of tearing up the time-lines and flitting from one moment in time to another, we dart back to the very beginning of where it all began to go wrong for Angier and Borden.

In the past, the pair of them operated in a troupé led by the suave expert in his field, John Cutter (Caine); Angier's wife Julia (Perabo) and a master of ceremonies character in true-to-life magician Ricky Jay. Backstage, and prior to going out so as to perform what they've been performing for a good stretch of time beforehand, the characters appear to clash in regards to what direction the group ought to head from here on in; Borden desiring the moving onwards and upwards to better things but whose enthusiasm is unmatched. During one particular show, tragedy strikes when disaster befalls a specific trick involving Julia and a seemingly-impossible escape from a glass container full with water; Julia not getting out in time and drowning before Angier's very eyes, thus the murder of which Bale was accused during the opening thus rears its head. What unfolds is an extension of the diligent lengths Nolan went during 2002's Insomnia, a film about a police officer seen killing another police officer by the very man he is there to catch; a film spilling out into a power struggle between two men of whom moral lines are blurred and one appears as distasteful as the other in spite of the fact they are near-enough poles apart. This is another one of those films in which heterosexual romances unfold around the fact that the film is ultimately about men and men co-existing with one another, and that nothing can deter them from what life's true purpose seemingly offers up: the need to quench a drive for implementing defeat upon them.

Nolan deals with each strand attentively and in a thorough manner; the film's story, cascading into a bitter rivalry built on resentment never quite made clear as to whether it's out of anger of a false-accusation; unadulterated revenge or just pure hatred and jealousy for another man, is difficult not to get caught up in. Amongst this, the multi-equilibrium approach expressed through Angier's apparent attempts to bury ghosts in his venturing to America acts as a fascinating post-scripture to predominant duelling. It is something that furthermore carries with it enough enticing drama, as this lead becomes more and more involved with apparent recluse madmen, to follow the film on through to a denouement dealing with questions posed throughout the project's main body. A quaint parallel lies with the fact Nolan knows he is making a film about people putting on a show; people wanting to do their best for a paying audience out to see those whom they recognise going through motions inherently and professionally. His film, itself full of tricks and twists causing us to take a step back and think about it, is just as good-a slice of showmanship as anything his characters can conjure up.",7
10 July 2012,Magic Done Right,"The Prestige is a complicated thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. A magician, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), is in jail for murdering a rival, Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman). Both were working with Milton and his sidekick, John Cutter(Michael Caine). During a magic act with Angier's wife, Julia, she drowned, and Borden was blamed for using the wrong knot when tying her up.

The two become enemies, sabotaging each others acts. Angier ruins Borden's bullet catch, which costs him two fingers, and Borden pays Angier back by wrecking his bird act, which injures a member of the audience.

Borden comes up with the transported man, where he enters one cabinet and comes out another. Angier copies it by hiding under the stage. He finds Nikola Tesla(David Bowie)and has him build a real transportation machine. Thomas Edison sends some people to burn the lab, and Tesla warns Angier to destroy the device. Of course, the inventor is ignored, and this leads us to a big surprise ending, which worked for me. Nolan uses beautiful sets with intricate tricks and excellent acting, all around. The Prestige is a top notch mystery.",8
21 October 2006,"dark, but very cool","i'll keep this short

i loved it, i knew i it would be great simply from the cast and the director. i wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark but i loved every minute of it and was happy it was done this way. Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.

Great Movie, a must see

26 August 2015,Industrial light & magic (rental),"Well, i was reluctant to rent this movie as the story didn't appeal very much to my tastes : however, now, after watching it, i found it good, not exceptional or prestigious but better than the actual trend : Nolan is indeed a great director as he knew how to grasp my attention since the first minutes : The art direction is rather excellent with big theaters, stages and all the feel of the « Victorian » era. All the cast is at the same level : Wolvie, Batman, black widow Even the second parts are well filled : Perabo, Gollum, David Bowie, Michael Caine and for sure Rebecca Hall! The story is not as linear and simple as i feared : it's full of twists and flashbacks so we better pay attention and this competition between those two is rather violent, absolute and in a way, sad and tragic...

17 November 2019,"Gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.","The Prestige gets right to the heart of why we even watch movies in the first place, and does so in a way that is both intellectually stimulating, deeply moving, and completely paradoxical. Nolan demonstrates a rare and truly deep understanding of the human condition in a most rewarding and honest way. This sublime accomplishment is sadly overlooked.

20 July 2007,Surprising and thought-provoking,"It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.

I have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice.

21 October 2008,My Favorite Film Of All Time.,"The Prestige, is a film about love, friendship, rivalry, competition, and magic. The film is Christian Bale (Borden) and Hugh Jackman (Angier) who are friends and become enemies as they compete with each other for a number of reasons.

Christopher Nolan, the director is perfect for this film, he creates an atmosphere perfect for every scene, will his leads act throughout this atmosphere like it's their own creation. Wally Pfister, director of cinematography should have won an Oscar for this, exaggeration? Watch the film yourself.

I can guarantee that you will love this film. Sit down with a plate of nachos, and watch. A brilliant film, which will consume you, and make you want to watch it over and over again.

28 March 2007,holds you but isn't always easy to follow,"Intricate, serpentine thriller-not a surprise from co-writer/director Christopher Nolan-set toward the turn of 20th century London about two ambitious magicians: a charismatic seeker of fame with a penchant for showmanship...and a sly and dazzling illusionist, who are devoted partners until their greatest trick goes tragically awry. Torn apart by mutual resentment and one-upmanship, a bitter rivalry escalates into a lengthy obsession of deceit and sabotage. Slow at first but the story is interesting, the two leads formidable (Jackman lively and flamboyant, Bale mysterious and subdued), and there's a lot of chicanery and hocus pocus to please the eye, but the plot is confusing, even indecipherable at times, and the ending feels contrived. It still builds suspense and intrigue, but would require multiple viewings to appreciate all the skill and craft. **½

27 November 2020,"Another Smart, Unpredictable Thriller from the Nolan Brothers","An onstage tragedy begets a lifelong blood feud between two illusionists in Edwardian London. As the pair of tortured former apprentices take turns one-upping and/or sabotaging each other, stakes spiral out of control and doses of collateral damage are traded like chips at the poker table. There's always a new trick to master, metaphorical mountains to summit in the name of ultimate victory, and this duel of private obsession leaves no stone un-crushed. As they confound and confuse one another, so do they astonish and amaze the viewer; half the fun is in learning how each man achieves the impossible, then watching as their rival maliciously thwarts it before a paying audience.

Magnetic costars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman really wore their working boots to this set, allowing their heavyweight personalities to smash and spark from the very first word. Their performances are boosted by a string of excellent supporting players. Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson make wonderful contributions, as always, but there's something extra-special about David Bowie, in a typically small, offbeat role, as the reclusive Russian genius Nikola Tesla.

With the Nolan brothers working behind the camera, twists and turns are to be expected, and after setting the stage with a series of low-key appetizers in the early acts, they deliver a string of jumbo-sized whoppers during the climax. Expertly paced and brilliantly tailored to match the tempo and bravado of a world-class magic act, The Prestige is a high-water mark in the writer/director duo's already-impressive filmography.",9
1 November 2006,Boring,"Wow. A ""huge"" twist that you can see coming down Main Street about an hour and a half before this slow moving, snore fest ends. And not only is the story not entertaining or surprising in any way - it's also long. Way too long.

There is a good time piece atmosphere set, but who cares. ""Watching Paint Dry part 6 - this time it's water based"" may have been a better title.

It wasn't all bad. There was a hot chick beside me. And the popcorn had a lot of butter.

I am truly surprised that anyone found any entertainment in this film. I'm not sure if the worse part was the slow moving story, or the supposed surprise that in no way should surprise anybody. Somehow, the writers managed to make the story totally unbelievable in every way as well. Now, one may think that getting rid of reality would give the liberty to make an entertaining story - but they managed to avoid this. I guess for film students, and aspiring writers it may be a confidence booster in their own abilities.",1
12 August 2021,humorless,"The writer/director thinks dramatic means sucking the life out of actors, plus adding a cliche atonal spooky ambient soundtrack behind every scene. There is no doubt a way of making a ruthless competition between rival magicians in the 19th Century compelling, but this big expensive bore of a movie hasn't got a clue as to how to do that . . .

Nolan accomplished a unique, not to say magical movie. From the actors and their performances to the dialogs to the background music...everything is presented in a magical way. Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: The movie shows you something ordinary, but of course it isn't. The second act is called The Turn: The movie makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. You have just seen The Prestige! :)

25 June 2012,Dazzles in its Enigmatic Mystique,"Picture this: you're at a magic show and see an impossible but brilliant magic trick. A mix of awe and bewilderment consumes you as you lust after the answer you will not likely get. But here is an unrelenting quest for that answer, a determination to find out how for a cause which is dark, twisted and mystifying. Such is the way 'The Prestige' engrosses you.

A period drama depiction of a unique post-renaissance art, 'The Prestige' shows the lengths to keep, attain and steal secrets, a story about power, pride and mind games with the viewers, the on-camera audience and the characters. We see what was the foundation of modern day magic but the darker, more cutthroat side of it which is both morally and ethically questionable.

The film is based around a piece de resistance and the way in which the illusionary employed translates to treachery. The vicious circle of deceit and obsession for power and respect is mind- boggingly riveting. Christopher Nolan leads you on a path where everybody looks antagonistic and spiteful, he gradually changes your perceptions of people in ways which can be sudden and in others where you watch the morphing process as it unfolds, much like a stage tragedy sans the melodrama.

The title works in such a contrasting manner to the film, the two protagonists aim for prestige but in doing so, seek to destroy one another's. The great shroud of mystique involved in this process is complicated and takes time to grip your mind from believing 'The Prestige' to be just another period drama. It was not a film that captures your imagination from square one even if it may with time. It ambles along in a manner befitting a magician revelling in his trickery but the pace can be frustrating, if only for the sin of curiosity.

Christian Bale presents Alfred Borden as this arrogant, cocky lad but beneath that presumptuousness and pride lies a crafty and wily conniver but comfortably the more intelligent of the two illusionists. Bale shows this so subtly yet with panache through the character's actions which are brief but have wide ramifications. He also brings a sense of irony to the character, one in which he apparently disguises truth from himself making for a strangely compelling personality.

This wild ambition meets Robert Angier's emotion, which drives him to sink to Borden's depths despite being a more astute character. Hugh Jackman's performance is an emotional roller-coaster, the character that Nolan uses to toy with our minds in this wonderfully curious manner, whose descent is portrayed with fervour. The female lead, Scarlett Johansson, is superbly enigmatic. She is the advertisement of the film representing the mystery and unpredictability embodying the story.

The quintessential illusion is described at the beginning and the film plays out like these three acts building to 'the prestige', the big divulgence. Simple but sensational was how it struck me, but each to their own experiences, it depends what questions you desire to be answered. Nonetheless, whether it robs you of your dream reveal or gives it to you, you cannot deny the ingenuity surrounding the mystery ride you've been put on.",8

26 November 2006,Tribute to Nicola Tesla,"This is a great movie and proof that Hollywood CAN still create excellent movies WHEN IT WANTS TO (which is not too often). The acting is excellent and the story is original and quickly engages the audience. Also, this movie is a tribute to one of the great inventors in history, Nicola Tesla. Mr. Tesla was responsible for the introduction of alternating current and knowing that will make the movie even more entertaining. Indeed, perhaps Hollywood should make a movie about the life and career of Nicola Tesla. All the actors in this movie are excellent and offer compelling and powerful performances, especially by Hugh Jackman who proves once again that he is one of the premier actors in Hollywood today. Watch this movie.

29 May 2022,"The Prestige is entertainment of indisputable quality, since, in addition to entertaining and surprising, it creates a rich universe like its protagonists","One of the main problems with films full of twists concerns the importance they have for the appreciation of the story: in many cases, if the audience perceives what is to come ahead of time, the rest of the projection becomes just an exercise in patience; on the other hand, even if the viewer is taken by surprise, it is quite likely that the film will not survive a second examination, becoming boring or - worse - disappointing for bringing many holes in logic. On the other hand, there are those films that become even more fascinating when revisited, since the fact that we know their secrets offers new and surprising readings - in other words: what was mere surprise turns into rich dramatic irony. This is the case of works such as The Sixth Sense, Mulholland Drive, Magnolia, Psycho, Fight Club, American Hustle and, to cite just one more beautiful example, The Prestige.

Written by brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan from Christopher Priest's book, the screenplay is as clever as its main characters - and even if we manage to uncover a plot secret or two before it's officially revealed, the film brings several other twists that are sure to come. Will take us by surprise. This, however, is to be expected, as The Prestige revolves around two individuals who value secrecy above anything else: Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are magicians who, in the late 19th century, develop a rivalry proportional to their professional success. Former disaffected, they are not satisfied with their own successes, striving, too, for the other to become a failure - which starts a series of events that will likely culminate in the destruction of both.

The plot of the film explains very well what could not be the best phrase to put on the movie poster: ""are you paying attention?"". Adopting an ambitiously complex narrative structure, the film begins in the ""present"" (as already mentioned, the late 19th or early 20th century), but delves into a series of flashbacks from the moment Borden begins to read the diary. Of his old enemy, who thus becomes a partial narrator of the story. However, the script goes further and, at a certain point, the Angier of the ""past"" begins a reading of Borden's diary, who thus also becomes a co-narrator, establishing a dynamic of flashbacks within flashbacks that can confuse the viewer. At first, but which soon becomes easily understandable, although rich in consequences - suffice it to say that, thanks to this structure, we cannot always trust everything we witness, since, in reality, we are seeing events from points of view. Conflicting views that may even aim to deceive the reader (Angier or Borden, depending on the moment) and, ""indirectly"", the audience. On the other hand, as the projection progresses and everything starts to fall into place, the feeling of satisfaction we experience becomes greater precisely because we participated in the whole process.

As in Memento, Batman Begins and, to a certain extent, Amnesia, this The Prestige rescues a theme that seems to be dear to filmmaker Christopher Nolan: the obsession with a cause or a profession. In Nolan's works, the protagonist is always a man who, willing to do anything to achieve his goals, does not hesitate to make brutal sacrifices - and there are no greater sacrifices than those made by Angier and Borden throughout this film. (In the same way, this obsession - which here translates into rivalry - is also reflected in the historical figure of Nikola Tesla (Bowie, genius), whose scientific and commercial disputes with Thomas Edison end up becoming an important element of the plot.) two magicians, offering the best show is not enough: what matters is not the effect on the audience, but the dexterity of the secrecy involved in the trick, even if this does not bring practical differences in terms of presentations.

Intelligent and ambitious, Angier and Borden are tremendously rational men who, however, surrender to impulsiveness whenever faced with the opportunity to harm each other - and to this intense desire to destroy the enemy is also added the artistic spirit that have: when the former creates a trick whose impact is greater than that conceived by the rival, the satisfaction that this success could bring is minimized by the fact that, in the end, he is forced to remain under the stage, hidden from the audience's gaze. , while a stunt double takes his place in the spotlight (which gives rise to a beautiful scene in which Angier leans alone to thank the applause of an audience that doesn't see him). Of course, despite lamenting the success of the trick created by Angier, Borden is amused to imagine the other's frustration at not being able to receive the applause in person, in a clear indication that the two are more similar than they would like to admit.

All these nuances of the protagonists of The Prestige are portrayed with the talent and sensitivity of the stars of the plot. Jackman, despite his mesmerizing performance as Marvel's retractable clawed mutant, is capable of much higher flights, and here he has confirmed for the first time a talent that is beyond comic book adventures or romantic comedies. His character is complex and sad, but at the same time irresistible. On the other hand, Bale competently constructs the opposite half of this coin, offering a sadder, bitter and dark universe to the viewer. The two work well together in the scene, but are even better when observed individually. If the confrontations they establish seem to need a spark to achieve the desired combustion, it is when viewed separately that we better perceive the potential involved, as it is in these occasions when the performers themselves develop the best they have.

The entire plot is divided into temporal lines that alternate at all times, showing the perspectives of the two main characters through diaries where they confess anguish and play with the other's imagination. And, at that point, supporting characters Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), stagehand; and Sarah (Rebecca Hall), Borden's wife, also complement the magicians' actions in their personal dramas and in the dispute. However, it is in Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) that we have a brief but exceptional arc in bringing light to the bitterness resulting from the search for recognition that both crave, each with their own nature.

But the care of the screenwriter brothers does not apply only to the construction of characters and narrative structure, but also to the resolution of plots and subplots - and, however complex these are, they receive conclusions rich in meaning at different levels, even reaching involve the purest science fiction. And, like the best magic numbers, one of its main mysteries contains an absurdly simple and logical secret - and the merit of the script lies precisely in its ability to divert the audience's attention long enough for the trick to be done by hand. Of the magician on which we did not focus our eyes.

The plot twist is also a widely used resource that gives the tone of deception by taking us to different logical paths, both because we are not sufficiently attentive to the details, while our attention is purposefully directed to the story. The three acts of magic, described by engineer Cutter in the opening scene, serve as a parallel to the acts that develop the film, and that the Nolan brothers (in yet another script collaboration) deliver with quality, despite the ""heavy hand"" in be too explanatory in its final stretch. This is what prevents the film from being as grandiose as it is suggested to us in the construction of its suspense.

Fascinating from beginning to end, The Prestige is entertainment of indisputable quality, since, in addition to entertaining and surprising, it creates a rich universe like its protagonists - and these, in turn, emerge as interesting figures, but also tragic, since they suffer for having been presented with a magnificent gift at the same time they realize that maybe (and this ""maybe"" is enough) there is someone better than them at what they do. Rivalry, obsession and tragedy set the tone of the production well, themes that are so recurrent in the great works against a very interesting background that is magic.

Based on this definition, there is a universe of approaches referring to concepts and illusions with a different exploratory perspective, since script and direction come to life when camouflaging themselves between telling the secret or guiding us to a truth. Or else, we accept that we are being deceived in exchange for good entertainment.",8
13 November 2006,This movie makes for a real magic act...,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",9
31 May 2021,Nolan at his best!,"Yesterday, I watched The Prestige for the third time. I was, yet again, amazed by how thoroughly hypnotizing and entertaining this film is.

One of the greatest aspects of this film is that it has replay value. The first time, I was just hooked by the film's mystery and the puzzle that the film presents. The second time, I loved to discover the little hints that are dropped throughout the film. This time, I was astonished by how much of the film's mysterious atmosphere remains in the third screening. Plus, there were still hints and nudges that I hadn't discovered yet, so that was a lovely surprise.

I cannot stress enough how well Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman work together on screen. It just works. It reminded me of the chemistry that McAvoy and Fassbender have in First Class. I loved seeing them trying to outwit each other.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. The production design, the editing, the pacing, the dialogue. Everything is carefully orchestrated into one beautiful mystery of a film. It may be personal preference, but all of the above mentioned aspects make The Prestige into one of my favourite Nolan films, and probably one of my favourite films in general.",9
12 January 2007,"Beautifully filmed, gripping film!","This film is beautifully made, the acting is superb and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. There are NO boring bits! It's the kind of film that gets you thinking afterwards.

The story grips you from the very beginning, and it is filmed in a way that leaves you hooked on every scene, every last word. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Kane are superb, as usual. When you have three actors such as these and a magnificent story like this one, the result is pure magic. No wonder it has made the top 250 IMDb list already.

If you're heading towards a movie theater anytime soon (or a DVD store in the future), I recommend- no, I *insist* that you watch this film.

I have not hesitated at all to give this film a confident 10/10!",10
26 January 2007,Top Notch!,"When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.

The Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.

Two aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ingénieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.

At first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.

This leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.

For those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.

Every little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.

If someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.

I will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clichés, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5.",9
11 March 2007,Nolan does it again...,"I have been a rather large fan of Christopher Nolan's work, (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia...) and The Prestige is no exception. It is extremely well directed and very well written. The acting is mostly amazing! I never though Hugh Jackman could do such a good job acting. And Christian Bale... Great! I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s. THis movie has made a spot in my top 5, and I really think this is one of very few modern-day masterpieces.

16 October 2014,"Dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful","This was better than I was expecting; dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful. It's a fantastic period piece too and you really find yourself taken back to the Victorian era.

The Prestige follows two stage magicians as they try to one-up and ultimately destroy each over the course of their careers. Always searching for that one next great magic trick and eventually revenge after Alfred (Christian Bale) is accidentally responsible for killing someone close to his brother (Hugh Jackman) Of course there are great performances from all involved and the audience is left trying to catch up and figure out the many twists involved. And while I got the how's of one of them ending up in jail I sure didn't figure out the big reveal at the end. Michael Caine plays their mentor, and there's a neat cameo from David Bowie. Worth watching. 12.13

16 July 2014,Modernist blackness doesn't cut it.,"So. This movie has a cumulative rating of 8.5. It is about magicians/illusionists. One of the great things about watching magicians/illusionists is trying to figure out how they do their tricks/illusions. The movie and reviewers say watch carefully, and, watch the movie again, to see what the tricks/illusions are and try to figure out how they are done. There is just one big fat problem with all that. You can't see anything. The director, cinematographer, and lighting guy are of the silly conceit that period movies should be heard but not seen. The lighting guy analogized to Hitchcock, but there is just one problem with that. With Hitchcock, you might not be able to understand exactly what was going on, you might not be able to figure out what was going on, but you could always see what was going on. I don't understand. The budget for this thing was $40 mill. and they decided to keep people from seeing what they spent their money on. It might have been a decent movie, but it is so dark, you can't see anything, so, what was the point in making the movie. There certainly isn't much point in trying to watch it. Let's face it, a dark black screen isn't that exciting and doesn't hold viewer interest. The big Prestige at the end? You can't see what leads up to it so it doesn't shock, surprise, or matter. 8.5? Can't see it. 1.",1
13 August 2016,Watch closely.....,"The Prestige is an amazing movie. This film is sure to blow away any and all audience members. From the superb acting displayed in every single scene to the terrifically well thought out storyline and writing. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are 2 very gifted actors and that is ever present all throughout the prestige, they have impeccable chemistry between themselves and all the other co stars they are performing on screen with. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca hall are great here too, they both gave focused, intense performances. The plot seems rather simple and like there is not much to it by simply reading it on IMDb, but not everything is as it seems ;). This film is full of so many twists and turns that you'll have to really really watch closely.... As any audience at a magic show would. The movie leaves you feeling amazed and rethinking the scenes in the movie, piecing it all together drawing conclusions. Christopher Nolan is a truly truly talented filmmaker, that becomes evident and obvious to any viewer of this movie. 10/10 for the prestige, it's not hard at all to see why it's in the top rated 150 films. Oh and a shout-out to Michael cane, killed it, as always.",10

30 December 2014,No words!! Simply awesome..,"I really have no words to describe it. One of the best movies, I have seen till now. The tough to understand plot, so dynamic storyline, too awesome performances by each of the actors and actresses, the rhythmic turn of events,slow and steady pace and what not. Everything has been executed so perfectly. The storyline is so scattered yet so well knit. All the scenes, starting from beginning to end, unfolding series of events, the take overs through diaries, the flashbacks, even the last scene, it's marvellous. I am not being able to define the awesomeness of this movie, through words. In fact, words aren't enough. For people, who mistakenly by chance, go through my review, just one word: ""Watch this movie, before you die. Else you are gonna die a looser"".

2 June 2007,Very good film - but need to pay attention!!! :-),"I saw this film on DVD with a few friends, one of which saw it in the cinema and thought it was the most amazing film ever!! One tip - don't watch with a friend who has seen it before and thought it was absolutely fantastic - ruins it a bit!! LOL! But, all that aside, it was a brilliant film - not as good as she was making it out to be but an overall good film. It is one that definitely needs the full attention of watchers as you can get confused easily but it's a film that everyone can enjoy really. Even David Bowie fans!! He was pretty good with his accent - reminds me of his song China Girl! It's a proper ""expect the unexpected"" film - don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave it there. If you don't like complicated films then I wouldn't watch it but it is a must-see-before-you-die (sorry for the negative!!). It has action, romance, slight horror as well - a proper thriller!

13 April 2007,"""The Prestige"": How to make a masterpiece","What's ""The Prestige""? It's an incredible film about two man rivalries. A perfect film with magical performances of all the actors: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make a memorable performance and Michael Caine is Spectacular! Scarlet Johanson gives to us her pretty and her talented to act. David Bowie is interesting. Andy Serkis is strange, being another creature that it isn't Gollum or King Kong. With a fantastic direction and screenplay from Christopher Nolan: a person who I want to say thanks for films like ""Memento"" or ""Batman Begins"". The set, the costumes, the cinematography are so good too. The soundtrack takes to us into the film.

The Prestige is a masterpiece to never forget.

The academy ignored this film, but all of we know that's a very very good movie.

1 November 2020,Sophisticated,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",8
21 November 2007,"Awesome, amazing film","this is a superb film, brilliant script, wonderful costumes and sets, and powerful dialog's, to top that an amazing plot, which is an illusion in itself. makes you feel in the end. I had heard negative reviews in about this film, until I watched it and the whole trick is in the movie itself, it makes you ponder, thats a genius script, as in the movie, the theme is elaborated that the audience knows the trick but how you perform it is what matters.

Over the top performance by Christian Bale, and Jackman, both crafty, both, obsessive, both, lonely and both miserable. thats the price of the trick.

I think this movie ranks at a justified spot. the twist in the end makes it look fake, and gives us something to doubt, which is altogether an essence of the craft itself.

A brilliant movie, do watch it, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys, off the hook stories and superb performances.",10
20 May 2007,A special thriller,"The storyline is very tricky and you have to pay some attention here. It is a thriller from another view of dimension. I didn't see many of those films that have to do with illusions. My wife didn't like it because the time is set in the last century but I don't mind. So we had at the end of the movie mixed emotions and opinions. She gave a 3/10 and me a solid 7/10. I never got bored because the pace was rather fast and there were finally many surprisingly scenes till the end when I was impressed solving the enigmas. All the cast delivered a respectable performance and the director was very good after his disappointing Memento. I think for all these reasons the audience gets a very interesting show. Final vote is a solid 5/10. I am curious how will do the other THE ILLUSIONIST.

30 January 2007,I felt conned...,"I mean you're supposed to feel conned that was the concept of the movie. What I felt conned by was the shoddy script/dialogue and 2D characters - must you become a drunk cliché when your lovers dies looking all mad eyed with the long hair and all??? Must you act 'ave a cuppa tea gvnor!' Scarlett?? I swear I heard you say 'like totally!' But most of all, what really made me mad what really insulted was the end twist! You mean to tell me you spent the whole movie working towards something that was so obvious!! We saw it half an hour during the movie, we guessed it in the relationships! We saw it written in the very in your face dramatic irony! We saw it as obvious as all my exclamation marks! There wasn't even an attempt at diversion. It was poor. The way the movie hid the twist was the the same way as Dick Dastardly plotted his evil doings.

The fact that this movie has already gone into the top 250 shows that our audience can be fooled by anything. Get The Thin Red Line into the top 250 and then maybe, maybe I'll talk with some respect.",2
12 February 2022,Christopher Nolan deserves a standing ovation for this magic show of a movie!,"Alright, I'm going to be honest, I really love Christopher Nolan already as a director and many of his movies but I only learned of this movie's existence a week ago and knew I had to watch it because of the cast and the ratings, plus it's a movie made by him so I knew it would be a fascinating time. I was blown away. Incredible story telling and unexpected plot points that get the audience invested, brilliant performances, and a vibe that can only come from his films. This was an awesome movie and I wish I knew about it earlier!

22 February 2007,"Very good and highly recommended, but not in my top 10 for the year","I've read some of the other reviews after seeing this, and I have the urge to say, ""Get real, this was darn good, but it wasn't THE QUEEN or THE DEPARTED. It's sure better than 75% of the movies out there though.

It's about magic and it draws a person into this world of illusion. Unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, this goes into a world of professional rivalry which escalates until it becomes deadly. As such, it entertains massively and is a movie one will be glad to have seen.

This shows that Christopher Bale and Hugh Jackman certainly are serious actors capable of being more than comic book characters, and Christopher Nolan is more than a director of comic book adaptations.

This is indeed a movie to see, but don't stop here. See THE ILLUSIONIST for a different perspective on the world of illusion and those who live in it.",7
22 October 2006,What a surprise ending!! I was SO CERTAIN that it wouldn't be stupid!,"I don't care about the people in this movie, nor about any romance or struggles they were involved in.

And if I say to hell with the characters--the message is the point; that's even worse. The message is neither inspiring, nor enough of an opposite of inspiring to give the stimulating, titillating gift of darkness.

I really went in wanting to like it, and wanting to care about what was going on (and I really like almost all of these actors). And I'm normally not too good at guessing endings and so on... Wow. Not one single surprise that you weren't at least suspecting far in advance. Sometimes, it just boggled the mind; when something was introduced as a surprise, I was sitting there thinking, ""Um, didn't they explicitly reveal this an hour ago?""

Maybe I'm just missing the point that it's really for twelve-year-old girls or something.

Yes, that must be it.

I really feel robbed. Sometimes after a movie, there's that afterglow that just fills you up. Sometimes, it's so sad and moving that you can think about it five days later and still work up a tear. Sometimes, it's that it's so fun to think about it, over and over the details... In this case, what I'm left with is wanting to kick someone. It's the feeling of sorta wanting to kick myself, but the 8.5-star rating that's currently the average on IMDb excuses my mistake.

The movie makes you feel like a sucker, and gives you almost nothing in return.

It was mildly pretty, but... I'm still waiting for the prestige, here.",4

29 May 2012,Nolan's Exceptional Venture into the World of Magic,"After reinventing the Batman franchise and reminding audiences how awesome they can be when Joel Schumacher isn't involved, director Christopher Nolan took the time to do his own thing. The result was THE PRESTIGE, further proof that Nolan doesn't need a man in a bat costume to prove how awesome a director he is. Nolan is one of the best directors in modern Hollywood for weaving a gripping story with powerful performances from his cast. In THE PRESTIGE, Nolan introduces the audience to the behind-the-scenes world of magic (stage magic, not fantasy magic) with the tale of two rising magicians with an ongoing feud that ultimately consumes both of their lives. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are a couple of magician's assistants/audience plants with aspirations of rising to the top in the world of magic. When a botched escape act ends with the death of Angier's wife, Angier blames Borden and the two part ways as Angier stews with thoughts of vengeance. As Borden goes on to make a name for himself, Angier rages at the thought that Borden be given success after what he'd done and begins a war of escalation as each tries to sabotage the other's acts. The war between the two reaches a new level when Borden debuts a new act called the Transported Man and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secret, eventually turning to infamous scientist Nikola Tesla to harness the power of science in creating his own version.

I love Nolan's movies and this one ranks high as one of his best in my opinion. The story keeps you guessing, the performances are strong, and I absolutely love the setting. The film is set in 19th century England and takes us behind the curtain as magicians devise their latest illusions to baffle audiences. That alone would've made this movie worth my interest, but Nolan's tale of vengeance and obsession brings the movie a whole other level. I love a good magic show and a glimpse into the creation/execution of classic illusions secured my interest, while the incorporation of science elements with the use of Tesla as a plot element turns the whole concept of magic on it's head with his invention. By that point in the film, it had started slipping into the realm of science fiction, which sort of derailed it a bit. It made for an interesting final act, but it was asking for a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I'm no scientist but, come on, you don't need to be to realize that Tesla's invention in the film is an impossibility. Until this point in the film, it was grounded firmly in reality without stooping to ""real magic"" and the sudden inclusion of this miracle machine, while interesting enough, messes with the feel of the movie. Regardless, the film isn't necessarily about the Transported Man or Tesla, it's about the war between Angier and Borden and in that sense the film is a great success.

The story is made powerful by the performances of the two leads: Jackman and Bale. Both men are fantastic actors and create characters that are equal parts sympathetic and detestable. Each one is suffering in their own way: Angier with the death of his wife and Borden with his unwavering commitment to his craft despite how it might affect his personal life. I love that the movie, for a while, leaves the question of who is the film's protagonist hazy. You would believe from the beginning that Angier is the hero, merely seeking retribution for his loss, but later in the film the audience perception shifts and we begin to realize that the Angier's obsession has corrupted him beyond reason and suddenly Borden is the victim. Honestly, each man in the movie engages in acts of violence and cruelty, and neither can really be considered the ""good"" guy. I think that's what makes this movie that much more interesting: there is no real hero. Just a couple of incredibly flawed human beings caught up in something that explodes out of proportion, performed to perfection by Jackson and Bale. The supporting cast is loaded with equal talent: Michael Caine as Angier's engineer, Scarlett Johansson as a magician's assistant caught in the middle, David Bowie (!) as Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis as his assistant. The production design in the movie is incredible and the cast is powerful. If it weren't for the bizarre sci-fi turn in the middle of the movie, this movie would be perfect.",9
10 November 2006,Cinema Homage,"In London at the turn of the XIXth century to the XXth, two young magicians compete to unmask their respective tricks - first moved by revenge, since one attributes to the other the death of his woman, and after by the simple spirit of rivalry, which nothing is capable of pacifying. The trick of the movie: both protagonists have careers as superheroes. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Christian Bale as Batman. What interests most the English director Christopher Nolan (of Amnesia and Batman Begins), however, is the difference of what you see and what you think you have seen - which is, in a certain way, a homage to cinema itself. Besides the great directing, it still has great performances by both Michael Caine and David Bowie.

27 March 2007,Modern Magicians,"I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.

They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that ""The Illusionist"" is a romantic caper film and ""The Prestige"" is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.

What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the ""magic lantern show"", which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves.",6

23 December 2006,clever puzzle,"It's certainly impressive and the way it's filled with turns and twists makes it gain other interesting elements and gets it to continuously challenge the audience. I couldn't say the entire movie is enchanting - that's why in my opinion it doesn't deserve an excellent vote - but when surprises are revealed so that the movie-goer can find the film gripping and, in spite of the complicated plot, ""the trick works"", the result is a story interest to be told. Besiders Cristopher Nolan insists a lot on human emotions as well as on the dimensional aspect, so, although sometimes the film gets a bit too sullen and dry, I can say the aim is reached and the purpose satisfied.

16 October 2007,Pure genius!,"At one point in the film, Hugh Jackman's character says ""That was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" I walked out of the theater thinking the same goddamn thing! This whole movie is just one big trick that the filmmakers have pulled on you, and by the time it's over, you'll realize that you just spent a couple bucks on a huge, two-hour magic trick. This may be my favorite movie ever. Just when you think you know what's going on, something else happens! It is very, very complicated stuff. There are flashbacks upon flashbacks, and it may be a little difficult to follow. Acting a key element in this film, and it's mostly great. Christian Bale carries it all on his shoulders, as he truly is the ""Prestige"" to the film's great rick, which I will not reveal. Hugh Jackman is good as the magician who grows mad with power, but Bale far surpasses him. Michael Caine is as memorable as always, but he's essentially playing a harsher version of the character he played in ""Batman Begins"". One of the best performances comes from Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife, who becomes confused and depressed after he loses his former glory. Scarlett Johannson isn't really offered much to work with but she does have a few memorable moments. The films final twists and turns will leave you so shocked that you realize everything you were going to say you hated about the movie, you now love. See this magic trick. It's very dark and depressing stuff, but you know that you want to be fooled.",10

26 April 2007,An excellent Thriller,"First off, let me tell you some other movies I like in this Genre.

The Usual Suspects, The Inside Man, Phone Booth - Movies where the plot is never standing still; There's always something happening, and you always want to know what's happening.

As The Prestige started, I was thinking that it could be alright, but it was a lot lot more. It was AMAZING.

An extremely good script, and an even better plot.A good performance by Scarlet Johanssen, A great performance by Michael Caine, a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman, and an outstanding one by Christian Bale, tied together with one of the best, most original twists ever, gives you a movie that you'll be thinking about for the rest of the day.

The twist was so good in fact, that about 24 hours after watching it, I was still thinking ""Oh man, that was excellent!!!""",9
8 November 2006,An excellent movie,"The Prestige was a wonderful movie. It had great actors, a great storyline (though sometimes kinda confusing), and was a great thriller. Although I knew the actors playing the characters, I was so into the movie I did not see Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale. I just saw their characters, and that means that they did a good job. I was always hooked on the storyline and was never bored throughout the whole story. I just wanted to see what would happen to the characters. My only problem was that it was kinda confusing. The good guy was the bad guy and vice versa, and the whole concept of cloning was tough to understand, but they ended it very well and in a way that I understood the whole thing. That whole day all I was thinking about was that movie.

30 June 2008,"Great, epic film","This movie is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions. Director Nolan gives us one of his best directing jobs.

This movie contains everything from romance to pity, and power to poverty.

Both Jackman and Bale play amazing characters. Bale is power hungry individual who stops at nothing short of owning and controlling everything in the world.

This movie portrays the feelings and emotions of guilt and punishment.

What is a great story and gripping account of what happens when dreams turn into nightmares.

This is so much better than 'The Illusionist'

I also love the lack of profanity.",9
19 August 2022,There is a very scary line in this movie...,"""Pardon me, it's very rare to see...real magic"" This was the most disturbing line of dialogue in the entire movie.

As pointed out, a trick ceases to be amazing when you know how it works. When this movie ends....you know how it works.

But this one line of dialogue. This is another mystery unto itself.

Of course it could be good anyway if it was just a little logical or reasonable, but it's not the case at all here, weak messy plot, the end is totally disappointing because it makes absolutly no sense, even for kids, come on guys.. I'm trying to be polite here..

25 November 2006,"Less adventurous than Memento, but plenty of fun","""Step right up folks, for the next entertaining and annoying confection from the clever Nolan brothers, who make a perfectly credible plot disappear before your very eyes and send you out of the theatre with a warm glow but also with a vague feeling you've been had."" Actually I think my anonymous sideshow barker is being a bit harsh, for this particular confection, viewed as sheer entertainment, has a lot going for it. . First, there are two strong performances from Hugh Jackman, and Christian Bale as the two dueling magicians (or is it illusionists?), Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Then there's a faultless supporting performance as Michael Caine, in wise old buffer mode, as Cutter, the trick deviser. Then there's the invocation of the late Victorian/Edwardian atmosphere, when society seemed to be so straitlaced and stratified, yet unimaginable change was already on its way. Lastly, there's the paradox that even though, especially via Cutter, we get to see the magic business from the inside, what's really going on is concealed until the end  and possibly beyond.

This is a long movie - over 120 minutes and I did get a little restless at times. The intensity of the rivalry between the male leads tends to put their women in the shade, and Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall were rather overshadowed (though Rebecca does the better of the two). Although the Tesla sub-plot was interesting, and David Bowie was a suitably cagey Tesla (the real-life electrical inventor), the leap into rather fuzzy sci-fi was rather out of sympathy with the main themes of the picture, putting on illusions and getting revenge. Still without Tesla there would not have been Andy Serkis's gem of a performance as his sidekick Alley.

As in ""Memento"" where the story was essentially presented backwards, Christopher Nolan plays around with the time-frame, but much more conventionally. Thus the movie opens with Borden in jail after being convicted of Angier's murder, but of course that is not the end of the story. The storyline is not a challenge until the end when rather too much is revealed at once. Still, the stars are easy to watch and the music-hall atmosphere beautifully evoked. Whether or not Tesla could do remarkable things with black cats and top hats, not to mention people, is beside the point; the story here is powered by good old human passion.",8

24 March 2007,Great Yarn!,"This is why I go the cinema. To be entertained. And this movie does it all the way through. Highly engaging, compelling, stimulating, exciting, the superlatives go on and on. The cinematography is worth admission alone. Great performance from all actors except David Bowie who just about passed first base. The period setting was totally convincing and the on stage drama the best since Amadeus. The intense atmosphere created by Bale and his stage rivals really keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The film really has the lot, including just the right amount of romantic interest but not too much and the girls are quite stunning.I would give this film a best movie Oscar.

20 November 2010,Probably Nolan's and the decade's best.,"The Prestige - It is undoubtedly Nolan's best yet. Better than Dark Knight, better than Batman Begins and definitely better than Inception. It wouldn't be an understatement to say it is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time. All Nolan movies that followed have been exceptional but still won't be able to match The Prestige. The Prestige is an instant classic. It will leave you amazed and more importantly it will leave you wondering, why haven't you witnessed this masterpiece yet.

The direction by Nolan is flawless, and so is the screenplay. The dialouges are honest with no hint of pretension. There is a unusual flow in the movie which helps Nolan switch from one story to another inter-wined story but still doesn't leave you confused. The movie from scene one is as gripping as it can get. And at the end of the odd 130 minutes, it doesn't end there. It stays with you.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are very believable as magicians and illusionists with an obsession to perform the greatest illusion. Michael Caine is very natural as usual. Even the supporting cast do justice to the script of the film.

But what really makes The Prestige stand out is the script. Full credit to Christopher Priest on whose novel the movie is based as well as the Nolan brothers for the gripping screenplay. I have not read the novel but I don't think it can better than the movie. Imagining magic happen will never be the same as witnessing it.

The standards set by Nolan in this one will be tough to match up even in the coming years.

But you never know, what magic will this magician come up with. The magician called Christopher Nolan",10
21 October 2006,The Prestige - promises and delivers,"Before going to this movie, you may want to consider reading up on Nikola Tesla and his nearly invisible presence in the history of modern electricity. I'll explain later.

Going to this movie I expected magic, love, rivalry and maybe even the supernatural. There was definitely magic, although the movie itself did not feel magical. However, that should not keep you from seeing the movie. There was love, but I did not love this movie as I was watching it. There was rivalry and plenty of it. And ""supernatural""? Well, I still struggle with that because one of the mysteries of the movie has quite an interesting but unresolved history.

In my opinion most people are going to see this movie because of the excellent actors and the potential for supernatural thrills. What I fear is that most people who see this movie will not know how to relate Tesla to the ""supernatural"" and magic of electricity. So, for your own good, check out Wikipedia or some other resource for information about Nikola Tesla. If you know the story of Tesla and his experiments, you will find the movie and ending even more satisfying. Remember all through the movie what the three parts of the magic trick are - the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Does Michael Caine only refer to the tricks the magicians perform or does he have a deeper message? Does Christopher Nolan have a deeper message? I for one, think he was very clever with the ending.

Performances, twists, the ending and direction make this movie well worth the money for the viewer who wants some intelligence out of a movie that promises magic. It can be slow but it gives you time to think(I needed plenty of that).

I pledge 8 of 10 canaries.",8
28 October 2015,One of Nolans Best films and a Mind blowing classic,"Watched The Prestige with Christian Bale(Batman Begins) as Alfred Borden/The Professor , Hugh Jackman(Van Helsing ) as Robert Angier/The Great Danton , Michael Caine(The Italian Job) as John Cutter, Andy Serkis(King Kong) as Mr.Alley , Rebecca Hall(Starter For 10) as Sarah Borden , Piper Perabo(Coyote Ugly) as Julia McCullough , Scarlett Johansson(The Island) as Olivia Wescombe and a Special Appearance from David Bowie(Labyrinth) as Nikola Tesla.

The film was an electrifying for a being enjoyed the twist and turns as were watching a magic enjoy also the ensemble cast did a fantastic job Amazing Costume Design By Joan Bergin(Dancing at Lughnasa) ,David Julyan(The Last Drop), Cinematography By Wally Pfister(Insomnia) ,and Direction By Christopher Nolan(Memento) , One of Nolans Best films and a Mind blowing classic 9/10

4 March 2007,A film with an IQ,"Of course the cast and director pedigree give an indication you're going to get a good film, but The Prestige exceeds expectation.

The backbone of the plot is simple; two magicians obsessed with producing the ultimate illusion and more importantly outdoing their rival.

The storyline has been superbly presented by Nolan. This is a film that keeps you guessing but, in a similar manner to the sixth sense, there's honesty in the production that means every pertinent piece of information required to work out what's going on is clearly presented on the screen right from the start.

Arguably the best of the year.

19 February 2008,Disappointingly obvious,"There are many reviews on this site saying how after The Prestige they walked out of the theater in awe with jaws dropping. Personally, I didn't get it.

The movie was a trick badly done. The ""turn"" is too transparent, revealing all the secrets to one that isn't simply waiting for the prestige. That is, by the middle of the movie, you can have a pretty good idea of how it will end. This would be fine if not for the fact that the ending is really all this movie is about. I suppose you might be able to enjoy it, if you're not that analytical and just take things as they are.

Personally, I enjoyed The Illusionist much more, although that movie too had an all-too-obvious plot.

Finally... as for those denouncing Tesla, rumors have circulated even until today about his experiments. The trick with the lightbulbs as seen in the preview? That was, and is, possible. Yes -- Tesla invented it. Tesla experimented with all kinds of things, including the technology seen in this movie. If anyone could have accomplished such a feat during that era, it would have been Tesla. This is a work of fiction so do take it with a grain of salt.",3

25 October 2006,are you watching closely?,"wow. what a ride. i have to say i was expecting a different movie but it was way better than what i expected. OK so here it goes. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden ( Christian Bale) are friendly magicians who share an act until one night something goes terribly wrong and makes them enemies. Both wont rest until the other outdoes the other or sabotages each others performance. i have to say this is Hugh Jackmans finest performance here as well as Michael Caine as John Cutter the stage engineer. Christian Bale is also good as well as Scarlett Johansson but unfortunately this stunning actress is used much. The Prestige for me is the best movie of the year so far. Hopefully this movie gets recognized at Oscar time. When you see this movie, pay attention very closely cause if you blink you wont get the ending. my jaw dropped at the end. christopher nolan is one of the best directors today and this film shows that. are you watching closely?

19 November 2006,Obsession and Magic.,"I've got to say firstly, Chris Nolan has wow-ed me ever since I saw Memento, all those years ago. He is an exceptional auteur, and wields the conventions of time, space, and suspense like a master... and The Prestige is indeed his masterpiece. Everything from the direction, to the ambiance, to the nuanced performances just sucks you into this world. It is perhaps no coincidence that this film plays like a magic trick. As Nolan manipulates the viewer through his 'pledge', and 'turn'. The artful misdirection within these first two acts, makes the impact of his 'Prestige' even greater.

The Prestige is a passionate lamentation on obsession, the likes of which I have not experienced since reading Moby Dick. Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) is the 'Ahab' of the piece, and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) is his 'White Whale'... or at least his secret is. Another polished performance comes from Michael Caine, as the ingénue Cutter, who is the 'Ishmael' of this story... And what a story it is.

My reasoning behind why this film manages to be so impactful, is because it takes the time to layer every character. No cardboard cut-out, comic book heroes here... Despite having Batman, and Wolverine as the two leads(LOL). This film makes you invest in the characters, and those that go for the journey will be rewarded with something that makes you feel... Which in today's cinema(that has too readily become a 'Snakes On A Plane/Gen Y wasteland'), is truly something special.",9
13 January 2009,Stunning film that questions the reality of the mysterious art,"Working in the magic industry has turned Alfred (Bale) and Angier (Jackman) into bitter enemies that are threatening their professional and personal lives.

With J.K Rowling's unbelievable success the answer to magic is simply Harry Potter. And though the films are undoubtedly good hearted and entertainment at its highest standard they do not look at the complexity and creativity of the world of magic and the power it can truly have, whereas Christopher Nolan's picture explores that gritty depth and delivers a bitter reality about the world of magicians.

Magicians, with the exception of the Harry Potter franchise, are stereotyped in a disastrous way in most modern films. The silly hats the awkward dialogue and the cringing costume designs make the concept of magic seem equally ridiculous but The Prestige looks at the inner torment of a magician and add a special something to a figure that was apparently dead.

Bale and Jackman deliver knockout performances. Bale particularly shines with a hard and truthful approach to his character. Both actors are helped along by a finely scripted narrative that challenges the magician stereotype and questions the existence of magic.

The film isn't afraid to admit that magic is all a trick but takes a brave step to demonstrate the tactical approach of the mysterious art.

The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige help invite audiences into that world and though designed to entertain, feels slightly educational as an added bonus. You will be tempted to have a try at magic once this film reaches its closure, which is a heap of questions in itself.

Filled with twists, turns, flashbacks and futuristic views, The Prestige grabs the concept of magic and puts a bitter spin on it using these devices to tremendous effect. The ending raises many eyebrows and is a marvellous question raiser that will require another watch that will no be hesitated.

Nolan's artistic direction from Memento and Batman Begins is present in this Oscar nominated drama. His close and careful shots feel free and exquisite against an artistic backdrop. The setting of the story feels special and appreciative, a time when people could recognize the surprising element that is magic.

The prestige is a fine mystery drama that questions the existence of magic through its forever twisting narrative.",9

22 October 2006,AWESOME movie! Worth a very close look!,"The genius that helped breath life back into the Batman does it again! Christopher Nolan's film ""The Prestige"" is a modern masterpiece.

I'm not going to give away one single thing about the plot (I know I know, I'm evil...), but I will give all the kudos in the world to the talented Mr. Nolan and his amazing cast.

And let's face it, ladies - when a movie has two of filmdom's sexiest actors in it (Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale)... well, need I say more? :)

So do yourself a favor and check out ""The Prestige"" - it's true magic!

3 March 2007,One of 2006's Best --- Overshadowed by The Illusionist,"Odd that in 2006 --- the worst year in 70 years in terms of film quality --- that TWO superior and engrossing dramas would be made about turn-of-the-century magicians. Odder still that magicians are not very interesting to begin with, at least not anymore.

Look at Sigfried & Roy. They put on one of the leading magic shows, with their tigers appearing and transformed all over the Mirage stage. Great, but then we saw a magician at Bally's (not the show's leading act) make tigers appear and disappear quicker than S & F ever did. This guy said disappearing tigers is the easiest trick in the book ""once you know how."" Then there's David Copperfield and his nonsense about transporting a person from New York to Hawaii in 2 seconds. Gag me, please! Anyway, both Illusionist and Prestige are set in the late 19th Century, when magic was obviously much better than today. In my opinion the plot line ""In 19th Century Vienna, an illusionist uses his powers to gain a woman of higher stature, once his first love"" is so much more interesting than a deadly rivalry between two master magicians. Both pictures are skillfully acted and produced, but Illusionist is the better of the two.

My recommendation: With DVD's for rent at $2.65 or less; by all means just go wild and see both films.",8

There are movies that a single one does a fine job (e.g. The Entitled, 2011). But enough is enough, and Nolan serves even more. Otherwise the only fair note would be 10/10.

24 February 2021,Christooher Nolan direct and writes from book,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlette Johansson, Michael Caine play magicians ""You want to be fooled."" ""It was for the look on their faces."" Two magicians compete for the best tricks. There is a too tight knot, and the girl can't escape and drowns in a box. Her bereaved lover seeks revenge. Bale and Jackman try to outdo each other. The two boxes with the disappearing and then reappearing man is the best, but how is it done? The answer is revealed. Supposedly Bale drowns, but he doesn't. Jackman is jailed for his murder. Bale takes his daughter. This film must be seen for it actors and plot twists. Michael Caine is so great to see. Bale and Jackman have similar looks. Johansson is always intriguing in that although beautiful her emotions don't project causing her to appear alien. Jackman's wife Sarah feels unloved and who wouldn't. These characters are obsessed with creating the three steps of a magic trick. Prestige is the third step where the disappearing in step two returns. The cinematography had to be like an oil painting capturing the times of 1890s and Colorado. The courtroom scenes are brief. The editing could be faster, but the occult tone is maintained. The score is great, because it remains unobtrusive. The major theme is that viewers want to see a trick gone wrong.",10

1 June 2013,"A film that left me impressed and amazed, and made me want to watch it again and again.","The Prestige is about two magicians whom have been friends and co- workers in the past, but this rivalry begins with the two and ends up destroying their friendship. Magicians are known for scamming the audience into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what the Prestige delivers.

Hugh Jackman was outstanding as this irritated, fixated magician gaining back his life by revenge. Christian Bale was just as impressive as the baffling and mysterious showman. The rest of the cast ended being acceptably and well done as their characters

Christopher Nolan in fact has a contribution at directing. The way this film delivers the scenarios between the different places and times is well done and smart. It is a possible to some viewers that the film, Prestige, will leave the viewers confused, and might not actually like it, but there will be others who will enjoy the film entirely and be adored by it. It is not for everyone. The film remains into this world of presumption the entire time until the end. It will keep the viewer guessing and wondering what's going to happen next.

The script, acting, surroundings, support, and everything were a superb.",9
6 December 2018,Nolan's first misstep? Maybe.,"This film is too smart, or perhaps the word should be convoluted, for its own good. Nolan has crafted a movie about obsession and revenge under the guise of magic but the execution stalls in many areas. Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite... With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart, the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways, except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end, the film's climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that aren't all that surprising or hard to guess. The acting by the leads- Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is top notch but that should be a given.

19 May 2017,The Prestige,"A truly great movie that keeps the audience anticipating what is going to happen next throughout. ALIST cast, along with a master director. A film that doesn't receive the credit it deserves. Doesn't stick to a particular genre and holds acting performances that I believe Oscar worthy. Hugh Jackman, the gifted method actor swaps his aggressive wolverine blades and plays a obsessive magician who holds every card in his pocket; the love of showmanship. However, Jackman isn't the only magician in this monumental tale of rivalry. Christian Bale also plays as his bitter rival. Bale, being the best magician in my opinion, although he doesn't hold the same characteristics and showmanship as Jackman, it is hard not to be fooled by the magicians mysterious ways and Bales tremendous acting displaying his love for magic and trickery. A love story for the obsession of magic and being a entertainer surrounds the movie, along with other hard hitting life events. Loved ones lost from Both sides, this tale of two men fighting against each other is sure to keep you guessing while you crunch on your movie food and it is nearly impossible to predict what happens next from beginning to end.",9
18 January 2014,awesome movie,"The prestige is awesome. I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen. You couldn't ever imagine what will happen in every scene because we must think a little bit hard. This movie has a lot of secrets. I love one sentence in this movie. ""Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled. "" The acting from all actors, especially Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) & Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are very good, they compete each other to prove who is the best magician and make a new trick in every scene. I think the prestige is one of Nolan's best movies.

21 October 2006,Masterpiece of allegorical fiction,"This movie works on many levels: and thats what makes it great.

The Prestige is a roller-coaster ride, a sweeping tale of intrigue and malice as one magician tries to one-up the other and vice versa. Twists and turns abound, possibly even some loops, as the movie approaches an inspired climax that doesn't waste the previous hours the viewer spent watching the movie (*cough* Shyamalan *cough*).

Like Mement, another Christopher Nolan masterwork, this is a movie that will keep you thinking long afterward. Not only must the viewer come to grips with the winding plot but he or she can also ponder the concepts driving the details. For me, this was a movie about identity, what people do to stay elusive and one step ahead of your competition, not to mention the results thereof. It still amazes me the little details I can remember and place meaning upon that I didn't really think much of at the time. I would put examples, but the best ones I can think of are plot spoilers (and I wouldn't ruin the movie for my good readers).

A few of my friends thought this movie was a bit too long though they still enjoyed it. As for me, I thought it the perfect length. There wasn't a moment wasted throughout.

The Prestige follows through with top-notch performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine with well-done performances by the ladies and other supporting cast members as well.",10
27 February 2011,Excellent again from Nolan!,"For the record, I have seen this film before, but this is the first time I've attempted a review. I will admit to being a growing fan of Christopher Nolan's work, ever since the excellent 'Inception' last year I have tried to see all of his work whenever possible. Although not perfect, this is a fine example of his work, a beautifully crafted story that is both compelling and very mysterious. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please enjoy the magic show while I write the next paragraph).

Every great magic trick consists of three acts; 'The Pledge', 'The Turn' and 'The Prestige'. Now, I could tell you what they all mean, but Michael Caine does it so much better in the trailer. But I digress; we're here to talk about the plot. Two magicians, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier are working together when tragedy strikes. Angier's wife, Julia, is killed in an on-stage accident. He blames Borden for her death and thus begins a bitter rivalry. They both set out alone to be the better magician and both make every effort to thwart the other. Eventually Borden creates a trick that Angier cannot figure out and from then it's no holds barred. In search of the answer he goes to America to seek the help of scientist Nikola Tesla. What he creates for Angier is quite mind-blowing and very dangerous. But the secret to Borden's trick is not what you may think. I think I've said enough and so I'll leave it there.

As you might expect from a Christopher Nolen film, it is very well made with great cinematography, great sets, costumes and, not least, performances. Great work from both Christian Bale as Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, both are superb in this one. Also great to see were Michael Caine as Cutter and Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe. And I must give honourable mentions to Andy Serkis as Alley and David Bowie (yes him) as Tesla.

I have seen this one before and so could remember a good portion of the plot while re-watching it. Even so, I found it quite compelling; I love the way the audience are drawn into the story. It may not have the scope of The Dark Knight or Inception, and it may not be quite as crazy as Memento, but it's still a great example of his work. As I said at the beginning, it's not perfect, I felt some of the early scenes were a little rushed and a little more time could have been spent on 'The Pledge' without ruining 'the Prestige' (just a little magician joke there). Over all, very compelling, excellently made with some great performances Highly Recommended.

My score: 8.6/10",9
23 October 2006,Loved this film,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
31 October 2006,Phenomenal...Simply Phenomenal,"There are few movies throughout the world that can really give you a great show and this is one of those films.

The prestige is one of the few films that i have really grown attached to as i was watching it. It provided an excellent and powerful plot and Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine had truly proved that they are some of the very best actors in the acting industry today. It is those three actors at their very very best. I do however, have to admit that it was one of the most confusing movies i have seen but after watching it a second time I got exactly what had happened.

But if you truly want to see a great movie and you are a big fan of magic tricks I strongly suggest that you see this movie as soon as possible.

20 October 2006,I was wondering when it would end!,"The prestige was god awful. The characters mumbled their lines, almost the entire movie was presented in flashback form and it makes you wanna fall asleep.

As the movie started I could vaguely tell what was going on, or whether it was flashback or present, the characters mumbled their lines as if they were scared to perform As the movies plot thickens so many times and it adds so many dramatic twists that you begin to lose count and lose interest in what's going on and stop caring. The movie dredged on and on and on, I was falling asleep. As I was falling asleep I was wondering ""Why am I sitting here, I can get out and get my money back"" and so I did, but I think I should sue for lost time and embarrassment. Short summary, this movie sucked. Interesting Idea, horrible execution. I would have given it a two, but it was so long I couldn't stand it anymore, so 1.

12 December 2021,An Epic Unique Film,"So in prep for Tenet, if it ever comes out I have gone back and watched some of director Christopher Nolans films and the one I have watched today is The Prestige, which is actually the first time I have ever seen this film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after a tragic accident two magicians engage in a battle to create the ultimate illusion and will do anything to stop the other.

Main Character Hugh Jackman for me is one of the most underrated actors ever in my opinion, he is mainly remembered just for Wolverine but there is so much more to his acting and he is amazing in this film. His character is so fascinating and you see him become more and more obsessed with figuring out Bale's characters trick that it takes over his whole life and it is honestly brilliant and I am surprised there was no Oscar nomination for him for this film. Christian Bale plays the other magician here and he is also great, his character has a really interesting mentality and these two actors really clash amazingly to create a great dynamic. It becomes hard to pick one to root for and that is what is so interesting about the two leads that there is so much moral complexity to both of them.

Supporting Characters Michael Caine plays a veteran magician here and he is brilliant too, his chemistry with Jackman in particular is great and their dynamic is also really interesting here and he gives a standout performance. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall have supporting roles and they both do great jobs, there chemistry with the two leads is a highlight of the film and adds even more complexity to the relationships here. It is also nice to see rare performances from David Bowie and Andy Serkis who are also good in there roles.

Story For me the story of this film is amazing and breathtaking, something as simple as a simple professional rivalry is made so complex and deep that it makes this film one of the most interesting I have ever seen. This film isn't really about magic, it is there but this is a film about rivalry, about obsession, about jealousy and it is one that needs to be seen. Also just like most of Nolans films the ending of this film is so gratifying and interesting that it really makes you think and you won't be able to get this film out of your head.

Script The script here is amazingly written, not only the truly great dialogue but the way the twists and turns are presented is literal screenplay perfection. Both Nolan brothers deserve so much credit for their writing of this film as it is a true masterpiece.

Style Some people would argue that Christopher Nolan is a star in his own right and you can see it here. The film conveys so much tension and suspense and it is one of those films that you really have to pay attention as it is truly detailed. It is slower paced, but I was so interested by what was going on that it never really felt that way.

Overall Overall, The Prestige is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Nolan has made many amazing films and The Prestige is up there with being one of the best and this is an absolute must watch.

Rating - 10/10.",10
29 January 2020,Perfectly,"Nice movie with an interesting plot. Excellent casting.Nolan, as always, is good at creating an atmosphere in his films.This movie is the first excellent work by Nolan.

20 October 2006,"This is the movie ""The Illusionist"" tried to be...","""The Prestige"" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually ""one up"" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.

In the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.

The performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in ""The Machinist."") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.

This is the movie that ""The Illusionist"" tried to be. If you were left disappointed with ""The Illusionist"" (as I was), you owe it to yourself to see this magic movie. You'll be happy you did.",9
13 May 2020,Wowwwwwww that was incredible,"That has slotted into my top 5 favourite films of all time at number 2. I'm shocked Hugh or Bale didn't win an Oscar for this, they were both incredible. 100% one of the best films I've ever seen. I can't believe it took me this long to watch this. Absolutely incredible wow

27 October 2006,Christopher Nolan Does it Again!,"I have long been a fan of Christopher Nolan's Memento and Batman Begins, so I was expecting very much from this film. Not only were my expectations met, they were surpassed. The genius of this film tied in with the subtle nuances of cinematography and signature Nolanisms (voice overs) created a masterful work truly worthy of the title The Prestige. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson all performed wonderfully with each actor fully melded with their on-screen persona.

Once again Nolan is a master of time and he uses this to a great advantage in a similar fashion to Memento.

Without a doubt, this movie is recommended with two thumbs way up. Missing this spectacle would be very unfortunate.

28 December 2006,Are you watching closely?,"Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The filmmaker shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The director makes his ordinary film do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.

So it is with Christopher Nolan's latest mind-bending masterpiece. It plays with you deliberately, as a magician's audience, makes you believe something, brings you into something which appears ordinary; believe me it isn't. The Master of Non-linear Film-making - Christopher Nolan.

Hands down Oscar nomination. If I had to guarantee one nomination for this film -- Best Director.",10

31 August 2008,Far from prestigious,"I'm afraid this film is by someone who made one great film and now everything he does is regarded as a masterpiece. At some point people are going to realize that everything he touches is not gold and I'm surprised it didn't start with this film, as it's really quite bad. The story just does not flow well, it is told in a very serious dark tone which just makes it seem too ridiculous and not at all believable. A lot of the dialogue is quite bad and clichéd especially involving Chistian Bale who just isn't up to the part. The story is an interesting one but the way it's told is not. Only in the last half an hour does it really get going but in the end it leaves you unsatisfied and irritated at the liberties it's taken with you. It says something when the best thing about the film is David Bowie's performance, yes he's actually very good. (4/10)

21 October 2006,This Movie is Excellent,"This movie is truly excellent. For some reason this website is full of negative comments on films. The people behind the writing and directing of this film are the same people that made Memento. The acting is superb. The twists are very well done. The trailers don't give away what the movie is about and you are kept on the edge of your seat until the final scene. If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it.

18 February 2007,Nearly as flawed as it is amazing,"Vastly entertaining period piece, centered around the rivalry between two magicians desperate to one-up each other, could have been one of the greatest mainstream riddlers to come along in some time. Instead, The Prestige tries so desperately to be the mind-melt it is envisioned as that the constant surprises feel suspiciously rote, character motivation feeling surprisingly laughable. Clearly, the Nolan brothers' dense script wished to outdo themselves, perhaps a tad overambitious coming from minds that produced the solid, compelling, deliciously confusing Memento.

Here, crazy turn of events run like clockwork, authenticity comes and goes depending on the scene, and viewers foolishly witness a plot inside a vacuum that does not contrast any sort of real world interaction with the magic-centric scenario. All this makes the enjoyable twists and turns that Christopher Nolan employs throughout the introspective romp feel slightly less impacting then they should have, at times even coming across as laughably ridiculous; which is a shame really, since this original cat and mouse tale still ends up being something quite special.

Banking on heavy replay value through inherent ambiguities that further enhance the mystery's shelf life, there is still an admirable amount of rational explanation to justify the increasingly unbelievable and enjoyable pace that will continue to indulge throwing viewers out of the loop if they do not, as illusionist Alfred Borden insists ""pay attention"". The brief narration may feel slightly condescending by basking in the art of it's own clever twists, but if someone had to be pretentious about the intricate script they have crafted, I am glad it is these guys. I just wished they would have spent a little more time fine tuning some of the individual scenes, since their ambitions often seemed to exceed a hard pressed wow factor.

Cast-wise, the always hard working Christian Bale seems to be the only one that truly owned his character in the period it was meant to take place. Hugh Jackman usually felt way too modernized, and the A-list supporting cast felt out of place, almost superfluous. Even Michael Caine, one of our oldest and most respected working actors around, here in a role that is written as the glue to hold all of these wild themes together, feels unnecessary and forced most of the time. All in all though, The Prestige is a treat, overcoming the awkward setup to seduce viewers into caring about this most irrelevant of fictitious rivalries with compelling, creative force by the time the stage curtain has lowered.",6

24 December 2014,OMG I want my 130 minutes back!!!!! EVERY NANOSECOND OF IT!!!!,"I can't seem to find a ""minus"" number on the review score, and believe me, I tried hard to find a way to get one for this profoundly overrated insult to the intellect and sensibilities. I see a lot of movies. I usually like movies that make me think. I usually like movies with plot twists. I usually like movies with suspense. Notice I did NOT say I usually like movies that make me THINK I want my time back, movies with more plot HOLES than the even astronomical amount of plot TWISTS, or movies that force me to SUSPEND disbelief light years beyond preposterous. That's not quite what I had in mind when I made my ultimately embarrassing decision to watch this movie, or worse yet, subject my wife to it as well. It's not enough to apologize to my wife...I apologize to all spouses everywhere, and I STILL don't feel cleansed.

Oh. Did I mention that this waste of both the U.S. and British economies is unrelentingly and disturbingly dark? Hmmmm. Lemme think...which character did I care about LESS. Impossible to decide, because I COULDN'T have cared less. Ya know...wait a minute, that's not fair. It's not the ACTORS I didn't care about. It was the writers, director, and producer of this insult to humanity whose feelings I refuse to spare. How did this movie ever get conjured up??? The term ""Movie Magic"" is perfectly antithetical here, although The Prestige DOES succeed in getting your brain to disappear. The fact that this got an 8.5 rating on IMDb is either a parlor trick or a typo. At least I hope so, anyway. If not, I weep for the future, and will despondently have to dismiss all future ratings without exploring the ""Hated it"" reviews first. Honey, if you're reading this...I love you, I didn't mean to hurt you, and please forgive me. In fact, YOU get to pick the next one. Don't worry, darling, WHATEVER it is, it'll seem like The Godfather to me after this.",1
14 December 2007,"A mess of a movie, in my opinion.","What comes to mind immediately in reviewing The Prestige, is a comparison to a similar, but far superior movie, The Illusionist. The Illusionist had it all: a great story with a complex but credible plot, great characters (especially Edward Norton as the Illusionist), and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. The scenes of magic were extraordinary and creepy, transporting the viewer back to the world of a master conjuror's stage in the year 1900. By contrast, The Prestige had a silly, trivial plot that just kept repeating the schtick of two magicians who were rivals for no purpose, unimpressive ""tricks"" on the stage, and the preposterous Tesla device that duplicated everything like a surreal photocopy machine. The movie also took huge liberties, jumping around in time: one minute D'Anton was in London, and the next in Colorado, multiple times. Played fast and loose with parallel universes and time travel, I guess.

I kept thinking, do I really care enough to watch the end of this movie? And why is Scarlett Johansen always typecast as a temptress/floozy? She looked like the early 20th century version of the character she played in Match Point, another loser of a movie.",3

28 November 2020,Fantastic.,"Honestly, I was not expecting a movie about magicians to be one of the best movies I've seen. All around excellent acting. I thought Hugh Jackman owned his role and Christian Bale was excellent as well. Did not expect to see David Bowie, either, that was an unexpected but awesome! The story was entertaining the whole way through, it always left me on my feet, wanting to figure out what was going to happen next. Christopher Nolan created the perfect balance of intrigue and confusion. Just watch this movie.

16 January 2008,"Now, watch closely!","This was a delightfully twisted film. As others have said, the mood, acting, staging and script are all right on. The characters are strikingly real, although it would have been so easy to make them just stage characters; even when their behavior is temporarily hard to understand, it is also hard to disbelieve. Where it really excels, however, is inserting an element of science fiction with the other ""magic"" so smoothly that it does not seem out of place. Most people with whom I have watched the film entirely failed to notice more than one significant plot element, not because what was happening was concealed, but because - well, after all, it's illusion, isn't it? Throughout, and especially by the time you get to the end, you don't expect to really understand. Only when you really think about it and discuss it afterward do you realize that within its own terms, it all hangs together beautifully.

Sometimes a film is so complex and confusing so that people walk out saying ""I don't think I get it""; but rarely do they also say ""I want to see it again."" The Sixth Sense was an exception; this one is even more so.",8
30 October 2006,Great Movie,"throughout the whole movie i was extremely confused and I'm still confused right now about it. however, the movie is wonderful. with the bits and parts that i do understand it is an absolutely amazing movie with so many twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of you seat until the movie is over and the crowd has shuffled out.

The acting is wonderful and the directing makes you feel as if the movie is written just for you.

i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is in the mood for a twist and a movie that requires a lot of thought, but yet a lot of excitement at the same time.

15 January 2007,excellent movie - a perfect clockwork mechanism,"this movie is excellent... the story is outstanding and the plot full of twists, yet there are plenty of perfectly fitting clues during the movie... acting is good too and the late 19th century setting is detailed and intriguing...

While undoubtedly entertaining ""the prestige"" gives you a chance to think about the endless conflict between lies and truth or fiction and reality, stage roles and real life managing at the same time not to judge the characters and leaving to the audience the freedom to decide where good and evil (if any) stand...

a ""must see"" for everyone, thought it would be wise to note that during the movie appear a few scenes that while not truly violent might be quite upsetting for a young public...

9 September 2023,Mind-Bending,"""The Prestige"" is a mind-bending masterpiece that deserves every bit of its 9/10 rating. With its intricate plot and brilliant performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, the movie keeps you hooked from start to finish. The rivalry between the two magicians is captivating, and the twists and turns throughout the story leave you questioning everything. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and thought-provoking experience. The film explores themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the nature of illusion, making it a truly compelling watch. If you enjoy movies that challenge your perception and leave you in awe, ""The Prestige"" is an absolute must-see.

23 February 2007,This is 'THE' movie you must see!,"We are a very finicky movie-going-group. We check reviews & friends that have seen a movie before making the rare trip to the theater. This movie is definitely one you will want to see on both the big screen & add to your home collection. There are so many different turns & twists that keep your attention, you will not notice the few slow spots. The only (slightly) negative things we did not enjoy were the overly darkened scenes that made it difficult to see what was happening & some use of very low sound tracks during some crucial dialog. This script has one of the absolute best endings I have witnessed in years - not one of us saw it coming, even though the clues were right there all along (think '6th Sense'). I especially enjoyed the fact that there was no gratuitous sex or needless gore. Our little group could Not stop talking about this movie & anxiously wait to see it again (& again).

21 January 2007,Like the Nolan brothers? This is a must see film.,"A wonderful movie with a twist to beat all twists . . . everything I'd expect from the Nolans. I swear, I audibly gasped in the theater when the final reveal happened.

Christian Bale is amazing and believable, and although I'm not usually a Hugh Jackman fan, I was even impressed with his performance. Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that ""The Illusionist"" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is. I am waiting for this film to come out on DVD, just so I can watch it a few more times, being able to (hopefully) listen to the Nolans' commentary track.

23 February 2009,A cool movie,"A cool movie that has a really good ending.

Directed by the same director as The Dark Knight, I enjoyed this much better.

The cast was great and the costumes were really done well.

For a movie all about English people, most of it was filmed in L.A., in a warehouse or on a stage - which looks really cool.

The set design is what impressed me the most. The entire film had to be done in late 1800 time period and looked like the real deal.

It shows a few magic trick secrets that are nice to know.

The entire film was just great from start to finish.",9
7 June 2020,Underrated,"This movie now absolute brilliance by Christopher Nolan, every single one of the actors make a great role. It's probably the best movie about Magic, it should be a 10 out of 10 or at the very minimum 9 out of 10. Even David Bowie is in this movie.

22 October 2006,"An entertaining watch, but unfortunately thin and repetitive","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way.

10 August 2020,Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever watched in my life. Christopher Nolan, never fails to amazes me. The unpredictability of the movie is very rare now in movies, a lot of plot twists, including Tesla. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman with their astonishing performances, beside of course the great Michael Caine. There will never be a movie alike, and I'll surely recommend this movie to everybody.

25 April 2016,top hat reproduction?,"The first scene shows about 30 hats scattered on a hillside. We learn later that Nikolai Tesla has this amazing gadget, complete with sparks and mini-lighting and then, flash... there's another hat outside? does it also work with cats? maybe humans too? The second scene has Michael Caine explaining and demonstrating how ""magic"" tricks are done. First, there is ""The Pledge"", ie, something is about to happen, in this case a bird-cage with a canary in it, then comes ""The Turn"", where the cage is covered, then smashed, along with the canary, then... ""The Prestige"", and bingo, the canary is alive and well... maybe? And the audience (one 7-year girl) smiles and applauds. The inference is that such amazement with accompany all the other magic tricks that ensue.

The third scene is in a court room where one guy is accused of murder. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks, and flash-forwards and if you can follow it all, then good luck to you. I couldn't, I thought the whole thing a waste of the talents of all these big-name stars.

In my rating process, it gets 0/2 for the story, 0/2 for the characters, partly because Bale and Jackman are of similar age and stature, and one or both adopt disguises that simply adds to my confusion. The acting gets a 1/2, since none of them can do much with such a pointless script. Then there is a 1/2 twice for the writing, production and direction. Is there a single really good scene, with memorable dialogue? 0/2

Different planets? It takes all sorts?",3
1 July 2012,I'm under no illusion. This is phenomenal!,"Move over you Nolan sisters because we have new Nolan talents in town! Christopher and Johnathan Nolan (the Nolan brothers, as I like to affectionately call them) already crafted a masterpiece from ""Memento"" with Johnathan coming up with the idea and Chris turning it into a screenplay and fantastic film, and now they've both worked on the screenplay adapted from the book, ""The Prestige"" once again with Chris in the drivers seat, he does not give a disappointing ride. I've almost seen all of Christopher Nolan's films now, with me giving most of them a 10, which is why I was incredibly excited for ""The Prestige"" and why my expectations were high. Luckily they were met.

As soon as the film started I knew that I was going to love it. It just had Chris' fingerprints all over it, a great feeling of scale and scope, which he multiplied by ten to give us the exceptional ""Inception"". We are immediately thrown in to the world of a magician and we immediately care about this world and the characters in it. Like all of Nolan's films, it is incredibly involving and sucks you in, making you wish it would never end! ""The Prestige"" is pure escapism, and although is much less confusing than ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" it certainly is no less intelligent.

Chris has a knack of presenting confusing ideas in an accessible way. ""The Prestige"" should be a mess with it consistently moving backward and forward in time, but with Nolan it completely works and helps to make it even more thrilling than it already is. The directing is stylish and the sets lavish. There's a wonderful Victorian atmosphere, with beautiful lofty settings, (such as the theatres) it's a real treat for the eyes and with a wonderful scores by Hans Zimmer, it's an equal treat for the ears too.

But it's the story and well-handled themes that keep this film ticking. I wouldn't read into this film too much, just like with ""The Cabin in the Woods"" all you need to know is that some friends spend the night at a cabin, all you need to know with ""The Prestige"" is that it's about a bitter rivalry from two magicians. Both of them as malicious as each other, although I did feel more for Hugh Jackman's character (though that might be just because I don't like Christian Bale as much). Both magicians rise to stardom, but once Christian performs an incredible trick (presented in such a genius simplistic and underwhelming way) it leaves Hugh in an obsessive quest to perform it.

The theme of obsession is explored deeply, similarly to ""Black Swan"" (although of course no where near that great!) and you, the audience, suddenly becomes involved too. The pacing is relentless, just like in any Christopher Nolan film and so the film feels incredibly long, although I don't mean that in a negative way at all, if anything it's positive because it has a truly epic feeling that's hard to wash away after the credits roll up. It's also full of mesmerising twists and turns that actually had me gasping at times! All leading up to a jaw-dropping ending that would be a tragedy if you knew about it before watching it. Of course the most genius thing about the film is that it's written in the same structure as a magic trick!

""The Prestige"" is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, who's up there with Darren Aronofosky for making consistently amazing films (although I do prefer Darren's incredible visual style). ""The Prestige"" is thoroughly entertaining and pure escapism. The writing and directing are top notch and deliver a mesmerising film of both quality and quantity. It is absolutely gripping and absorbing, making you try to work out the impossible puzzle with Hugh! Some scenes were heart-pounding and seriously exciting and the climax is powerful as well as holding a good moral. See ""The Prestige"", the world's greatest film about magic tricks!",10
4 July 2019,Spectacular Ending!,"You're not gonna sit and watch a 2 hour another great movie of Nolan. Also its last 5 minutes worth as a hundred other movies at all! You can't guess its end; Nobody can. If someone says I did, he's a lier! Don't loose this fabulous phenomenon. One thing is enough to prove how good this movie is: Directed By Christopher Nolan...

7 September 2014,"Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this.","Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this.

The dexterous Christopher Nolan has mad a movie on Magic and he reveals how intricately and deceptively can a movie on Magic be made. With so many intercuts, mis-en-scenes, it's tough to grasp the pace and understand reason behind everything till the very end. The intrigue builds up with each passing scene but Alas, it falls flat in the end. The only thing I did not like is the last 2 minutes when so much revelation is done is so less time. For the rest of the time, its stupendously outstanding.

The cast has done a prime job, especially Christian Bale. Hugh Jackman and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson have played their parts convincingly well. I cannot name the characters here, as Bale and Jackman play multiple characters in the film and it's tough for me to putting them and taking away the intrigue and mystery. Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia Wenscombe and adapts to it extremely well.

The art direction is one that is extremely commendable and needs more than a thought, the setup entirely needed vision and the director Nolan had all that and more. The music is extremely situational and wonderful as it does not interrupt the narrative and still holds a place in the memory of the viewer.

Mind you, this is not a film to watch for fun, it needs some brains to decipher this, to contemplate this and to get this into our head. So the prime most thing it demands is attention and some concentration, you give them to the film, it rewards you overwhelmingly and that's a great thing for a film. The cinematography is wonderful, some long shots at Tesla's place are really wonderful. The dark and intriguing atmosphere is well built up. Kudos to the cameraman Wally Pfister.

It's a wonderful film and indeed one of the best film made on magicians. Having said that, it's a must that we have our brains intact while watching this. A 4/5 for this.",8

11 January 2021,Foolish Critics or a victim of the Batman,"I don't know if Warner Brothers didn't market this film, or that Nolan was first attaining a real recognition in the way he successfully sacrificed the Tween/adolescent audience for the 18-40 audience and finally bring to life a Dark Night hovering between the world of Comics and reality something DC had not been able to accomplish before or Since. This movie is fascinating on many levels and I can't say informative but thought provoking enough that I found myself spending a few hours learning the difference bt AC and DC currents, and despite his brilliance what a ruthless capitalist and businessman Thomas Edison was (When you see most photos of Edison you see the stern and serious look of the businessman not the brilliant inventor). His ego was so bruised by AC currents being more logistical than DC currents, that he falsely put on displays murdering animals with AC currents falsely claiming it was more dangerous....but I digress. This film brought into the spotlight 1. How competition at a certain point crosses ethical lines, the human need that when dedicated to a goal attaining the means is rationalized and adapted to justify the immoral and unethical behavior to attain that goal. We've seen that in all sports (Brady-gate in the NFL, Ali finding doctors to create hyperthyroidism to meet weight when he was passed his prime and repeatedly warned to hang up his cloves, head butting and blighting ears, counting cards, corporate espionage etc. Unfortunately it's not something we become overly concerned with until there is a victimization the mortgage crisis of 07. 2. The parallel bt. The two magicians and fictitious Tesla vs Edison...without spoilers you find out relatively quickly which one was Edison minded. 3. The difference between wanting to be the best and wanting to be authentic and creative. 4. How we deal with rage and anger whether it's legitimate or misdirected and how dangerous it can be when left unchecked (we already know how that rage can be magnified when it becomes sociological...fights in the stands at NFL and European Football games. If home alone your disgust you'll pound the arm of your chair, maybe yell at the screen. A few beers and ten like minded people turns that into a bar brawl. 5. I'd say one of Christian Bale's most brilliant performances or most skilled cosmetics person because on first viewing well I won't spoil. Well written Mr. Nolan along with Tarantino perhaps on a higher level simply mastering special effects and cinematography on 35 mm film using sets as opposed to green backdrops with CGI. VERY ENGAGING, THOUGHT PROVOKING, ENTERTAINING AND THOUGH EXPOSING FLAWS IN THE HUMAN CONDITION DOES SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB APPLYING THOSE FLAWS TO THE CHARACTERS..THAT ONE DOESN'T LEAVE SAD. Brilliant work and better than the book it's based on.",9

21 February 2007,Miraculous cinematography,"I admit, I 'm fun of Nolan movies. However is really difficult to avoid comparison with his older masterpieces, especially the memorable ""Memento"" and yet this one is one his highest achievements undoubtedly. A few notes only that worth a few arguments: the very persuasive sense of the era of late 1800s, one of the most interesting of all times; he managed to give the deepest depth of the 2 main characters and the master Caine, at his best roles/acting ever, he fitted like the hand in glove; for a movie that could easily slip in the category of ""entertaining"" aspect of cinema ,mainly,because of the theme itself never did. Is the first time that I see the beloved Scarlet J and not ""concentrate"" on her at all, neither even comment on her; the plot and the mystery wouldn't leave my notice a moment to spent on her physical assets, but the serious part of the plot; that had never had an inch of chasm, neither left any doubt to the rather unbelievable, almost surreal happenings and scenes; the logic was always there masterly hidden. Also the Tesla character is as peculiar as should be; N Tesla was one of the most genius, non-conventional scientists of all times and the choice of Bowie added a lot to that feeling. Of course, last but not least, the astonishing ending, that one moment ago could not be expected neither imagined in such an imaginative scenario. Thank you Mr. Nolan once again, keep it on!",9
25 August 2018,Christopher Nolan is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever seen,"Plain and simple. You cannot dispute this fact. There are some filmmakers where from the very beginning you can tell that they are going to be legendary. Steven Spielberg obviously comes to mind, but I also think of filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and James Cameron. But there's one other name that I think should be on that list: Christopher Nolan. This man has yet to make a film I didn't like or even didn't think was at least great. From the Dark Knight trilogy to Interstellar, from Inception to Dunkirk, this man has done so many amazing things with film-making today. I have yet to see his first three films ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia,"" but from what I've heard, they are also great films. As for The Prestige, well, that is just another amazing films in a career of amazing films!

The story is this: In London, there are two men named Robert Angier (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Academy Award Winner Christian Bale). These men are helpers to a famous magician, but when a magic trick goes horribly wrong - thus resulting in the tragic death of somebody close to them - the two men turn on each other and become enemies, sabotaging the others' shows whenever they can. However, Alfred performs a trick that is so memorable that Robert is obsessed with finding the secret - an obsession that has tragic results.

I've already talked about Christopher Nolan, but now let's turn our attention to the main cast. First off, to our two leading men: Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally superb in their parts. They keep you guessing every single time they are on screen - perfect for the role of magicians I'd say. But they are not alone: Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia, a woman stuck in between the rivalry of the two men. Unfortunately, Johansson is the weakest thing about this movie, but she's not actually there for too much of the movie, so it didn't hamper the movie's greatness. Academy Award Winner Michael Caine - a favorite actor of Christopher Nolan, since he has used him from everything since Batman Begins (whether it's a main part or a small voice cameo in Dunkirk) - is sort of like the narrator of the film, telling us what has happened and why the men became bitter rivals. He is always entertaining to watch, so he definitely pulls it off here.

To put it simply: Go and see the movie! It's amazing! The vast majority of the actors know what they're doing, and Christopher Nolan...well, he's Christopher Nolan. Need I say more? Oh, and another thing that Christopher Nolan does well is twist/ambiguous endings, and boy does he pull it off with this one! Definite recommend!",9

16 November 2006,"Chris Nolan Does It Again, Bale & Jackman With Brilliant Acting","Because of Christopher Nolan's Brilliant directing and Bales Oscar-worthing acting on ""Batman Begins"", I came to the cinema with huge expectations and they delivered in every possible way.

I've never seen such brilliant actors these days with Hugh Jackman and Christian bale doing Oscar-worthy acting.

Chris Nolans does it again with a unique direction to the film, the story and script have been clearly had a load of work on so that didn't fail and with so many twists to the story this makes this possibly the best film in a decade. It will face stiff competition from ""Casino Royale"" though 10/10

17 February 2020,A modern masterpiece in every respect.,"A film about the parallels between magic and filmmaking, about the machine of obsession, about talent and showmanship, and with an ending designed to leave people divided between science and magic, realists and dreamers, skeptics and believers. It features my hands down favourite performances of both Bale and Jackman, it inspires conversation and debate, and it's pure misdirection over misdirection over misdirection in a way that only Nolan could have pulled off. It's by far my favourite Nolan, it's more honest, more intimate and more emotional than any of his works.

In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over.

8 November 2006,fun - but not quite satisfying,"An enjoyable movie which will wile away your time pleasantly in the company of some excellent actors, principally Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale - the latter surely one of the most interesting, intense and unpredictable actors working in movies today. They are expertly supported by the one and only Michael Caine, with a couple of delectable cameos from Andy Serkis and David Bowie.

The women's roles, though well-performed, are under-written and fundamentally unengaging. This is a regrettable flaw, but there is a greater one - a trap which the authors were clearly perfectly aware of, but didn't seem to be able to avoid.

The trouble with movies which have Great Revelations in them, as the story of this one goes to great pains to point out with regard to magic tricks, is that there is an inevitable disappointment once you know the answers. Given that the Nolans knew this to be the case, one might have hoped for some chasm of mystery left open. But it's all pretty much rounded off in the manner of an old-fashioned whodunnit. One can almost hear the writers' glee as they tied up another loose end, and then planted the trail that leads to it somewhere unexpected. The last time I felt anything so self-conscious was in The Last of Sheila, many years ago. What stops this from being as brittle as that film is the warmth of Bale, Jackman and Caine. Even so, for some reason the writers' minds somehow tick away audibly in what I'm sorry to say seems to me a too-clever-by-half kind of way.

Whatever my complaints, this is a very fine confection, full of clever tricks, and a pleasant way to fill a couple of hours. My feeling is that the Nolans wanted to achieve something more than that. Unfortunately, they haven't succeeded.",7
19 November 2007,It makes you want to see what happens next,"This movie kept me paying absolute attention to every dialog, every new thing that come up, and it made me guess ""What's next?"" every time, and what's most fulfilling about the movie, is that in the end, it answers all questions and leave you without doubts about reasons and motives. In other words, it has no holes, and that was my sensation in the end, that it created lots of questions that I wanted the answer, and it answered properly

The story is very original, and the way it is passed to the spectator is also interesting, different and original. It really had a good effect on me.

When I saw the trailer, I expected something totally different from what I've saw.

11 September 2022,An amazing portrait of obsession that gets better every time I watch,"This intricate puzzle of a film is simply the greatest thing Nolan has ever directed. A masterful example of cinematic sleight of hand, which is the perfect tonal echo of the craft of the magicians in the story.

The first time I watched I had a little trouble buying the Tesla stuff, but with repeated viewings over the years, the fantastic elements of the plot take a back seat to the most important aspect of it all: Obsession that drives men to a downward spiral of mutual destruction. It's like a two way Moby Dick where the rival magicians are each-other's White Whale.

Rebecca Hall is great in this movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as a priggish upper class showman and a down-and-out blue collar dude respectively. It's amazing to see Ricky Jay work- and of course Michael Caine brings a great gravitas to his raisonneur character.

Nutshell: SEE THE PRESTIGE.

Honestly after a lot of rewatches- my only complaint is I wish the black and silence lasted a couple seconds longer after the final line. (I don't like the closing credits music. I know boo hoo.)",10
1 March 2021,"Gives me goose bumps, every time","Every magic trick has 3 parts...This would be one of the most iconic lines of all time. I don't know if it's the brilliance of Nolan, the acting of Bale and Jackman or the presence of Caine that's made this movie the best movie of all time, for me at least. I'm thrilled to the bone everyone I watch it, which is like a million times! The music makes it even more haunting. I may be dumb but I had to watch this movie like 10 times before I finally understood it. And each time I watch it I find something new in it. That's what brilliant movies are all about. If I were younger and in another era, Id give up everything to be a magician.

9 January 2017,Wonderful movie; one of the best I've seen in a while,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10

21 October 2006,Watch Closely!,"The Prestige brings the magic to the screen. It's not in the tricks that make you scratch your head but rather the plot and twists. Christopher Nolan has directed yet again another movie worth the price of admission. Many say that it is too long, but (like every perfectionist) Nolan takes about half an hour just to set up. Nolan places his signature on the film as it starts out ahead of the story and goes back. Few could pull off this film due to the confusion of the story's twists and how to reveal them coherently to the viewer while giving off an exciting energy. The costumes were great and really made it feel Victorian. The one downside that critics had were that the characters were flat, but I think that it was quite realistic when all the twists are set out and you look into each character and their reactions. Overall a movie that felt genuinely well made and fulfilled its potential.

25 October 2006,Superb!,"This movie is pure genius from the story to the directing to the acting.

It entertained and bewildered me and finally crescendos into a PERFECT MASTERPIECE!

This is one of my all-time favorites.

I saw THE ILLUSIONIST which I also liked and even thought it was better half way through this one. But I was fooled. I have only received such a feeling after a movie finished when I saw The 6th Sense.

I will see this movie at least 3 times.

19 July 2012,"Starts strong, then leads to a disappointing conclusion","The Prestige is a perfect example of a film that starts off pretty damn good, but then falls flat at the end. It overall is worth watching, and is enjoyable and interesting in parts, but it isn't a masterpiece.

I'm going to start with the stuff I liked this time, the acting is great, I really thought that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman hated each other. The direction is great, it's a very good looking film, I think in terms of direction this is actually one of Nolan's better films. It has a good plot, even if it is far fetched. The production value is also worth noting, really feeling like the late 19th century, well except maybe Tesla in the middle, but that would be spoiling to much so I won't say what it does. Overall for the most part the movie works really well.

Then at the end this movie decides to have a twist ending. I actually knew the twist before, so I was looking for clues, like something like THe Sixth Sense, and what I found out is that this twist ending doesn't make any sense at all. This isn't even really a twist, it's more of a ""got ya"" moment. There's no clues, no lead up, the twist is just there so the movie can feel more cool than it needs to be. If any of you can explain how this twist makes any sense, please let me know.

So yes, The Presige is a good movie for the most part, it starts off pretty strong, but then goes into a very disappointing conclusion.",7
21 October 2019,Good film but...,"An interesting and correctly delivered film. But for me it's too long and boring. Good acting, Beautiful shooting, Costumes. If liked ""Inception"" you should like.

21 February 2007,was the intend to let the viewer to figure out the 'prestige' of the movie?,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

5 July 2007,The movie is about more than the trick,"If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the movie as so much better than that. Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger, betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death, disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember, though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove you're the best?

29 July 2023,Didn't Like the First Time I Watched It,"The first time I watched this I would have given it a 4.

It really grew on me with the 2nd watch.

Now, it's permanently part of the rotation.

Not a huge Nolan fan, but this one I really like.

It's like you need the first watch to prep your brain to be able to enjoy it with the 2nd one.

In that, Nolan might be the longevity master - because still to this day, the majority of Hollywood isn't thinking long term with their films; even when 'people wanting to watch something multiple times' is where all the money is at.

All of the actors are good, if not great.

The aesthetics are gorgeous, throughout.

The only reason it's not a 10, is because even though they're at their best in this, Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson simply aren't 10 actors.",9
7 March 2007,"Clever, but not highly compelling or memorable","A very clever film (not surprising for a film about a couple of magicians) that is so concerned with being clever, that it becomes a little confusing. I was left thinking I needed to watch it again, not because of the pleasure I had watching it, but because I wasn't sure I ""got it,"" completely. The problem was that I had absolutely no sympathy for the two magicians who were so self absorbed, and mean spirited in their relentless ambition to out-do each other, that I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. Also, I think it was a little too long for what it was, to the point of getting a little tedious. All this is not to say that there aren't some positives. Firstly, the cinematography in this film is outstanding. I saw this on DVD, but I can imagine it would be great on the big screen. The wardrobe and set design where excellent, which really helped bring an aura of authenticity to this period piece. The acting was pretty darn good as well, which is no surprise, considering the veteran talent in the cast. I enjoyed seeing David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla; he so transformed into this character that I didn't realize at first who the actor was. Also, it added an element of interest to call attention to Tesla the man, whose visionary theories are considered revolutionary, even in modern times. Although duplicating people...this may be a little much even for Tesla. But I'm no expert on Tesla. The Presence of Scarlett Johansson in the cast was also one of the reasons I wanted to see this film. Her role here, though, was a little on the insubstantial side. Not surprisingly, she is cast typically (it seems, lately) as the smokin' hot eye candy of the film. She certainly is capable of playing character roles of much more depth, as I have seen in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" for example. Nonetheless, I think she did do a good job here, for what it was. So all in all, I would have to say that for me this was a mildly interesting and entertaining film, though certainly not highly compelling or memorable.",6
24 October 2006,"A great story, but not a great movie","As I sat in the theater, engrossed in the kind of story I love  complex, intriguing, and mysterious, I wondered why I wasn't enjoying it more. I found myself trying harder to tie the action on the screen to Nikola Tesla's real work than to tie together the many seemingly loose ends of the story.

It was a good movie, no doubt, but it seemed a shame not to do more with a story that had so much potential. The problem, I finally realized, was this: there were a number of key events: dramatic, exciting, and violent events that were underplayed to the point of being almost lost in the background. After lingering over a rather dull conversation, the cameras would speed past an amazing and startling event, leaving me to visualize the event in my head long after the camera had gone on to another long conversation. Furthermore, I found it impossible to gain any rapport with any of the main characters other than Cutter, played superbly by Michael Caine, which prevented me from investing myself in any hoped-for outcome. Eventually, the movie just seemed too long.

Perhaps, the reason for the rather strange approach, emphasizing words over actions, was that the clues are in the events, not the words, and the filmmakers wanted to promote the film as a suspenseful story full of twists and turns  a movie that would challenge the audience. The problem is that there is nothing really very challenging about the movie. Anyone who follows the events will understand what is going on.

Considering the dearth of quality in the Hollywood product, ""The Prestige"" is definitely worth going to see, especially for anyone who is interested in the art of illusion. But, a story this good should provide a lot more.",8

21 May 2021,I wanted to become a magician after seeing this,"I just finished watching The Prestige on Amazon Prime. Recently I decided to take a look at all of Christopher Nolan's films. I have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet; and now it was this film's turn. At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing. After having seen Tenet I was overestimating this film. It's nothing as complicated (though it is fairly so), and that's for a good thing.

It's funny there are three actors in this film who also played superheroes movies - Christian Bale (Batman in TDK Trilogy), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in X-Men), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow in MCU), and out of them Scarlett Johansson hadn't even come up as Black Widow yet. And since those are the only roles I have previously seen them, it was a bit weird seeing them do basic, method acting. The only one I had seen before do multiple roles is Michael Caine (Alfred in TDK trilogy), but he's in every Nolan film I've ever watched so he doesn't count. And all their acting was actually pretty convincing.

The story is what mainly carries this film. There are two magicians who have two completely different ideas about magic. Borden is more of someone who believes in making his life more devoted towards magic, while Angier is someone who believes the charm of magic is more based on presentation. Both the magicians hold grudges against each other due to an accident which happened in the past, which is the reason they are constantly trying to outdo each other.

Seeing this film I got to learn so many magic tricks that I otherwise used to dismiss as simply being some complicated trick my tiny brain is too weak to understand. My take from this, especially from Alfred Borden, was that to understand how magic works, we have to go to the absolute basics. How something is happening, how we can convince the audience that we are doing what they are thinking and how we can do it so smoothly that no one suspects a thing.

This is something that we can say about science too, which was shown here by Nikola Tesla - what do you think is responsible behind what you see? If Edison had tried thinking it this way instead of trying to get to Tesla, he could have been considered just about as respectable while Tesla would have never been as famous as he is today. Though I didn't quite understand how exactly the whole cloning using electricity thing worked, I guess some things are better left to the viewer's imagination. The way Angier described how it feels to be cloned also left me in my imagination - what would happen if I am cloned with all the memories intact? Which one of us will be me?

Forget The Dark Knight trilogy, now this is my favourite film by Christopher Nolan. I only learnt about Hollywood movies a few years ago, which absolutely explains why I never knew about this film. But now that I do, I'm going to recommend everyone to see it once. Seeing all the tricks and, like I mentioned above, trying to figure out how to deduct an act, I also felt like becoming a magician after watching this film.",10

18 August 2023,Very clever and extremely unique! A interesting piece. Left slightly confused.,"""The best illusionist is the mind itself""

A extremely intelligent film! Nolan does what he is the best at!

The first 20 minutes is pretty boring and a bit confusing.

Its something very unique and interesting, the same time as it is a very usual film. I really can't understand the high rating on imdb, which i dont think it deserves.

Very confusing jumps in time. Not very nicely put together.

However its pretty well written. And soundtrack is very good!

Acting is very good!

Its a film where you truly have to pay attention to all the time!

But the story gets better and better through out the film. And the beginning all make sense in the end. But still confused abit.

Nolan is one of my favourite directors, but this is not at all Nolans best film. But truly a highly intelligent film when you finally get it in the last seconds of it.

The final hour gets pretty good and the story develops in a very entertaining way! It certainly a film you have to watch again to understand 100% of it.

I really recommend it!",6
25 January 2007,As good as it gets....,"After watching a movie, you log on to IMDb; you think twice before you vote for it. This happens, when you think of giving it a vote of 7 or 8 or even 9. But then, when you feel an obsessive compulsive disorder to give it a rating of 10( it does not happen very often, does it? ) you have to do it then and there, because you want others to know how good you felt after watching the movie. Yes, it is one of the best movies, I have seen in the recent past.

""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary...but, of course, it probably isn't. "" The movie starts off with this amazing dialog, delivered by Michael Caine. Yeah, you are right; the dialog is something ordinary... but, of course it probably isn't. You will realize it as the movie progresses.

""The second act is called ""The Turn."" The magician makes this ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it."" You wish you had observed it more closely. You are sure, if you had looked carefully enough, you would have been able to find the secret. You didn't; and there you are. You are not too amused, because you know that you too could have done the same, just that you don't have the speed and given enough time and patience you too should be able to do it.

""That's why there's a third act, called ""The Prestige."" This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking that you've never seen before."" Now, it is dangerous. You probably don't want it to happen. You are too overwhelmed by the shock. You admire it. You want to give it a big hand. You don't give a damn as to whether it appeared ordinary in the beginning. You just know that, it is unbelievable.

Let us do away with the metaphors. I can go on and on. To cut short, it is a story of revenge, deception and probably love. I would say the movie is sheer magic. And the magicians are Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan.",10
28 March 2007,The Prestige- A Truly Outstanding Movie,"Christopher Nolan strikes back!!!! He is one stylish Hollywood director who knows how to make you believe the unbelievable. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians it is also a complex character study about how self-destructive an obsession can be. Integrating this plot with a love story and a sci-fi twist truly makes this a masterpiece. The Prestige comes with a unique plot with a fabulous drama and an amazing star cast - mainly two powerful, riveting stars in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Pitting these two seasoned performers against each other was a stroke of a casting genius- it feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities. The director has very well recreated a period of show business history- an era during which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The script written by director Christopher Nolan based on a novel by Christopher Priest is itself a juggling act, bouncing back and forth in time, teasing us with a whole extra layer of suspense. It keeps you interested and keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end. A real entertainer and a truly outstanding movie, The Prestige is well worth seeing on a big screen for its grand scope and vision.",9

14 August 2021,Best Nolan blockbuster,"""The Prestige"" is gimmicky and pretentious but, unlike most of Christopher Nolan's blockbusters, it's sophisticated and fascinating without ending up being incoherent or unnecessarily overcomplicated. After all, gimmicks are more than necessary in a film about magic tricks and illusions. On a second watch, you will notice that all the clues have been there from the beginning, incredibly easy to spot. However, the film manages to do the magic and keep the tricks almost unnoticed until the three timelines converge at the end. ""The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know"".

Overall, a great story about how far men can go to fulfill their ambitions and feed their insatiable thirst for knowledge. Both characters are equally ambiguous and fascinating, even though Nolan clearly favors Borden's innate talent, dedication, and commitment over Angier's wicked narcissism and inferiority complex.

The script and editing are crystal clear, leaving no contradiction left. However, subtlety tends to be sacrificed to overexplain and keep things explicit enough for distracted viewers.",8

10 January 2014,A must watch movie,"There can't just be a better movie than this. The Prestige turned out better than any movie I had watched so far. A magician's life is surely more complex than what I thought earlier. I simply loved Christian Bale's double role. Michael Caine only made it too perfect. Hugh Jackman did his bit as expected, and so deserves mentioning. The movie definitely deserves a rating much better than it's current. Maybe very few people watched it. The Prestige may just be considered Christopher Nolan's best till date. A must watch for people of all ages. It deserved better than everything it earned-in terms of both popularity, as well as gross.

7 September 2009,Very entertaining,"The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians in the nineteenth century,Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman). Before becoming rivals they worked together for a magician but one night Angier's wife died performing one of the tricks and Angier blamed Borden. From that point on both individuals become accomplished and successful magicians and trough the years they try to steal each other tricks often interfering with one another shows.They get more obsessed, more envious and end up playing a very dangerous game...I found The Prestige to be a highly entertaining film. The magicians obsession in topping one another and the extreme lengths they go to do so, make this rivalry very interesting to watch.The story is full of twists and turns,most of them unexpected.Both Jackman and Bale delivered good performances and the movie was well directed.Near the end answers are provided to the two biggest secrets in the movie but they might not please everyone.I guessed one of the answers but the other one, I never saw it coming and some might feel cheated. Also it might not seem that way but this is a very complex movie and after watching it you should read the faq on the movie page.

8/10",
29 August 2010,The Prestige,"In a period story full of plot twists and lengthy flashbacks, two friends and stage magicians called Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) start growing apart after a tragic accident during a show results in the death of Angier's wife. Both are keen on constantly one-upping each other's best tricks and dedicate themselves to their careers with the help of their loyal engineers who design new tricks for them. So tough is their competition that even family and lovers become secondary to them... Who will ultimately gain the upper hand in the battle of the two masterminds?

The direction, cinematography and acting are all work of professionals. The dark visual style is skilfully created and the two leads are convincing, if a bit polished, in their roles. Of the supporting actors, the always good Michael Caine keeps stealing the show as usual, but Scarlett Johansson fits in her role of Angier's double-crossing assistant decently too. The complex narrative may seem unnecessarily twist-driven for its own good, but in the end the most interesting aspects of the film lie under the surface of the turns and revelations.

As the story advances, the style becomes less and less interested in realism. After the introduction of the famous real-life inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), elements of science fiction are introduced to the mix and strict demands of believability are better forgotten. The identities of the magicians, the difference between their acts and realities and the nature of their rivalrous friendship start becoming blurry and provide the actual meat of the film experience, as opposed to the less-than-credible plot turns that don't always feel quite right in the world of the story.

While I feel the overall atmosphere could have been grittier and more down-to-earth, The Prestige provides a fairly absorbing tale of the effect of obsession on one's mind. Nolan has examined the theme of hidden or otherwise unclear identities in his other films too, so The Prestige easily fits in his body of work and fans of his style will enjoy it without a doubt. Personally I would like to see Nolan return to more small-scale cinema where the underlying themes wouldn't be buried under the need to wow the audience with constant spectacle, but in the meanwhile his big films are among the best output modern Hollywood has to offer in any case.",7
27 January 2013,Nolan's more modest masterpiece.,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians, Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman). The two battle over deceiving and outsmarting each other as they try to be the better magician. Spanning several years and often jumping backwards and forwards in time, The Prestige is a beautiful, brooding tale about obsession and how far it can and shouldn't go.

Being one of Christopher Nolan's more modest films (being made between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and on nowhere near a larger scale), The Prestige is one of those films that only those who pay attention understand it's true greatness. With a typical Nolan-esque cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine), the film is setup for quality cinema and does not disappoint. From start to finish you are fixated and deprived of attachment to the world around you much like Borden and Angier as you too do not want to miss any of the films trickery.

One of the best things I like about The Prestige is how it deceives the viewer just as a magician would to their own audience. 'Are you watching closely?' a line which is repeated throughout The Prestige hints at the films very own nature. 'You want to be fooled,"" the last lines of the film as uttered by the legendary Michael Caine, leave the viewer in a bewildered state as they reconsider what they have just seen.

The cinematography is grand. DOP Wally Pfister who has worked on all of Nolan's films I believe, deserves just as much credit as the director himself. From the dark and electrifying theaters to the eerie Colorado Mountains, The Prestige looks fantastic.

Having seen the film several times and enjoyed each viewing as much as the next, The Prestige continues to amaze me. It truly is a mesmerizing and brilliant film which just cannot go unseen by anyone.",9

22 October 2006,Fantastic,"The Prestige was incredibly well-made, and I for one was thoroughly entertained. There's so much to analyze and pick apart with this movie that I'll probably be talking about it for the next month. I'm not going to waste time with much of a synopsis or spoiler. The movie works best I think the less you know about it going in. Just know that The Prestige is about an obsessive rivalry between two great magicians. Also, you should know that the writing was crisp and clever (must have been quite a chore to adapt), the directing was masterful (the structure of this movie is just as complicated as Momento-probably more so) and the acting (particularly Christian Bale) was spot-on. Highly recommended, particularly if you like Nolan's other films.

24 February 2008,The big revelation is a big let down,"""The Prestige"" is a very well crafted movie. The camera work, the lighting, the set decoration, the costumes and the acting for the most part are very well done. The way it flashback and flash forward yet maintains its cohesiveness and and build suspense is a testimony to Christopher Nolan as a film director and to his editor. Despite all this the big surprise the audience is hoping for is pretty much revealed to anyone closely paying attention with about 50 minutes left in the movie.

The film is about a couple of magicians who were co-apprentices when they were young, until a tragedy set off a bitter rivalry. The rivalry reach a climax as they try to out do each other with a trick called the teleported man. The quest for the answer sets the audience for a promise of big surprises yet in the end what we get is something so obvious and yet another one that is so far fetched that it stretches one's suspension of disbelief.

To me the only surprise is what happened to the Hugh Jackman character in the end. It's what happened to him in the beginning that created the bitterness among the two friends. And the Christian Bale character was in no way at all likable. But I suppose it's appropriate because it's when we realize that the movie is no longer about the revenge but about the egos of the magicians/showman. They are not just trying to awe their audience but also to one up each other. They want to come up with one trick that will make their fellow magicians envious.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very good performances, Michael Caine is wonderful as always playing an older magician who guides Jackman. Scarlett Johannson did a decent job although her English accent seem to change, very early on it was as cockney as Mr. Caine's but later on it sounded more upper class. David Bowie was a bit of a surprise as real life scientist Nikola Tesla. I didn't recognize him at first.

Over all I would say that as a period piece and a character study of magicians it was well done but it's main failing is the big promise and the big revelations of the teleported man, one was obvious and the other was ridiculous.",6
11 February 2020,Nolan's perfection in writing and direction,"""The Prestige"" (2006) directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan is a must-see - both as a film of great artistic and entertainment value.

A very original script, Nolan's signature smooth and yet non-linear direction, and a wonderful cast by Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansson, Hall, and Bowie.

See it regardless of, whether your incentive relies on a need for entertainment or to gain insight into the mastercraft of a masterful director - one of the best in the business.

25 October 2006,excellent,"Without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. where to begin? Surprisingly the best performance I thought came from David Bowie as the émigré to America N. Tesla. His struggles with English were the only governor to his genius. All the rest Bale,Jackman performed very well. I would give the edge to Bale as he perhaps had the more challenging role. Michael Caine comes to each role now with an accumulation of experience that makes his performances as taken for granted as richly designed tapestry unnoticed until you consciously examine the weave,cut,and design. Perhaps the only disappointment as far as acting goes is from Scarlet Johannson's performance although in looks as always she is a delight for the eyes. Obviously,to say too much about the movie risks spoiling it. The concept was original. The movie itself 'mirrors' the three parts of a magic trick. Needless to say the third part of the movie ""the prestige will not disappoint. Bill Hash

25 October 2006,Nolan's sleight of hand,"The first film of Christopher Nolan I saw was his remake of the 1997 Norwegian film ""Insomnia,"" and I found it brilliant. Since then I've been hearing a lot of recommendations of his earlier work ""Memento"" (which I have yet to find a copy of). I was also impressed by how Nolan maintained the grit while providing intellect to ""Batman Begins."" So it was but natural that along with Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" one of my most anticipated films this season is Nolan's ""The Prestige."" Based from the novel by Christopher Priest, ""The Prestige"" is a film that tells the tale of two 19th century magicians - Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) - who are in constant hostility as they try to outdo each other's performance. It is 1878 and Borden is tried by a London court for the murder of Angier during one of the latter's performances. While awaiting his execution, Borden starts reading Angier's diary.

Subsequently, the film proceeds in a series of flashbacks. Borden and Angier start out as assistants for a magician whose shows include the risky predicament escape: Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is tied and placed in a tank filled with water and while hidden from the audience's view, she must free herself from the ropes, and open the trick lock. But a mistake during one performance cost her life as she failed to slip her wrists out of the ropes and eventually drowned.

With Angier believing that Borden is responsible for his wife's death, the two went on their separate ways and become magicians as well. Eventually, Borden becomes famous with his ""The Transported Man"" act and Angier grows obsessed in finding out its secret. He sends his assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to work for Borden with the hope of gaining the knowledge behind Borden's trick but backfires as Olivia falls in love with Borden.

Angier then enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), who reluctantly agrees to build a machine that is supposedly set to aid Angier in performing what could be his greatest trick. What ensues is a labyrinth of twists and sleights of hand that to go into details is far too complicated. Let it just be said that the world inhabited by the characters of ""The Prestige"" is eerily dark and suggestive of the supernatural.

I had high hopes prior to seeing this film as I've said, and although it wasn't as great as I expected coming from the director, I still find it to be interesting and agreeably diverting. Nolan and his brother/co-scriptwriter Jonathan has paced the film clearly and straightforward. The plot's details are relatively concealed and restrained at least a few minutes before the denouement, wherein anyone who's been closely paying attention will know the sleight of hand to be employed by the filmmakers for the film's final trick.

The cast gives good performances despite their crudely written characters. From the exaggeratedly scrawny guy in ""The Machinist"" to Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins,"" Bale completely inhabits a different character in every film he's in, and he's always believable. Jackman possesses the strength and the determined fixation to lend credibility to his character's motives. Johansson doesn't have much to do here but she provides a feminine touch.

""The Prestige"" is finely crafted movie and a worthy addition to the director's resume. It suffers a bit from its tarrying on some parts and from its inclination to spell out so much justification from the characters, but these are compensated by the superior narrative style, good performances, and the opulent sets of the Victorian era. It may not be an outstanding achievement but Nolan is deft enough to make the film's illusions seem genuine.",6

10 September 2023,One of the most shocking movies ever.,"The Prestige.

After a tragic accident, two stage magicians in 1890s London engage in a battle to create the ultimate illusion while sacrificing everything they have to outwit each other.

Well, this is definitely not the kind of movies you'll watch once to get it all, so I went for another and this time everything was clear and I appreciate it even more now.

Besides having one of the most shocking plot twists, this movie is probably one of Nolan's most re-watchable movies since about magic tricks and it's very fun to watch and it the truth reveal comes to the screen... I still think this movie goes a bit over the top using a Sci-fi concept, the thing I didn't get at the first viewing especially what that machine really does.

The rivalry between Borden and Angier was the best about this film, especially they're played by two of my favorite actors, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman and directed by one of the best living actif director, sir Christopher Nolan playing with the time lines like usual.",9
16 November 2006,Breathtaking,"Having watched several movies this year i have to say that so far this has to go to number 1 for 2006 i cannot think of another movie that has made me sit forward in the cinema. Nolan has once more provided another great film and i now eagerly anticipate the sequel to batman begins hoping that he has me edging out of my seat once more. I cannot think of two performances in a movie that contrast so well as Jackman's's and bale's in the prestige and it is a compliment to their skill and the director Nolan. I also have to compliment the ending which was fascinatingly eerie and fulfilled the criteria of the film it was not a failed like that of the departed.

8 October 2011,"""Are you watching closely""","The rivalry between two magicians is exacerbated when one of them performs the ultimate illusion.

Yes, another Nolan film reviewed. This guy is a legend, but perhaps I should say with his more smarter films. Prestige, I admit, is not as good as people say it is. I do love the magic, and I do love the twists, but I think this and Following were purely experiments for him to mature in his movie making. Or perhaps that was just Following and Prestige wasn't my movie. The actors were very good and the acting was very good, the only thing I have to complain about is the movie. Okay, so, the point is that if I rate something I complain about higher than what I'm saying, it did it's part, but didn't use my part to complete it's part. Simple. Prestige is the movie that many people will love but many people will turn away from it. I think I'm a bigger fan of Nolan's blockbuster films and his more independent films I'll keep away from from now on. But if your his independent kind of fan and hate his Batman reboots and hate Inception, you'll probably end up loving this film. 6/10.",6

30 August 2020,Are you watching closely?,"My twin brother and I had just turned 13 when this movie came out in October of 06, I remember wanting to see The Departed but my mom wouldn't let me so we settled on The Prestige instead. While she went and saw Little Miss Sunshine, I had the best theater experience of my life (to that point) and I've loved the film ever since that cold rainy night.

I'll try not to be biased when I say this, The Prestige is Nolan's best film.

Audiences seem to complain about a lack of development in Nolan's characters. Not in The Prestige however. On a first viewing, audiences are transfixed by the two most believable stage magicians ever put to film, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden who are played awesomely by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden) as they tamper with each others Magic Acts and attempt to uncover the others secret all set beautifully to a post Victorian world. But on second and repeat viewings it is the ensemble cast that really steals the show especially Michael Caine who plays Cutter, a stage magic engineer. Also the two lovers of Borden played by Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall who is absolutely worth watching on the second viewing. Oh and David Bowie and Andy Serkis who play off each other extremely well.

This movie is absolutely worth the time if you haven't seen it please watch it and if you have, I encourage you to watch it again.",10
3 November 2006,The Prestige (2006),"This was a very entertaining movie from start to the finish. I found it hard not to keep my eyes on the screen at all times. Both our main actors Bale and Jackman fit each of their selected identities for their character roles just perfectly. Both show a wonderful talent in their acting and convincing roles in this most enjoyable movie about two magicians out to destroy one another. This movie does have a few nice surprises as it gets deeper into its story, making this one a movie to see for sure. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role in this movie and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. He did a great job. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie, with his unforgettable chance to play this role as master physicist, his performance was superior. This is a movie would indeed suggest everyone to see. Most entertaining!

6 December 2007,How many times a movie can trick you?,"I was told that the movie is above the average but I did not expect it to fix me to the chair for two hours actually.

I know it's been mentioned in many other comments already but I also want to praise the director as how easily he tells us the story with perfect flashbacks. If you watch closely (pun intended) then you never get lost in this very complex script.

As speaking of acting and cast, it's almost perfect. Bale gives unbelievable play and Jackman is man of his role also it's pure joy to watch Michael Caine. Johansson is very believable and quite pretty (oddly not so beautiful in this one though.)

I'm afraid the movie could not hide ""the secret(s)"" till the end for me, yet it surprised and amazed me so many times. I can see now how true it is that one gets fooled mostly because he wants it this way.

It's for sure that I'll see more tricks when I watch it again and again. This movie is one of those movies that is gives you too much at once and you need to watch it till you absorb all of what it offers.",8
26 February 2007,"""You have to bring it back.""","Adapted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan from the Christopher Priest novel, The Prestige has a number of secrets, cleverly wrought and carefully structured in an escalating series of dramatic revelations that may need multiple viewings to fully unravel. Tightly plotted and thematically well-crafted, the film offers converging lessons regarding seemingly harmless illusions that belie grim realities, charades that must be maintained off the stage as well as on, and the hazards of an all-important secret confederate, all coming together in climactic plot twists both haunting and unsettling.

Both films also emulate the three-part structure of a magic trick, as outlined by Cutter in an opening voice-over. In old-school magic parlance, the three acts are called the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. The Pledge offers the audience assurances that nothing funny is going on (please shuffle the cards yourself; nothing up my sleeve, etc.). The Turn is the moment when something extraordinary happens (and the handkerchief is gone!). The third act, the Prestige, seals the dealbrings the handkerchief back, say. ""It's not enough to make something disappear,"" Cutter explains. ""You have to bring it back.""",8
26 January 2007,"The prestige has a ""prestige""...","First of all Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman was a great choice for the roles and also i don't think anybody could expect anything less from the young but talented Christopher Nolan.Everything about the movie from the costumes the music to the atmosphere puts you right inside the it.I don't want to get analyzing the scenes or what happens to during the movie because i think that the best part is to go the cinema and just be surprised,not only with the quit different story but from the fact that even when you think that you know whats coming up next you will probably be wrong because you'll be surprised again.For me this is one the best privileges that a movie can have since when you are a movies fan after so many movies you have watched it seems like you're always going to know what is going to happen,even maybe the finale of the story from its beginning. Another really realistic and maybe somehow terrifying fact that you become aware of by watching the movie is what one can do to achieve his biggest desires. In general its a very smart movie,the plot never lets you slack. I don't like getting overstate but this might be for me the best movie of the year.It's a must see.If you are a movies fan watching this movie will remind you why you became one,on the other hand if you are not,this I think is a great reason to start being one.",9

27 March 2007,"A real gem; a movie that is thoughtful, creative and brilliant","This must be one of the real finds of 2006 for me personally. Not that my expectations of this movie were a little low but that I just thought that this type of movie could only go so far in terms of plot and direction. With some excellent twists, tremendous acting and engrossing storyline The Prestige came out as quite possibly my choice movie of 2006. Let me start with the acting. Just excellent, with the likes of Jackman and Caine and even David Bowie putting in a great cameo appearance. Christian Bale, once again, proved that he is an excellent talent. I think his range of acting makes him one of the most sought after actors of his generation and he has never disappointed when I have watched his movies.

The story revolves around two competing magicians/illusionists, who after an unfortunate event begin an obsessive game of cat and mouse to see who comes out on top as a premier magician. Both performers do not hold back to sabotage each other's acts as the game gets increasingly more sinister and deadly. The movie, for me anyway, starts off a little slow, but I promise you to persevere. The effort you'll put in to understand each man's motivations, to understand their backgrounds and to lay the foundations for the second half is well worth it. I cannot emphasise this point enough as at one point, I must confess I thought 'just what is the point here?'. But the movie begins to make sense and comes together quite expertly and as the pace lifts you'll be wanting more by the end.",9
6 November 2006,"My opinion on ""The Prestige""","I had been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced it would be at the helm of Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan (me, being a big fan of Memento), and became even more excited when i first saw the trailer. It looked serious, moody ,dark and just plain interesting.

Upon seeing it a week ago, i wasn't let down. At all.

I don't need to write down the whole damn summary for this movie, many others have already done that.

If you haven't seen this already, i'll just say that your in for a thrilling, dark, sad, violent,complex and enormously satisfying heck of a movie.

The thing is just very well acted through. Bale and Jackman are good as they normally are, and they aren't presented as one-note characters as i've read elsewhere. Their characters have motives for their actions, no matter how unjustified and cruel they are, and it doesn't make it seem like we should pity them for that, no, both guys almost hit the bottom of morality here. Michael Caine does a standard role for him here as the Angier's assistant, but he brings his usual charm and his always good acting chops. Perabo and Johanssen are beauties to behold,and both do a good job, though their roles are minor, especially Scarlett's. Hall is good too, and carries a shocking and very sad aspect of the film very well. And David Bowie as Tesla is one of the coolest cameos,ever.

The movie itself may be confusing, as it uses misdirection to present situations out of chronological order, but it's never too confusing, you get the time to organize every situation in time for the finale. The only grip i had with the movie, at least at first, was that it started very slowly and took it's damned sweet time on every minor event, and you might loose some of the initial interest or excitement you had.But at least 45 min. into it, it sets itself on overdrive and never lets you go.

Oh, and it looks bad ass. The production values are utterly amazing.

Just go see it, forget about infamously obvious twist ending, just let yourself in, put your butt cheeks in the damn seat and let the film surprise you and, well, entertain you.",9
12 August 2007,Read the novel instead,"I finished reading the darkly elegant novel ""The Prestige"" by Christopher Priest about a week before renting the DVD. Perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment, but the movie is an absolute dog; it pales in comparison to the novel. I have to wonder what Christoper Priest thinks of this film.

Call me a purist, but I would love to see the novel made into a movie that respects the story's original plot structure. Too much that is worthwhile in the novel, such as the addition of Borden's and Angier's descendants to frame the story, has been deleted. Too much that is ridiculous has been added to the film. The story has been butchered beyond belief. I realize that Nolan is known for playing with the chronology of events, but his piecemeal approach destroys any possibility of real dramatic tension building towards any sort of climax.

One of the strengths of the novel was that the story was told largely in the form of diaries the two magicians had written. This offered us some back story to give context to the conflict between Angier and Borden, and also allowed us to get inside their heads. The characterizations in the movie, are for the most part, extremely one-dimensional and superficial - completely without subtlety. The acting is mostly a snore, with flat performances from most of the actors, an exception being Rebecca Hall, who showed some emotional depth and engaged the viewer. At least the special effects were snazzy. But far more electricity was generated by Tesla's machine than existed between any of the characters, which is really too bad. I just got bored with it all.

If you haven't seen this picture, don't waste your time. Just read the book.",2
4 August 2020,"Probably my most favourite Nolan film, by far.","I had absolutely no idea about it, decided to watch it very randomly as it had good rating. Never really heard anything about it.

I thought it to be a 90s film - I've no clue about Hollywood actors age. And Hollywood movies don't show the film certificate in the beginning which mention the year of release. And I only look at the screen not the synopsis or any other details.

I was totally mindblown. I kept wondering if it is based on real life event as Tesla was a real person. Stupid me. But they didn't show any disclaimer in the beginning unlike Indian films.

I was totally hooked. Kept me on my edge. Could not determine for whom to cheer. And when in the end it said ""A Christopher Nolan movie"", it all made so much sense. 😂 I don't know why it is not as popular as Inception or Interstellar - in my area, and among my friends. Both are great films but this one is very close to reality yet so far.",10
8 November 2006,The Prestige deserves many prestigious awards.,"I was amazed by this movie. Everything is done beautifully from the acting to the set to the costumes. You certainly feel like you're immersed in the story and you've gone back in time to the height of magic. I was a bit surprised by some of the secrets. I won't give anything away, but I'm good at guessing films and this one I only got about 50% correct, which is really low for me. Even if you are completely paying attention, it's sometimes difficult to keep up. I almost wanted to start taking notes in order to figure out what was going on. Every actor is amazing, and the plot twists will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was a bit surprised by the addition of a science fiction element, but it didn't detract from the story in the least. This is a wonderful film, and you'll certainly want to pay attention when the Professor asks ""Are you watching closely?""

4 March 2022,"Still Nolan's vibe. Too complicated to understand, but good enough to enjoy","It really is. I have watched this movie over 10 times, and I love it every time. This movie is complicated enough to make us forget everything the next time we watch it again. I admire those who fully understand what this movie is about after seeing it for the first time. The only thing I found a bit forced about the movie: that Tesla was just Borden's code to unlock the diary, and that after meeting Angier, Tesla built him a real magic machine. . What? I mean, no such coincidence. Not to mention that if Borden was in prison- Borden was in love with Olivia, then why was he acting like he was the baby's biological father when ""Sir Caldlow"" brought her in? Remember, even with acting, Borden ""loves Olivia"" can't fool that girl. The little girl must know who her father is.

21 November 2012,Twisted My Mnd Like a Magic Trick,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
5 November 2016,An Incredible and Magical Experience,"The first time I watched Christopher Nolans ""The Prestige"" I didn't really know what to think I watched it in the wrong circumstances, I was on a plane and couldn't really take it in properly, so my first advice when watching this film is make sure that your watching it so that you can pay attention because if you love a good and mind bending mystery then you will love this movie just as much as I did because The Prestige is one of my all time favourite movies. The initial rivalry and physiological warfare that goes on between Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is a really effective plot device because you know how much it means to both of them to be the best there motivations are very understandable and the tole that it takes on them is truly intriguing to watch unfold. I adored watching the mechanics of the magic tricks it makes you realise how simple it is while never ruining the magic for you. The setting of 19th century is just a marvel to watch the production design is seamless and you can clearly tell that a lot off effort went in to it. To date I think this is Hugh Jackman finest performance it really showed his acting range from a happy yet naive magician to a haunting and damaged character. Christian Bale is also really good in this film he feels natural and it's truly disturbing to watch his life fall apart in conjunction with Hugh Jackman's. Scarlett Johansson also gives the greatest performance of her career in this film she's perfect at portraying the one thing these two characters still have in common. David Bowie was fantastic in this movie he's really mysterious yet somewhat wise and or definitely one of the best performances ever given by a musician. Christopher Nolan directed this movie beautifully everything from the editing, to the stage illusions to the little moments that set up for the final twist are all done perfectly and it do date amazes me The the academy continue to snub him. The final twist in the movie is just perfect it feels believable thanks to Nolans direction but is anything but predictable.

The Prestige is a masterpiece I have not one flaw with this movie it's got amazing performances, direction and locations it's one of my favourite Nolan movies by far.

23 November 2006,Incredible,"This movie is quite possibly the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life. Christopher Priest's novel is brilliant, and it has been some time that I haven't been able to put a book down. That being said, this was one absolutely incredible movie.

Frankly, I am content with it being a horrible adaptation. Christopher Nolan has taken Priest's genius premise and created another genius story. While I feel sorry for Priests, the Nolan brothers definitely deserve immense credit for a such a difficult task. I was completely engrossed in the film. It ranks, certainly, as one of the best thrillers I have seen, alongside Memento, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and some of the great Hitchcock films. It's hard to discuss the plot without giving much away (and a very simplistic storyline can be obtained from this website elsewhere), but I will say that the twists, even if they are already known, are mind-blowing. Keep in mind, however, that this film is a fantasy, or science fiction, whichever term you prefer.

The Nolans' script is marvelous, as is Christopher's directing. Michael Caine gives a very good performance, as do all the supporting cast members, namely Andy Serkis' and David Bowie's short roles. The very fact that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are in a film together is enough to see that said film, and they both give outstanding performances (as both usually do). Jackman does an awesome job as a gentlemanly sort of character, consumed by his obsession for the secrets of his opponent. But it is Bale (who stands as my favorite actor) who steals the show (perhaps the last parenthesized quotation reveals a bias). His portrayal of a Cockney ruffian is brilliant, and he, like Jackman, completely assumes the identity of his character. Both are equally deserving of Oscar nominations (and, quite possibly, wins), and it can unfortunately be a rare thing to have two such marvelous actors in the same film doing marvelous jobs.

The Prestige is one of the finest films of the year and may unfortunately be out-shadowed by other very fine films. It is an incredible story, one only strengthened by the fantastic performances of Bale and Jackman.",9
5 January 2007,The real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop!,"It's a treat to take part of this combo of adventure, thriller and character study of two rivaling magicians in London ca 1900. I find it so refreshing with a historical story and setting, that's carried out with such modern wit, cleverness and technique. And it goes deep into the dark sides of its characters, Nolan style, expectedly- it's certainly no more Mr. Nice (or good) Guy here!

What's more, it throws eye-filling images, production design, two charismatic lead stars, and mind games galore at the audience. And the real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop! But of course, it wouldn't be a magician movie without a punchline that outsmarts us and makes us lift our hats, like any great magic act. Juuust a tad long.

23 October 2006,Terrific,"Since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I will simply explain the basics. Two rival magicians compete with each other to see who is the better magician. Hugh Jackman's character becomes obsessed with one of Christian Bale's magic tricks and tries to discover Bale's method. Throughout the story, many twists and turns arise and I found the movie to get better as it went on. The acting was top-notch and the movie was executed wonderfully. However, the ending, which I will not divulge, had good aspects and bad. Still, the movie was so intriguing that it kept my interest the whole time. Some said that the movie was too long but I disagree. The two hours and fifteen minutes flew by. You should definitely see this movie which is one of the best of the year.

4 July 2021,Must watch....,"I just finished watching The Prestige on Amazon Prime. Recently I decided to take a look at all of Christopher Nolan's films. I have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet; and now it was this film's turn. At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing. After having seen Tenet I was overestimating this film. It's nothing as complicated (though it is fairly so), and that's for a good thing.

It's funny there are three actors in this film who also played superheroes movies - Christian Bale (Batman in TDK Trilogy), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in X-Men), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow in MCU), and out of them Scarlett Johansson hadn't even come up as Black Widow yet. And since those are the only roles I have previously seen them, it was a bit weird seeing them do basic, method acting. The only one I had seen before do multiple roles is Michael Caine (Alfred in TDK trilogy), but he's in every Nolan film I've ever watched so he doesn't count. And all their acting was actually pretty convincing.

The story is what mainly carries this film. There are two magicians who have two completely different ideas about magic. Borden is more of someone who believes in making his life more devoted towards magic, while Angier is someone who believes the charm of magic is more based on presentation. Both the magicians hold grudges against each other due to an accident which happened in the past, which is the reason they are constantly trying to outdo each other.

Seeing this film I got to learn so many magic tricks that I otherwise used to dismiss as simply being some complicated trick my tiny brain is too weak to understand. My take from this, especially from Alfred Borden, was that to understand how magic works, we have to go to the absolute basics. How something is happening, how we can convince the audience that we are doing what they are thinking and how we can do it so smoothly that no one suspects a thing.

This is something that we can say about science too, which was shown here by Nikola Tesla - what do you think is responsible behind what you see? If Edison had tried thinking it this way instead of trying to get to Tesla, he could have been considered just about as respectable while Tesla would have never been as famous as he is today. Though I didn't quite understand how exactly the whole cloning using electricity thing worked, I guess some things are better left to the viewer's imagination. The way Angier described how it feels to be cloned also left me in my imagination - what would happen if I am cloned with all the memories intact? Which one of us will be me?

Forget The Dark Knight trilogy, now this is my favourite film by Christopher Nolan. I only learnt about Hollywood movies a few years ago, which absolutely explains why I never knew about this film. But now that I do, I'm going to recommend everyone to see it once. Seeing all the tricks and, like I mentioned above, trying to figure out how to deduct an act, I also felt like becoming a magician after watching this film.",10

21 February 2007,what a trashy movie,"This movie sucked big time , i mean that with batman and wolverine a little more action was needed OK. The twist at the end was very much predictable and it went from illusion to science. The illusionist was better but not by much. Don't see it, or rent something else instead.So we better expect better from Nolan with batman 2. And Hugh Jackman with wolverine the movie. I mean Johansen was good but not great, and Caine needed a little more soul and heart like in Batman begins. The cinematography was very good actually, so was the art direction, But the editing and the flashbacks, back and forward, was not very good, and a little confusing sometimes.

22 June 2020,Gets better with each viewing,"The first time I saw this, ten years ago, I was amazed. Then I saw it again shortly after and thoroughly enjoyed the storytelling. Now, I saw it again and was again amazed by all the nuances and details that make this a truly great film.

There are two reasons I took away a star. First, I have never liked how it ends, or more accurately how much worse Hugh Jackman's character has it than Christian Bale's. While Jackman's character shows how being obsessed can truly go wrong, it is Bale's character that initiates the whole series of events and even adds fuel to the fire in later scenes. I probably would have preferred Bale's character suffers a similar truly awful fate, since they seemed so intertwined. But I don't feel like Bale's character does end up as bad.

Second, the movie is long. I appreciate movies that don't end after 1.5 hours, but this is one which probably could have. The storyline is great and the pace builds to a great finish. However, it drags in the second half. This may have been by design to build the anticipation and set the ending, but it definitely feels like it is dragging. I could see myself falling asleep, as I'm pretty sure my wife and in-laws did while watching it.

So I listed the bad, what about the good. Well, long story short, it is everything. The acting is top notch, the plot and twists are great, the background music and cinematography are excellent, it is just a great, better yet, outstanding film. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are enough in themselves to give this a watch. Add in that it is a Christopher Nolan film and my question if you haven't seen it yet, is why not? Do yourself a favor and watch it. Just don't start too late or if you are tired, as you may fall asleep.",9
2 December 2006,Just Plain WOW,"I am not one to recommend any movie to anyone because I have eclectic taste when it comes to everything. HOWEVER, this movie is incredible! The visuals are stunning, the twists are perplexing, and I applaud the costume designer for an incredible job presenting the time period without being over-the-top. What an amazing story line with the right combination of love, hate, science, magic, action and adventure! Fewer movies are being created with the energy and passion of The Prestige. Not a line or shot is wasted - and the 2+ hours run time flies by. For me, it was truly a pleasure to see David Bowie back on the big screen and playing such a key role. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are wonderful eye candy - but the depth of each of their characters draws you in as well. Perfect in every way - and in my top 10 movies of all-time!

19 July 2013,nonsense,"Rewatching The prestige on TV affirmed in the most definite way the impression I've formed regarding the cinema of Christopher Nolan:very ambitious but not having the faintest idea where it is heading.One should compare Nolan with Lynch(though I feel I'm getting blasphemous here) to understand how to tell the authentic and ingenious from the trivial and fake.Nolan comes again and again with ideas he believes are groundbreaking, and he finds his audience, I understand, but the whole concept of his movies is so pointless again and again (take Inception, The prestige, even the Batmans for examples), the final result incoherent for no reason at all(for there is incoherence that is meaningful, as Lynch and other great modern directors teach us), but for the reason of impressing the audience that buys the product the way they would eat up a blockbuster that is made following certain codes.To me it is a mystery how Nolan gets funding for these ridiculous scripts, and a greater mystery how he finally meets commercial success. But about this mystery I would like Lynch to make a movie, and definitely not Nolan himself.",2
23 March 2015,Nolan Weaves Magic - Abracadabra!,"""Are you watching closely?"" Just as magicians use this gibe on their audience, the makers here keep constantly nudging its audience throughout this tricky thriller. The Prestige is a carefully crafted story of trickery and deception of two rival magicians in Victorian England, directed by the greatest magician of them all: Christopher Nolan. It is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians.

Set in a world of top hats, cravats and disappearing bunnies, The Prestige tells the tale of Alfred Bowden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman), who start out as fledgling magician apprentices. They get locked in a bitter feud after the death of an assistant in an illusion gone wrong and subsequently go in search of the ultimate trick. As their quest to become the greatest magician becomes resilient, the counter maneuvers escalate and elevate each man to greater achievement in their desire to be the best. Just when it seems clear that Borden's obsession could only be satisfied by Angier's death, the film turns in on itself again, and we're left searching the stage for clues, grow even more anxious for the big prestige. Soon, flashbacks switch to flash forwards, and quickly we're entangled in a murky conundrum. But that's all I will say. You wouldn't want me to spoil the prestige for you now!

Nolan keeps the mood eerie and unsettling, and with all its Gothic trimmings The Prestige comes to feel like a slow-burn horror movie. There are nifty tricks galore up the sumptuous sleeve of this mystifying and wildly entertaining thriller, about obsession, secrets and lies. As is his want, Nolan jumps between time periods and voice-overs with reckless abandon. The movie's real trick is that it all somehow manages to congeal. You know all along you're being misdirected by cinematic sleight of hand, but you can't avoid being sucked in and that is Nolan's greatest triumph. Of course, he is ably buoyed by a pair of carefully complex performances from his superb lead cast who weave the film's heftier ideas seamlessly into the breathable fabric of a great thriller.

Nolan has been exploring the dual nature of man throughout his extraordinary career. With The Prestige though, Nolan takes this aspect to new realms. He directs the film exactly like a great trick, so you want to see it again the second it's over. You will leave the cinema posed with the exact same question ""Was I watching closely?""",10
26 December 2006,The Prestige,"In a time where the same ideas are rehashed, The Prestige brings the age old revenge story into a refreshing and consuming light. The movie, though long, keeps the viewers' attention and has every mind trying to figure out the story before it even comes to an end, however, a second viewing of the movie might prove better than the first; for those who love to solve mysteries. Upon the second viewing is when subtle clues become more clear and the ending of the film becomes much more believable. A great story is only great when it can be told and seen more than once, and the Prestige gives its audience more than enough fuel to suggest it to other movie goers, and of course, attend the movie with them.

23 October 2006,Plot Twists ad infinitum,"The word ""discombobulated"" comes to mind. I missed a lot of the dialog either thru deafness or the English dialects (or both); there were one (or more) too many flashbacks; but more importantly there were so many plot twists, I suspect that if there are any holes in the plot (which wouldn't surprise me) no one would be able to detect them unless they had a copy of the film and jotted down each fact (or illusion) as it transpires. No fair checking Christopher Priest's novel or the Nolan brother's(?) screenplay.

At the end of the film, you ought to at least know how many Borden's and how many Angier's there were (are). And how many died (if any). If someone produces a film with more plot twists than ""Prestige"", will that make it a better film? Overkill! No thank you.

16 May 2014,Nolan's Masterpiece,"Up until very recently I had Inception as my favorite Christopher Nolan movie and quite frankly I thought that the remaining movies I had to watch weren't up to the task of dethroning it. With Following and Insomnia still in my list to watch, The Prestige is now the movie to beat. With a simple story about a rivalry between two magicians lies a complex script full of symbolism and that itself is presented as an illusion. Combined with Nolan's mastery in technical aspects and you've got yourself an enthralling movie that will leave you asking questions long after its finished (much like Inception did for me).

Like I said this whole movie feels like an illusion and it's like the audience is being played. The question is will you want to be fooled? Or will you want to find out the secret. I won't go into plot details as I feel you should watch this with as little info about it as possible. About what I found was great in the movie, of course the technique put in by the crew complimented the movie very well. In a movie like this, though, the performances are the key to connecting with the audience and both Jackman and Bale show why they are the top talent today. Scarlett Johansson,Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine and even David Bowie contribute well to the movie and only add to its greatness. Some people might condemn it for being over explanatory, but personally I don't believe this to be a problem as I still questioned a lot of things after the movie was over. See it for yourself and find out if you were fooled. For me it was definitely worth it.

Rating 9,5/10",10
27 August 2019,Start of a Fantastic New Genre!!!,"This film was fantastic! So exciting, you never knew what was going to happen and it was so cool because it was magic! Other films followed this one, dealing in magic makers, their crews, their tricks and turns and I love them all. As many more films like this you make, that is how many billions of dollars you can make from them. We love MAGIC! We love the teams formed to create magnificent illusions. Bring it on!

3 March 2007,Okay-Good,"Two Magicians Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) who were once friends now are intent on destroying the other by learning each others' magic secrets. Sounds like this will be very good, doesn't it?

""There are 3-parts to a magic act"" as Cuttter (Caine) tells us in the beginning and at the end of the movie, the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Who knew? You want me to tell you what each one is, don't you? Not going to happen. I just like the parts where now you see it, now you don't; or where you see nothing and then you see something. Anyway, now you know there will be twists and turns and that is what you expect to see, and you are not disappointed.

The beginning of this movie is somewhat confusing, but it all works out and yet, there are still some parts I am not up on. I might have to see this again. They go into flashbacks and somehow you have to keep telling yourself it is a flashback you think. See? Troubles there too. And, the problem with the flashbacks have to do with a murder that you didn't see happen and that was confusing until the last 10-minutes. It was confusing because I kept asking myself for most of the movie, how was the murder committed? Why is this person in jail? See? Was I misdirected by the Director who knows misdirection is the key to magic? Hmmmm.

The audio (or was it the English accents) was a problem for some of the dialogue that I couldn't get, but otherwise the cinematography, the dialogue in general, and the acting performances were okay. However, I keep thinking that Christian Bale was not right for the role he played. I don't think he brought his ""A"" game. Is there another Batman film in his future? Wasn't truly aware that David Bowie (he played Tesla) was in this. He is outstanding. And, when he spoke I said ""that sounds like Pierce Brosnan, imitating a slow-talking Chinaman speaking very good English."" It was great. I loved it. Michael Caine is always good and he is the only Englishman I can understand easily. As for Scarlett Johansson, I wasn't aware she was in this movie also (I don't look at the box). She is, as always, excellent, but needs a movie with more lines. We don't see enough of her.

Again, some humor might have helped this production, as things were played much too seriously, and, there were too many scenes that were too dark to really see what was going on. And, you will never guess the outcome in the last 10-minutes. And, after you see the outcome, you may want to see the movie again to be sure you understood what you thought you understood. Save me a seat as I need to catch up on some things too.

But, despite some shortcomings, this is a good movie, not as good as The Illusionist, but okay-good.

27 January 2007,is this the actual ending?,"THE PLOT: Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier rise to become world-renowned stage magicians. Early in their careers, they meet and a bitter feud develops as they constantly try to out-do, and even sabotage, the other's acts The events of the past are revealed primarily through each of the magicians' diaries. Borden develops an act called The Transported Man, and an improved version named The New Transported Man, which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye and without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous acts to shame. Although never explicitly revealed, it seems probable that the secret of The Transported Man is that Borden, all his life, has been two people; his trick involves extreme use of a twin brother as a double, to the extent that they both live the same life. Angier cannot discern the method that Borden uses and desperately tries to equal him, and with the help of the acclaimed physicist Nikola Tesla For Angier's trick, Tesla successfully creates a device capable of teleporting a being from one place to another, but which has a surprising side-effect.

THE ENDING!!! The first time WHEN angier uses the device in his workshop alone, one of two things happen. The first interpretation is that the original Angier shoots his newly-materialized duplicate dead on the spot. In subsequent uses of the machine for public performance, the original is dropped through a trapdoor into a tank of water, drowning him, leaving only the new ""transported"" Angier alive. However, it can be argued that the first time Angier uses the device, the first duplicate killed the original, and the other duplicates drowned during the performances. It is believed that the Angier in the new location is a duplicate, and their personalities are exactly alike. The final scene of the movie reveals a long dark corridor, the walls lined with metal-reinforced glass tanks, each containing a secretly-drowned Angier.

Borden again breaks into the backstage area. However this time he sees one of the clones drowning. He is seen watching Angier die, accused of murdering Angier, and sentenced to death by hanging. In the end one of the brothers dies while the other lives on to take revenge on Angier, killing him amid his deceased duplicates RATING 8.5\10",8
21 October 2006,Be Ready For A Moral Wild Ride,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

19 January 2010,Are you watching closely?,"Chris Nolan does it again, he keeps churning out incredible films one after another. The Prestige is no exception. The first line of the film is by far the most important line, ""Are you watching closely?"". The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was only a good movie, maybe a 7/10... but after seeing it a few more times, I was amazed at what I had missed. Christian Bale had another outstanding performance alongside Michael Caine and Nolan (They're quite the team). And Hugh Jackman delivers what could be his best performance yet. Even David Bowie was quite good! I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, but make sure you watch it closely!!!

31 August 2023,A magic trick - packed with unexpected twists and turns.,"The storytelling in ""The Prestige"" is seriously clever - the way the story unfolds in a non-linear way adds a whole lot of complexity and intrigue. It's like a puzzle that keeps you wondering.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale totally bring it as rival magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Their performances are top-notch, giving the characters some real depth as their motivations change and evolve.

And this movie really makes you think, diving into themes like obsession, sacrifice, ethics, and what it costs to chase your dreams. These themes add a bunch of layers to the story and get you pondering the moral dilemmas the characters face.

3 March 2007,*******WOW****** Best I've seen in awhile!,"Those reviewers who give The Prestige low marks don't appreciate Christopher Nolan's talents and couldn't keep up mentally with the movie's direction. Christopher Nolan is indeed the best director in the mystery genre and creating wonderful plot twists with deep character development.

The Prestige will keep you guessing from beginning towards the end. About 99.9% of movies that I watch, I guess at every turn what will happen but this movie will kept me wondering until the end... The acting is superb as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are pitted against each other as rival magicians. I'm unable to see any other actors other than Bale and Jackman in the characters they played. Excellent casting with the rest of the supporting actors; Michael Caine, Scarlett, Bowie....

Must see!

31 December 2020,Never Enough!,"Really neat paradigm of Christopher Nolan's movie with his brother Jonathan's script. Super clean and well-explained, therefore this movie doesn't brings the aftertaste. Love the multi-line narration and sophisticated montage. Lack of mesmerizing music (of course without Hans Zimmer), resonance with audience, and connection to audience. An ok movie but definitely not the director's best work. One more thing, I didn't know Scarlett Johansson was in the movie so that was a surprise.

14 July 2007,"fascinating, impressive and extraordinary","Honestly i can say that, the Prestige engraves claps. The story is fascinating and gives some clues to spectators. If careful eyes watch the movie, it will be enough to understand the film, but watching the film more than once helps spectators to get the details and helps them to enjoy the film. When i see the film second time, i realize that there are really too many clues that prepare spectators to the end of the film.

The start and the end of the film is well, but there are some boring scenes in the middle of the film.

The sound of Tesla's invention is a bit disturbing. We had to plug our ears in these scenes.

Christian Bale's and Hugh Jackman's capabilities worth to be seen. It is a good job of Nolan.",9
10 December 2022,Complex and Fantastic,"Pay close attention! This is a film that requires the audience's attention. The character development is so great in The Prestige, and it's amazing to see actors Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman totally rock the roles in this film. The twists, some more predictable than others, really create an illusion within the film, and it's breathtaking. The complexity in Nolan's writing always seems to amaze me, but this has the potential to definitely be one of his best. The story is phenomenal and even if you aren't a real big fan of magic, this film is something that you'll be able to get into and watch.

Overall, 9/10.

25 October 2006,Excellent film!! Must see again!!!,"I've been disappointed with the films that have come out this year, (With only a few exceptions) until I saw ""The Prestige"" this last Saturday. The casting was excellent, the screenplay was spectacular, and to me this film was both eye and mind candy. Director Christopher Nolan (Director and screenplay writer of last summer's box office hit, Batman Begins.) Creates a truly unique and almost surreal atmosphere to the movie that although is artificial, seems as if there is some sort of basis of authenticity whether it's in the screenplay or in its brilliant cinematography shots throughout the film. I believe ""The Prestige"" is Oscar worthy and should get superb recognition for its outstanding quality as a film.

5 January 2007,Its a movies where you have to wonder if you're looking carefully enough and following the plot.,"This is an outstanding performance of the actors combined with tremendous plotting technique. It surprises the audience and generates an atmosphere of mystery and magic. The whole time from the very beginning of the play you concentrate on looking close enough to find the scam hidden behind the actors actions. No matter how much you focus you will still be surprised. I love the idea of the *special trick that Borden has thought of and the other man is trying to steal it from him. All the time he makes life harder for himself and tries to find out the real* way to do it. In the end he finds out that it was a very easy trick because Borden used a double..his own twin...and he says : ""Life is easy, why do you make it so much complicated?"" This is the whole point of the movie!..We try to look sooo close that we search for something ultimately complicated, whilst it's straight forward and easy. We look for so much more than there is in reality. It is like a metaphor of life and the human society. It shows the natural norms of the human behaviour.",10

22 December 2006,"almost, but not quite","Every once in a while there comes a movie that is captivating. When watching such a movie, one forgets that he or she is even watching a fictitious story at all, and when such a movie ends, movie-goers excitedly try to remember every last detail of its plot and try to more fully appreciate every intricacy that went into it. More often, however, there are movies that seem to have all of that in the works, but just miss the mark. Christopher Nolan's (Batman Begins) newest film, The Prestige, is an example of the second type of movie. The acting, costumes, and editing that worked so well to immerse the audience are all but wasted due to the film's disappointing conclusion.

Christian Bale (of Batman Begins fame) plays Alfred Borden, a magician who at the start of the film is on trial for the murder of fellow magician, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Borden is convicted and sent to jail to await his execution. While in jail he is given Angier's diary to read which chronicles Angier's rivalry with Borden, and his obsessive attempts to recreate Angier's ""disappearing man"" trick.

The first element that comes into play is the editing. Nolan chooses to tell his story non-linearly, starting en media res and skipping from various points in time in each of the character's lives. In so doing he is able to take relatively simple subject matter (the rivalry between the two men) and maximizes its effect. Each scene is edited in such a way that it reveals something new about the character, that if done otherwise would not be as evident. Nolan also manipulates our emotions by constantly showing the darker sides of the two main characters in such a way that we don't know who we should sympathize with.

Of course without the wonderful performances all around, the editing would be rendered moot. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play their roles pitch perfectly. How interesting it is to see both of these actors fresh off two comic book movies (Batman Begins for Bale, and the X-men trilogy for Jackman) both able to adjust themselves to more serious roles. Jackman's obsessiveness is always believable, never forced. Likewise, Bale' portrayal of the arrogant and selfish Borden is totally convincing. Bale, who is Welsh, once again proves that he is a master of accents, moving so easily from the American accent showcased in Batman Begins to a British accent here in The Prestige. Of special consideration is David Bowie in the role of Nikola Tesla. His character is called in near the end to help Angier finally create a better magic trick than Borden's ""disappearing man"" trick. Bowie owns the role, demanding out attention, being both sympathetic and cocky at the same time.

Finally, the costumes and set designs all work to immerse us in the story. The movie was shot on real locations, and it shows. The costumes look entirely period, and before we are even told that the movie takes place in 1887, we know right by looking at the characters. If the movie doesn't get nominated for academy awards in these areas it would be a real shame.

The sum of all these parts help to create the illusion of reality, or rather, credibility in the story. Here in lies the major problem with the film. The ending revolves around the murder of Angier, and how it relates to the machine used in the ""New Disappearing Man Trick."" While I cannot reveal the secret, all I can say is that it is terribly disappointing. It stretches credibility too far, as if the writers had finally come to the ending without realizing that they needed to write it. It also works to discredit the characters as true magicians and inventive thinkers.

In the end there is a lot to like about The Prestige. It is wonderful in both its simplicity of story and complexity of themes. It is a wonder to look at, and much can be gained from a second viewing. All you need to do is be prepared to really suspend disbelief.

22 September 2015,Christopher Nolan does a good job!,"THE PRESTIGE is one of Christopher Nolan's most underrated films. When people think of his movies, they always think of movies such as Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises (both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises has been reviewed on IMDb).

I might not like the story of the film, but I love the direction of Christopher Nolan and this movie is awesometacular in every way. First off, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johannson, David Bowie and Michael Caine all did really great jobs in this film and I could have not been more pleased.

The music, cinematography and visual style are also gorgeous and the direction is perfect. The movie is also the prime example of keeping you in your seat in theaters or watching this on DVD or TV, it is a true blessing.

Overall, I don't like the story of this movie, but I can still watch THE PRESTIGE and this movie is close to being a smash hit. So, I will give this film an 8 out of 10.",10
10 March 2008,misdirection at it's finest,"The 2000's has not been a great movie decade. This movie will be one of the 10 best unless 09 really shines. Not a dull moment, not a line ignored, strong performances from a great cast, and in the final moment, you realize you were missing the obvious for the whole movie. The music set the mood for every light and dark moment, the lighting was superb, as mentioned on the disk, a lot of earth colors that make the moments seem calm, but still surrealistic.

And finally the photography, made the magic seem even more real. You will not find many movies of this decade that were better, come to think of it, you will not find a lot of movies ever that will top this excellent film.

20 November 2012,Brainmelting,"We learn within the first minute just what ""the prestige"" is. It would turn out to be what the film is really all about, its third act. The prestige of The Prestige is twist after twist after reveal until an ULTIMATE climax, but after the second big twist your brain will be mush. The film closes with a line about ""being fooled"" and I was certainly fooled. There are many questions that are answered, and further more questions that can have answers- but pursuing them would be pointless. The writing is incredible as far as the plot is concerned: the 'first, next, then' is well managed, but the ""why"" at the end has lots of ambiguity. Some won't like the lack of denouement, but it's almost certainly an artistic choice and thus subjective.

The plot is not linear- if you read the back of the Blu Ray or IMDb description, you will be bewildered by the first 20 minutes. Keep an open mind and just absorb the scenes in the film- there is great reward.

Artistically amazing, the turn of the 20th century is a unique time period hardly explored by genres of than the historical drama or biopic, both typically ""boring"" if well made films. The costumes, lighting and atmosphere are moody, like the film content. And it's really weird to hear Christian Bale's regular voice.

There are issues however: the opening scenes are jarring, and it's always tough to tell when and how much time has jumped between scenes. Considering the high level of Nolan's films, especially their beginnings, this confusion put a damper on the whole film. Also, the initial friendship between Angier and Borden is hardly shown, and poorly sold.

The themes of obsession and rivalry dominate the film: what would you do to get ahead of your opponent? Would it have a permanent effect on you? Both magicians cut moral corners, leading to another interesting idea: who's the good guy? Bad guy? Even by the end it can be tough to decide, if you choose to decide.

The Prestige is an excellent film that boggles the mind, but I feel it too loose to be considered a Nolan masterpiece. Its plot, characters and acting are incredible, conveying a very topical feeling of magic. Nevertheless a worthy view, if you can tolerate small cracks throughout and chips off at the end. 8.5/10",9

26 December 2008,The PERFECT Nolan movie !!!,"I am a Nolan fan, i am looking forward to his new movies. I think Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight are the best movies I have ever seen. This man knows how to create a masterpiece! He has specific characteristics, like Burton and Shyamalan. You like their movies or not, generally you can tell ""This is a .... movie!"" as soon as you see a movie of them.

In my opinion, some directors want to reveal themselves, their characteristics in a movie. I think Shyamalan's Lady in The Water and Nolan's Prestige are such movies. I see Nolan as a magician. You can see all the pledge, the turn and the prestige in all of his movies. The best part of his movies is that you cannot see the trick easily. You can watch the movie again and again, and you may still see new points. You may still change your mind about the truth, about ""the trick"" or you may just be lost in surrealism, in a multi-dimensional truth. You may just see what you want to see and you can never get what was Nolan brothers thinking, just like a poem.",10
15 November 2010,The Prestige-Illusions of Mystery Betrayal Thriller,"This is a well crafted movie of a thriller mystery genre.

To start with the movie has got all good casting.

It brings in the flavor of magic in the movie by a perfect art direction and costumes of the cast especially.

The place shown which are setting reflects the period of the story which gave the movie a nice ambiance.

The magician's roles were well crafted by the director.

Also best acting from both the lead magician's of the movie.

The movie goes around with illusions and there are so many twists and betrayal in the plot which makes the movie interesting.

Not much role for Rebbeca hall she comes and goes here and there in the story.

Scarlet's role as portrayed well.

The drawback was the overall length of the movie

Watch out for a different thriller, mystery, betrayal.

I would give 7.5 on 10.",8
2 December 2006,The prestige,"The name of the movie. It says it all. Its a classic movie. Its pure class. I was spellbound by the flawless direction. The screenplay is perfect. The music, the background, the story. It was all so well knit together. Kudos to the director. I was not a big fan of either Christan bale or Hugh Jakcman..But, that has changed. These two go about their business like they are thorough professionals. I wish the movie had done better. Its a strongly recommended movie for anyone. WOW..WHAT A MOVIE!! I just had to say it again..one of my ALL TIME FAVS. I did go to see it with no expectation. I was contemplating watching another movie since I had not heard enough about this one. But, I am glad my friends came up with the idea to see this one. I paid 10 bucks to see it since it was an upperclass theater. But, I am not complaining at all. Would have paid a lot more to see it..GO watch it before any other movie..

19 November 2006,Truly the best film I have ever seen,"I really hope The Prestige features heavily at the Oscars this year as it deserves to. It was an absolutely wonderful film that had everything.

My very favourite thing about this film was that every little quirk was explained, but subtly, and that despite all the twists and denouements, it remained utterly conceivable and not in the least bit cheesy. The acting was superb throughout, and we were brought back to what was a truly exciting part of English history.

Having re-watched the trailer, it is obvious that this would be an ideal film to watch twice as almost every line refers directly and cleverly to something that is revealed later on in the film. Watch it twice, you will see what I mean!

16 April 2007,the prestige has no prestige,"A film that you know the end from the beginning must be a very good film to catch the attention of the audience, like a good trick of magic or like good films like ""memento"" or ""usual suspects"". If we know the end at least we expect some interesting history, a real plot, good characters, not just a pretentious film. Here we only have two magicians going all the way around each other, with an obvious twist that evolves into a sci-fi twist which nobody wants to see because we already know. I'd say that the acting of the three main characters is very good (Bale is superb as always, and Jackman is improving), s. Johanson is also OK but her character could be off the film and nobody would notice.

26 December 2006,The amazing world of magic and wizardry.,"Before watching this movie, I've already known Christopher Nolan from his several previous works such as Memento, Insomnia and Batman Begins. His talent as a director is a gift given not to so many, and that gift made the movie ""Prestige"" a masterpiece. The movie grips you to your seat and takes you to a world of magic and wizardry. While watching the movie, you find yourself in the middle of the war of pride and honor between two rival illusionists. They push their limits in creativity to be better than the other. All the illusions or tricks shown in the stage are amazing, and that is Christopher Nolan who gives each of them the thrill that increases your adrenaline.

About the actors, Hugh Jackman is again great like he has been in many of his former movies. In the movie, after the loss of his wife, his ambitious struggle against the once fellow friend Alfred Borden (Christopher Nolan) impresses everyone. Christopher Nolan, plays the fanatic character who dedicated himself to illusions and tricks very well. Apart from these two, Michael Cane and David Bowie play the most colorful two characters. Especially, David Bowie gives life to the most debated scientist ever, Tesla.

The only thing that a person should do while watching this movie, is to be patient and tolerant in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The first 15 minutes is quite confusing and one can become dizzy while following who is who. But then the movie will grab you tightly and will never let you out even many hours after it ends.",10

10 September 2022,6.9/10 - Nolan as a Magician,"""-You are pretending.

-I don't think changing a name compares.

-Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.""

The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan, follows two magicians - Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) - as a toxic rivalry between them leads to more and more extreme consequences. It deals with the price one pays in order to make great art, the things that define who we are and of course, deception and misdirection, used by the two magician as well as by Nolan on the audience. Typical Nolan, I'd say.

My expectations for this one were pretty high, and I think that quite understandably so. After all, Memento is one of my all-time favorite films and The Prestige is often considered by Nolan fans on par with Memento. I'd even say that The Prestige is the more popular of the two. Sadly, though I do appreciate this film, my expectations weren't met.

I like many things about The Prestige. It explores interesting themes in unique ways, it has memorable twists that give us a lot of things to pick on in our second viewing, tons and tons of foreshadowing moments that were probably missed by the viewers the first time watching it. It has layers upon layers of analogies between magic tricks and filmmaking. I also like how the film is built like what it deals with - a magic trick. In a way, though, this is the film's downfall.

You see, on paper this movie should've been great. It should've been...well, magical. But it lacks charm, quite ironically. It's mechanical, stiff, forced even. The Prestige feels like a lot of moments that were stitched together haphazardly, though I know it absolutely has meaning and context behind its structure. The film has much thought behind it. It's not about what it has once you deconstruct it, though. It's about the feeling it gave me, and to me it felt like the flow of the film as a story was very lacking. I just couldn't be totally immersed.

You know, Christopher Nolan being the director of this film is especially fascinating to me. It says a lot about how he sees filmmaking, and as someone who watched some films of his I know how he likes grand reveals, the twists, the moments that make people gasp in shock. To him, a film is much like a magic trick indeed. That's what Nolan is looking for in cinema, at least in a way he is. I do find that admirable, but I also think that building your entire movie on twists upon twists, stitching together ideas and unreliable threads of plot to, well, fool you - and, of course, often to tell us something about ourselves, something about the world, dressing a truth up as a story - has its problems.

So, what is the thing that makes The Prestige feel so mechanical to me? I think that it's probably the thought process behind the film. With his eyes on the prize (the ""prestige"" of this movie), Nolan created a film that explores fascinating ideas and fools much of the viewers without making it flow well, be immersive or actually have me emotionally engaged all the way through. The way it jumps from moment to moment, one perspective to another and all in purpose of fooling us in the end - well, I think it might have made me a bit disconnected.

Do I like this film? It's hard to say that I do. Do I appreciate what it's trying to do and the way Nolan chose to create it? Absolutely. But though this film has many interesting themes it explores, solid cinematography, memorable twists and layers of analogies, it lacks so much in its flow and immersiveness. I might have been fooled, but the magic trick as a whole doesn't feel as real as I'd like it to be. I'm feeling a 6.9/10 on this one.",6

11 September 2012,"incredible, should be watched more than once","Watching a movie ten times is stupid. Unless, of course, that movie is The Prestige. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind.",10

3 November 2006,Not your typical illusion show.,"The Prestige/2006/***

Main Stars: Michael Caine Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Scarlett Johansson Rebecca Hall

Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is brilliantly unexpected! When I saw previews for the film, I knew the movie was about intense, intriguing illusions. Illusions so intense that the one performing it might die right in front of the audience or make YOU walk out of the theater. But I can take intense scenes in movies. This one was one of the most intense films I've seen this year! I could hear and feel my heart wanting to escape my chest. Actually, at the end of the film I think my eardrum was damaged. The film was that loud at least during one of the many illusions. One that had the biggest mystery. One that was supposed to have more than just a) the pledge (taking something ordinary and showing it to everyone) and b) the turn (that one ordinary thing becomes something extraordinary). It had to have the most important something. Something that's not just important, but is very difficult to perform. That's c) THE PRESTIGE. That one illusion actually resulted in the climax and resolution of the story so why should I tell YOU? You would kinda predict the climax though after seeing the illusion. At least I did. But everyone's different. The story takes place in London, England. It takes place in the bad parts of London. You might not notice that from the previews. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are competing magicians who both seem to have a lot of talent in magic. You would think that this competition is peaceful. Well change your thoughts now because it's not. Robert and Alfred are both vengeful people and are both hungry for audience attention. So they both compete and compete with each other. They both hate each other, might I add. They were friends before that until they became hungry for more power over the other. Friendship that became a rivalryRivalry that became a battle. This is an excellent and very true tagline for the film, which brought me to the prediction that this film will be pretty intense, and that's the reason why I didn't run out of the theater after seeing some intense scenes. What is even worse about the competition between these two maniacs and their hunger for attention and power and better magic is that it's interfering with their family. Robert and Alfred both start out with wives and Alfred ends up with a kid. Robert does not. But does Alfred really love his wife (Rebecca Hall) or does he love Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), a woman who works for show and as eye candy in both Robert's and Alfred's department? Maybe he likes neither; maybe he likes both. Usually movies answer your questions. You have that question? See the movie. Then there's Robert who's more of a mystery than Alfred is because he seems to have more on his mind and can't get it out clearly. But you'll find out what his plan is. In my opinion, Alfred is worse than Robert. To not be so blunt, I'll specify it a little more. He's worse in the way of how violent he is and what he does is terrible, and I think he caused Robert to be that way. He influenced him to be as violent as he is. Plus, he may have been influenced by his manager Cutter (Michael Caine) who really pressured him and wanted the best of the best out of him. And to think this movie is supposed to be about magic and friendly competition and the magicians reading each others diaries and tricking each other with odd codes and twists and turns that might take years to decode. The decoding of diaries was actually in the movie. But it's not that way in this film. The Prestige has more than just a stupid illusion show; it has a good illusion show and it has a good background story. It shows how messed up some people get when they want attention and that turns into a plausible, intense thriller! Movie directed by Christopher Nolan.",8

It took to me about 5 hours to finished it, i reversed it many times to try to understand. It deserve an Oscar, there's no more, I LOVE ""THE PRESTIGE"". It is very helpful to get comments of many people who likes movies, I watched it around 3 weeks ago and i have not finished to understand all points, there is a lot of magic. After I red several comments i will watch again, I really want to watch again, maybe this time i will be able to discover all secrets. Thanks to Nolan's for this movie, it makes feel that ""good movies"" does not finish yet.I am from Mexico, regards

19 October 2006,Another Magical Work by Nolan.,"After watching 3 of Christopher Nolan's shows, I really have a high expectation of this movie. In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.

""The Prestige"" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's ""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"", though they are effective for their respective movies.

I watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.

Hugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.

Like other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.

Despite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar. The genre doesn't really suit well with Oscar type of movies.

Nevertheless, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best movies this year, and is definitely a must watch.",8
26 October 2008,A wonderful magician... but a dreadful showman,"According to Micheal Caine's grizzled Cockney showman Cutter, every great magic trick consists of three parts.

The first is the pledge - our magician shows us something ordinary. In the opening minutes of The Prestige Nolan fans will certainly feel on safe territory. The nonlinear narrative jerks us, under the familiar tones of Micheal Caine (currently Nolan's go-to man for Wise Old Associates), into the world of late-Victorian showmen - a world of canary cages and dusty warehouses, red curtains and blinding spotlights.

Nolan's familiar themes of all-encompassing obsession (tackled brilliantly in his Batman films and the earlier Memento) are instantly addressed in the characters of Alfred Borden and Robert Angier, two magicians locked into a battle of wits over the accidental death of Angier's wife - of which he holds Borden responsible. Like a latter-day Hitchcock, Nolan has carved out a style of thriller all of his own - the washed-out orange filters, the noir-y smoky streets, Christian Bale, Micheal Caine. Strip back the super-hero elements and you've almost got a Victorian Batman Begins - except with two Batman's who prefer to use their brains over their fists.

The second part of any great trick is the turn - in which our magician takes the ordinary something, and makes it do something extraordinary. It's from this comfortable position that The Prestige's increasingly convoluted and at times outright nasty plot can unfold - as the rivalry increases, consuming their entire lives, Angier finds himself drawn deeper into something close to true magic - and like all true magic, your disbelief - the 'look on their faces,' the source of Angier's obsession - becomes paramount, as Nolan is giving full reign to introduce the truly fantastical.

Like Hitchcock the plot is everything - all the characters and backdrops are for the most part - like Scarlet Johanson's assistant - set dressing. In The Prestige everything hinges upon the twist. Nolan is perhaps the finest thriller director working in Hollywood today, yet the true human focus of his films is often subservient to the narrative - and The Prestige is no different.

Borden's relationship with his wife seems unnecessarily forced (despite Bale's decent performance) and a little devoid of chemistry, as is Angier's with his assistant (Johanson) - yet this matters little, as the human element is there only to make the shocks more potent. As Cutter says, a lovely assistant is often one of the best forms of misdirection, and as The Prestige's narrative unfolds this soon becomes apparent in the film itself. The exception is David Bowie's surprisingly poignant turn as long-suffering failed genius Nikola Tesla, and the ever-reliable Micheal Caine.

Finally at the end of any good trick, a magician brings back the object, the final deception - The Prestige. And as seems to be the case with all thrillers post-Usual Suspects, the twists in The Prestige's final reveal will completely change your viewing experience a second-time around.

So... is the trick a success? Perhaps Angier's words sum up Christopher Nolan best - 'A wonderful magician, but a dreadful showman.' The narrative itself, the film's core, is perfect - in fact its twists and turns, its self-referencing, its playfulness elevate it above almost any other thriller released since.

Yet where Nolan falls down is the presentation. Cinematography ranges from competent to good, but you don't get any Kubrick-style flashes of genius. Other than the two characters driving the plot, there's not a lot of human emotion to the proceedings - you never find yourself particularly caring for many of the side-characters, even when terrible things befall them (and without meaning to give too much away, terrible things DO befall a few of them). I've already compared Nolan to Hitchcock - a little hyperbolic, maybe, but he's the closest thing we have these days to the master - and he shares his faults, too.

And yet for all that, The Prestige is a trick not to be missed, a rare enigmatic gem of a film that fails to give up all its secrets even at the end. A must-see for thriller fans, and an awe-inspiring treat for everyone else - and unlike the tricks it portrays, definitely worth seeing twice.",9
14 November 2019,A love letter to filmmaking,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

26 March 2023,Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is a mind-bending masterpiece that will leave you spellbound,"""The Prestige (2006)"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves audiences in awe with its mind-bending plot, stunning visuals, and outstanding performances. Christopher Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, as he expertly weaves a complex and intricate story that keeps viewers engaged and guessing until the very end.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give incredible performances as rival magicians who become consumed by their competition, and their chemistry on screen is palpable. Michael Caine also shines as their mentor, providing a sense of wisdom and perspective amidst the chaos.

The film's visuals are simply breathtaking, with stunning cinematography and visual effects that transport viewers into the world of magic and illusion. The score by Hans Zimmer is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the film's dark and mysterious tone.

Overall, ""The Prestige"" is a masterclass in filmmaking that showcases Nolan's unparalleled skill as a storyteller. It's a must-see for anyone who loves movies, magic, or just a good mystery.",10
15 October 2022,Absolute mess!!,"Absolute mess!! Cumbersome, muddled... plot all over the place. It doesn't even know what it wants to be.

(Only reason Dark Knight was a success was because of The Joker...)

It doesn't know if it wants to be an ode to Tesla or just a movie about magic... or what?

I LOVED The Illuionists and Prestige won't hold candle to it.. I seriously cannot possibly fathom how the mass and populace gave it 8.5. Seriously? Whereas Illusionist was minimal, artistic.. this is just another generic Hollywood blockbuster, a borefest drivel that people ate up thinking 'since everyone likes it thus it must be good duh'.

30 October 2006,Absolutely wonderful movie,"When I first went into the theater, it was to see ""Employee of the Month,"" however I am really glad I chose to see ""The Prestige"" instead. This movie can be a little confusing at times, but it makes a lot of sense at the very end. It includes several plot twists and is a thought- compelling movie. My friend and I discussed ""The Prestige"" for at least a half hour. The plot is very good. The only flaw with this movie was that it could become confusing because of the time shifts. The time-jumps were needed in order to inform the viewer of the entire story, but it can leave a few people feeling confused. I don't really wanna expose the ending, which is why I'm not writing much about the plot. The actors' performances were great, and they included a lot of passion in their work. I would definitely say that if you've got money to go see a movie, ""The Prestige"" should be on your list, if not #1.

21 October 2006,Amazing Film...A Warning Though!,"This film was a typical Chris Nolan, uniquely compelling story and with great actors. Bale really turns in a great performance along with others of course. The twists and turns keep you very intrigued through out the movie. The magic tricks are entertaining and the story is fantastic. You become wrapped up in the rivalry to the point of not caring who really wins in the end, but just really, really wanting to know what happens next because you end up liking both characters.

A warning! Do not think about figuring out the movie. If you start wondering to much about the secrets of this movie...you may very well figure it out, and thats not a good thing. You want to be entertained and shocked..right? I thought way to much when watching the movie that I figured out the ending and final secrets. I am still mad at myself, but still equally loved this movie. So don't make my same mistake. Especially if you've seen Nolan's movies before.

4 May 2007,Wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere (Possible spoilers),"Cristopher Nolan does it again! He is definitely someone to watch in the future. In THE PRESTIGE he creates a wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere, thanks to excellent use of music and superb cinematography and set design. There is hardly any day exteriors at all. The approach of scrambling the continuity works fine here and makes you pay extra attention, soon it will become such an often used device that audiences probably wont even notice. The acting is overall uniformly excellent, Michael Caine stands out as a center of gravity for the plot and the rest of the ensemble. Even David Bowie has improved his acting with age, and now also has great authority and weight, he hardly registers as ""Bowie"" at all. What you will make of the payoff is probably very individual, I thought it fitted the slightly surreal and dreamlike ambiance the rest of the movie had. The cinematography, as I mentioned, is stunning. It must have been an ordeal for the focus puller, since it is anamorphic, mostly hand-held, and often shot in under-lit locations.

3 July 2014,The Mesmerising Mr. Nolan Works His Magic,"The Prestige is another masterful directorial outing for Christopher Nolan who has not put a foot wrong yet. The film is sandwiched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and serves to once again highlight the wonderful diversity of his work. That he was overlooked for a directorial Oscar nomination for 'Inception' is to the eternal shame of the Academy. The rivalry between Jackman and Bale's characters is loaded with intrigue at every mesmerising twist and turn, and they are supported by a superb cast of characters each presented with an engaging part that the audience cannot fail to invest in. But it is the story that is the true star, brought to life by Nolan, but beautifully imagined by author Christopher Priest. The tricks are all explained but will enthral you nonetheless, as will this excellent film.

17 April 2022,Mind blowing is simply not enough to describe it,"My greatest regret in life is not being able to watch this movie for the first time, multiple times. I wish I could forget it over and over agin, so that I can be bewildered each time as I was the first. That's how great Nolan's mind mastery is.

Unfortunately, forgetting it is not possible.

So, just make sure to enjoy the magic trick properly, the first time you watch it, because once you find out the secret, you will never be able to do it in the same way again:))

21 October 2006,All expectations met,"When I discovered that many of the people involved in the making of this movie, both in front and behind the camera, were also involved in the making of one of my other favorites, ""Batman Begins,"" my expectations for this movie went immediately up, and I must say that I was not disappointed. The writing was excellent, the lines delivered perfectly, and the plot was so original, with so many twists, that it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. The casting couldn't have been better.

I think it was a bit confusing at first, as there are so many switches between flashbacks and present day that it sometimes becomes hard to keep up, but it's essentially all sorted out by the time you've really gotten into it. All the same, I cannot wait to see it a second time, when I'll undoubtedly get even more out of the plot than the first time through. Some people also claimed that they had the whole plot figured out from the very beginning, and I guess I feel rather sorry for them, though I myself was kept guessing throughout the whole thing. On the other hand, I believe that there will be many who do not like ""The Prestige"" because it actually requires you to think. (*gasp*) This movie has the same, dark flavor as ""Batman Begins,"" though with slightly less action, and is one of my new favorite movies. I anxiously await watching it a second time, and reading the book.

On a final note, do not listen to those who say that this movie was terrible because of the numerous ""plot holes."" Anyone who completely understands each aspect of the plot will see plainly that such holes do not exist, and that those who say otherwise are under a false impression, confused, or just missed something. If you can follow along, there is nothing seriously wrong with this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone.",10
28 April 2015,Tremendous story telling. Wondrous film.,"I knew nothing of this before seeing it and it was such a surprise. I loved it. Not like a modern day film, just a wonderful story. Cast well, acted well. But it is the complex story, the wonder of the magic and the wonderfully flawed and tragic characters carry this film to such heights. The complexity of their mistake riddled and shared history defines their relationships and their lives and is so well imagined and so well told on screen. I love Michael Caine's role and his applied example of the Ockham's Razor priniple. I've since read criticisms that relate to the depiction of Tesla and of Nolan as a director. Such criticisms have nothing to do with the entertainment value of this film in its own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will watch it again. It is a new favourite. If you have not yet seen this, avoid reviews beforehand and enjoy the surprises throughout.

30 October 2006,"An interesting movie, but really not that surprising","After seeing the movie, I was surprised by the number of 8, 9, and 10 stars that people gave it, saying things like it was ""the best movie of the year"". I must disagree. This is a movie worth watching for entertainment's sake, since individual aspects of the movie are top notch, but overall I would leave movie of the year to something like The Departed instead.

Pro's:

1) Very good acting

2) Unique plot

3) Nice effects, especially when you see how magic ""really"" gets done

4) Believable characters -you definitely empathize with both main characters, despite their treachery

5) Extremely tight plot. It brings to mind the Harry Potter books, actually - every little detail is important and plays a role. Things that you are think are periphery turn out to lead you to the conclusion. Good foreshadowing

Con's:

1) So, so so predictable. I was shocked that people were surprised by the ending

2) Inconsistent idea. This movie tried to be about two things. It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old ""is there magic"" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing.

3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.

4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)

All in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra ""oomph"" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it.",6
7 October 2017,Prestige Show,"Christopher Nolan brings yet another a mysterious movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well.

At Borden's murder trial, Angier's engineer John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.

This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. The rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him a great deal of money and Cutter's friendship while providing him with a collection of his own suicide victims; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth.

True to Nolan's style, at 130 minutes, this film is lengthy. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit drawn out, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline was a bit unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen.

The Prestige is sacrificing, non-humorous, and dark—and well worth a part of your time.",9

24 October 2006,Good but not good enough,"The production is wonderful and the acting very good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do great work here, and Michael Caine is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson is good, too, but she is underused in this male-dominant film. There is a lot of twists and turns, but the problem is, they also give away a lot of clues, right from the beginning shots, so if you have paid attention (and who wouldn't, once you enter the theater knowing you're about to see a mystery/thriller about magic), halfway through you would know how the story is going to end and what is happening. That's the problem with the film. With every great magic trick, you can't tell how it's done even if you look very closely. It's not the case with this film -- it's predictable once you figure it out, and it's not difficult.

It's not to say it's not enjoyable. The crosscutting, non-linear time lines can be confusing at first, but the director is smart enough to leave you visual clues so once you find your marks, the technique is interesting, keeping the twists close to the vest for the audiences. But once again, they leave you enough clues that if you have paid attention, you will figure it out. David Bowie is fun to watch, though -- I didn't even recognize it was him (although I recognize Mr. Gollum). Another problem is that the film focuses on the rivalry and the oneupmanship, and it feels cold. Compared to the Illusionist, which I think is a superb romantic mystery, the story and ending of The Prestige are less than emotionally rewarding. It's like a nice magic trick -- it will leave you giddy, full of wonder and imagination, but ultimately empty emotionally.",7
27 July 2020,Is Christopher Nolan one of the best directors or what?,"Man, whatever movie this guy makes it's a masterpiece. It's crazy how good he is. What an excellent script. Hugh, Christian and Michael rocked this one. I wish I had seen this in theaters.

30 October 2006,Keeps you engaged and you'll want to see it again,"Christopher Nolan does it again. Like Batman begins the story is very well written and I did not want to leave my seat for any reason. The movie was well cast with two of the Batman Begins actors, it was a great choice of talent.

I truly enjoyed this movie. It does have a longer runtime than most movies, but I wasn't checking my watch to leave. I definitely want to see this movie again.

I found myself trying to pay such close attention to see how tricks were done and figure them out that I likely missed something. I'm sure there were small details that I did not notice. Like the previous reviewer there were some confusing things with how the seasons changed drastically. Watching the movie again may help me understand.

I won't speak to the story line as I really recommend you see for yourself and it was worth the $9.50 and I will pay it again.",9

23 October 2006,....hocus bogus................,"I found this movie to be ponderous with a bogus ending, deus ex machina. The redeeming grace is the acting by all which was very good. It was great to see David Bowie, as Tessla, in a film again. His trademark two different eye colors, unobscured by matching contact lenses, add to his character's dimension, and ""Smeegle"" is amusing as Tessla's assistant. The sets and settings were very good, but I'm a sucker for a well put together period piece. The construction of the tricks was interesting and I enjoyed the execution of them throughout the entire film. I don't understand how the viewer rating is so high on this one, it's very long I much preferred ""The Illusionist"", with it's superior pacing and plot line that was much easier to follow and a better payoff at the end.

3 January 2007,A Masterpiece,"In the beginning i was reluctant about this movie but the director drive my mind to the theatre because i'm a big fan of memento. I left the movie just like a zombie with a million concept ideas about the story. It's a Masterpiece with a solid acting and a wonderful and intelligent screenplay. Christopher Nolan was the great magician with the real prestige in the end of the movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale divide the master role of this game of ambition, Michael Cane the mentor of both. They will deceive us with mind tricks, they will fool our minds with illusions about the story.

If you love movies that splinters your mind don't loose this outstanding work of art.

18 December 2006,Absolutely Magic!,"I love magic tricks. It's the intrigue of how the magician did it, the risk of knowing it could kill the 'assistant' and just the whole feeling of knowing you'll see something amazing.

'The Prestige' is strikingly similar to a magic show that you'd see at the theatre. It starts off grasping your attention, and then quickly throws you into the action, where you see a performance gone wrong, which left me covering my mouth in shock.

If 'The Prestige' had been filmed with any other actors, I probably would have been disappointed (but only so slightly). Jackman, Bale and Caine are all stars we are fond of, and they have only boosted their reputation by giving stunning performances in this film. Johansson's acting was a little dull and uninspired, but her roll was, in the end, fairly small.

The storyline was at some times a bit confusing, and I found myself trying to work out what came when and who was who, but it all fell into place in the final half hour, along with a plethora of shocking twists that make the story better and better. I can't say how close it is to the book by Christopher Priest (I'm soon to read it), but from what I have heard, the films is highly respected by most fans of the novel.

I don't want to go into the story too much, because it would ruin the movie for anyone. It's a film to see when you're aware and observant, though, as it's quite easy for you to get confused and possibly spoil the movie.

I'm giving it 9/10, and it gets 'Film of the Year' from me, without a doubt!",9

22 November 2020,"""Are you watching closely?""","Although many people think that The Prestige is a great movie and one of Nolan's greatest films, I still think it is underrated and it deserves more than that. The film is unbelievable and one of the greatest films that I have ever seen, I will never forget it

The Prestige has an amazing cast, everyone did put on a great acting performance even those who were not the main character like Andy Serkis and David Bowie. Hugh Jackman's performance was incredible, this is for sure one of my favorite performances of him. Although Rebecca Hall is not the main character, most of the scenes that she was in were dramatic scenes and she killed it, her facial expressions and emotions were able to convince the audience, when actors make you feel that they are not acting that's when you know how incredible they are and that is how Rebecca Hall in this film. Finally, the great Christian Bale who for me is the one who stole the spotlight in this film, and the reason why I think that is because of a specific reason that unfortunately, I won't be able to mention so I don't spoil anything.

The film has such a great and unique story that is filled with plot twists. It talks about magic and tricks but the real thing is that the audience got tricked. I loved how Nolan treats this film and how he presented it to the audience, he makes us see what he wants us to see but the truth that there is something behind it exactly like a magic trick, the magician makes us see the magic trick but not the secret and that is what Nolan did, we saw the magic trick but we never saw the secret behind it until the very end of it.

In Addition, the film's cinematography was great, I was not surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar for ""Best Cinematography"", it has a few shots and frames that were visually stunning like the very first shot of the film where all the hats were on the floor. Also, the music score, production, and custom designs were all very great especially the production design.

The very first scene of the film was great, it grabs your attention and makes you wonder what is happening and why did that specific thing happen but then and until the first hour the film is boring and felt like there are scenes that are unnecessary. But after the first hour, everything started to go crazy and a lot of stuff started to be clear.

In the end, if you did not watch this film, I don't know what are you waiting for. ""Highly recommend"" it and this is for sure one of my favorite films ever.

My rating is 9/10",9
20 October 2006,Nolan Raises the Bar,"Christopher Nolan is incredible at creating suspense. This movie is all about secrets; secrets between friends, secrets between enemies, and secrets from the audience. As Nolan seems to like to do in his movies, he does a great job of keeping the audience out of the loop and always a step behind. When good directors make a few good movies, it's easy to slip along the way. Each new movie they make is another chance for them to fail, and people start to anticipate these failures because they hold each new film to a higher standard than the previous one. He hasn't disappointed me yet.

The acting is well done. I don't think anyone would expect a poor performance from Michael Cane, Christain Slater, or Scarlett Johanson, and they definitely didn't achieve anything less than expected. Hugh Jackman proves to be a talented actor in an artistic film, not just a high budget Hollywood production.

29 October 2006,"This movie has the pledge, the turn and the prestige","This is a movie about two rival illusionists, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who try to outdo each other's tricks and prove to be the better one. And while they are trying to learn the secrets of each others' tricks, they also sabotage each other's shows. One day, Alfred invents a trick that seems to deny the laws of physics (but after all, this is magic and all magic tricks seem to deny the laws of physics). Robert sets his mind to figuring out Alfred's trick and improving it so he can come out as the better magician. His journey to understanding Alfred's trick takes Robert to the US where he meets a scientist who seems to have found a way to manipulate electrical energy at a whole new level. He invests his money in a machine that can perform real magic (something all illusionists claim to do but only wizards can do).

The movie begins with Alfred being accused of murdering Robert (while Robert was performing his magic with that electrical machine) and sentenced to death penalty. Since they are known to have sabotaged each other's shows, people take this to be one of those incidents that just ended up deadly for Robert. As Alfred is in jail, he gets Robert's journal and begins reading it. From this moment on, the movie moves backward in time and we get to see how the feud between the two magicians initially began and the events leading up to the Robert's death. The movie doesn't follow a straight time line and can be a little confusing at times. With Alfred's reading Robert's journal in where Robert speaks of reading Alfred's notes, sometimes it is hard to know where we are at the story.

Overall, I think the Prestige is a pretty good movie and I must add that it owes much of its success to directing skills of Christopher Nolan. The way he tells the story piece by piece as he pulls them from different places and times can easily go wrong but he is very good at doing that. I also liked the unknown element in the movie. There were some simple explanations to the seemingly magical tricks and there were also some unknown, sci-fi elements.",10

2 October 2011,Illusion In The Service Of Great Story Telling,"The art of prestidigitation is an apt metaphor for the contrived artifice of cinema. Christopher Nolan, like the master magicians depicted here, is intent on capturing our attention & imagination with his very skillful cinematic sleight of hand. And then in his bid for recognition as the ultimate showman, he risks his entire production on our natural human inclination to WANT to be deceived. He nudges & prods us into accepting this - our complicity in this deception - and then proceeds to taunt us for it. He smugly shows us the props & tools of his nefarious trade, and still he gains our confidence. As he entrances us with his magical visions we hand over to him our faith - and our cash. That's Hollywood, folks.

This film is essentially a mystery thriller that is doubly confounding because we are continually being reminded that everything we are witnessing may well be an illusion. We are repeatedly put on notice that our perception of the film's reality is to be doubted, and therefor the reliability of the actions & identities can only be highly suspect. Yet we are compelled to persist in our assumptions, our suspicions, as Nolan is quite masterful at charming us deeper into his ploy. Just past the mid point of the film I became aware that I was being set up for an exceptionally confounding deception. And so I doubled my intense analysis & scrutiny of every action, of every character, of every word, intent on detecting a clue to the approaching ""twist."" I am not embarrassed to say that I did not figure it out. I was damn surprised by the very clever, very ingenious gimmick that is finally revealed. Only because the set up was so wonderfully watchable do I not resent this film's blatant manipulations. Just as you must respect, ultimately, anyone who fairly outsmarts you, I tip my hat to Christopher Nolan. And I am STILL not completely sure of what I witnessed.

Hugh Jackman is a true Hollywood star and plays Robert Angier, an ambitious magician who competes with an old counterpart, Alfred Borden, for the title of finest in the land. Jackman's mere presence illuminates the screen, and he easily handles his character's subtle shifts in mood and tone. Christian Bale as his professional and then personal arch enemy certainly had the more challenging, less attractive role but somehow manages to maintain our sympathy. Michael Cain as Cutter, their one time boss and mentor is, as always, wonderfully natural & convincing. David Bowie, who previously seemed to always be playing a slightly grander version of his already expansive self, is here surprisingly low key and centered. He role was a fun, recurring element. But the women are a little less remarkable in their portrayals, as Scarlet Johansson's reading is often muddled and unfocused. She is, however, absolutely stunning to watch, her voluptuous curves and magical face seemingly created expressly for the big screen. Rebecca Hall as Alfred's put upon but loving wife is quite compelling despite her somewhat underwritten, sometimes clichéd role.

As we are so emphatically informed at the outset of this fanciful con, the real trick, the real Prestige of a magical illusion is in bringing back the disappeared object or person. So, thus warned, I was eagerly anticipating the magical return of a vanished element. What or who should we expect to be returning is the persistent question that this film begs. And just as consistently, it foils and thwarts your every guess. The Prestige is remarkably effective at raising the bar on the challenge of openly conceding to us cinema's deviously dubious nature, while still dazzling us with its superior artistry.",9
30 December 2008,Slow pace compensated with great cinematography and a unique third act.,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

28 July 2015,A Mind-Bending Psychological Thriller!!,"The Prestige is just one of the many Nolan movies that prove that he is one of the true cinematic geniuses in the world. A period film that is based on the life of two magicians, The Prestige, has all the ingredients that are necessary to challenge the viewers perception on what is truly happening. It has a narrative that is non-linear which makes it hard to pin down and fully understand the plot.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as the two magicians who are obsessed with proving the world who the better magician is. Both of them give charismatic, spellbinding performances that illustrate the depth of their rivalry and unyielding desire to perfect their craft.

Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors in the world and the entire movie has his stamp of authority and he is in control of every aspect of the film. Even after a couple of viewings, it is difficult to fully understand the complicated plot.

One aspect of the film that just does not live up to the standard is the music. It never manages to reach the heights that the cinematography had scaled. Apart from this, I would say that the only limitation that Nolan has is constructing strong female characters with substantial roles. In this movie as well, there is not much scope for the actresses to do something unique with their roles.

However, if you are looking for a smartly made movie that constantly challenges the viewer and demands repeat viewing, then The Prestige will fulfill your needs.",9
12 October 2010,"Strange, good, mysterious and very imposing.......","Although initially confusing and mysterious once you think about it (and maybe do some wider research of the plot) then you start to piece together the narrative of the film and you realise what Christopher Nolan wanted to portray with the very imposing last shot. The character development is brilliant as you don't know which side to be on as they are both flawed in their own way. A very complex but clever and unique narrative which is to be appreciated once you fully get it. Great cinematography and art direction, very imposing as your mind still keeps unravelling what you have just seen but you still love it. Amazing performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan is no doubt a very artistic and creative director. Worth the watch

2 May 2019,Why I gave it a 10.,"First of all I am kinda bias because I am a magician, but it is also because it shows the struggles magicians go through. Keep in mind they are overdoing the struggles, but having to do what they did are real things that happen sometimes as a magician. I really enjoyed it and anybody who likes magic should really watch it just do not try any of the tricks.

26 July 2014,New and Unique Movie,"Amazing movie ever seen on Magic, absolutely perfect making, though the plot based with the theme such as grudge, revenge, obsession etc, the way it is portrayed is totally awesome.

This movie could be called as something like ""Batman Vs X-men"", yeah Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play a role of a typical magic professional rivals, who always search for the good time to pull each other down, the only strategy that both use to do so, is find something best than other, both strive a lot to come up with some much more innovative magic tricks than their respective opponents, both sabotaging the tricks of each other trying to gain the recognition along with to fulfill their grudge, both come up with teleportation trick and each other try to depict themselves as the real 'Transported Man', the more they get competitive the more the things begin to get nasty, the story gets curious when Angier come up with some new magical innovation with the help of Nikola Tesla, he finds the way to form his own multiple duplication which is required for his magic tricks and he steadily gains the popularity as 'The Great Danton', but once when Angier was performing his popular trick Borden get down to find out an actual secret behind his mysterious magic, but surprisingly Borden is accused of Angier's death and is subjected to the death sentence, at last in the climax how Borden escapes the death and how Angier pay for his brilliant cheat full illusion forms the rest of the story.

The way the story has been presented is totally fine, screenplay plays the prominent part of this movie, performance by those superheroes are great, splendid direction by Christopher Nolan, the mention of the characters such as Thomas Edison & Nikola Tesla makes to seem like a satire of their respective true life conflicts, overall it's a unique try and a perfect making.",7
6 May 2020,Prestige,"Acting, camera shots, script, scene transitions, small nuances all very successful. I was also pleased by the fact that he touched Tesla lightly while processing the film script. However, despite the mention of Edison in the film, it was a bit of a lack of himself.

There are so many scenes in the movie that are intriguing, you cannot separate yourself from the screen while watching the movie. You will be astonished. With curious eyes, you will try to understand the mysteries in the movie. It's a movie that thinks about people. It is a movie that you have to train your mind while watching. Get ready for brainstorming.

In the movie, you will see what a person will do for their ambitions. He talks about a lot of greed going to be a feeling that blinds one's eyes. He also touches on how much a person can become blind because of his jealousy.

20 January 2007,Beyond good and evil,"Nolan's last haunting masterpiece is an impressive allegory about ambition, sacrifice, arrogance, obsession, titanic effort to go beyond natural limits and to challenge God. Nietzsche ""Ubermensch"" concept is embodied in the fight between these two Victorian-Age magicians, as well as the conflict between science and wizardry, instinct and rationality, respect of the rules and compulsive intention to go beyond good and evil. When you go out of the cinema, you think about the inner sense of this movie again, and again, and again... Great emotions, great plot (a sort of Greek tragedy!), great meta-reflection about perception, theories of mind, and psychological blindness: a great movie. Abracadabra!

19 November 2006,Two rival magicians escalate the already fierce competition between them.,"The plot of was totally enthralling and kept one guessing from beginning to end. The film beautifully captured much of the ambiance of the late Victorian era. At times, the cinematography was incredibly breathtaking, but more importantly, the entire spirit of how tough and cutthroat the competition must have really been for magicians trying to make a name for themselves in those days was readily evident. The characters were superbly acted by all concerned because they were quite believable. In particular, I thought Michael Caine was outstanding as Cutter and I was additionally happy to see David Bowie portray Nikola Tesla.

I also enjoyed the fact there was a truly 'surprise element' to it which might prompt people to think about what transpired within the movie on a deeper level. It is very refreshing to see a movie come along that's original in many aspects. The movie was well written and directed, to say the least.

I love movies which I can come away with with a sense of something significant having happened which causes me to reflect. This movie definitely fits the bill.",10
18 January 2014,Good Movie from Christopher Nolan,"As I expected from Christopher Nolan's movies, The Prestige is a good one. It is about the story of two obsessed magicians that compete to become a true ""great magician"". The acting of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who become the main characters for this movie is quite good. But I think Michael Caine is the true masterpiece, his acting is really good and he becomes the ""Nolan'secret"" in this movie.And of course, Christopher Nolan can make this movie's ending unpredictable. I give 8 for this movie because of the plot and the acting of the actor/actress are good and the situation is like Dark Knight, dark situation. I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies so I think this is one of the must watch movies.

6 June 2007,Disappointment,"Maybe it has to do with the fact that I didn't like much Memento or Batman begins ( following was quite nice though) but seeing the name Christopher Nolan made me doubt to watch the movie. But of course , as a die hard film fan, I did and again I was left unsatisfied. Positive : actors : Hugh Jackman / Christian Bale, inside look in some (the ""gruesome"" birdcage)magic tricks

Negative :

long dreaded, not particularly amusing, not much character deepening, story.

Overall : At a certain moment i just wanted the movie to end. And I don't have that often. Probably you have to be a Nolan fan. If you are not don't bother watching this film

The compelling story full of twist will keep your eyes open the whole time, truly magical, ++A performances by everyone. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were amazing, the deception each character brings is so compelling and you will soon find yourself obsessed with the film. The dynamic framework and Victorian setting pull you in from the real world and take you on thrilling experience. Acting as it was meant to be, you will feel the dramatics as if you were at a theatre play and experience the great affects of film. A haunting dark force surrounds many parts and after you leave the theater the film will stay with you. Don't blink.

It left me with curiosity every minute of the movie. Contrary to other movies, the twists and turns cannot be anticipated. This is truly worth the eight dollar student ticket, and it would not leave you with regrets. This movie is a must! I am no critic, but this movie would be ""two thumbs way up."" In comparison to his other wonderful movies, Batman Beins and Momento, i would say this is the best. And i must admit Batman Begins was one outstanding movie. The acting in the movie reflects the ""old"" times. The plot was well written and nothing was flawed. If you plan to watch a movie, i would recommend this one.

13 February 2007,"Very well acted, one of the best films done for a while","I had seen the trailer for this film but didn't know what to think of it. I put off watching it several times, but when i eventually did watch it.... WOW!!!! What a fantastic film it turned out to be. Michael Caine is great, as are the two leading male roles. Plus the added bonus of the gorgeous Scarlett Johannson, she is just simply stunning. She'd look good in whatever you dressed her in, plus she can act too. The twists and turns in this film are great, they keep you hooked right till the end, and what an ending. The other good thing about it is it takes you back in time to explain certain things that happen in the movie. Very well directed. I enjoyed it that much, i took my girlfriend to see it a couple of days later, and thoroughly enjoyed it once more. Really is a must see film.

24 October 2006,A Complex Tale of Obsession and Revenge,"At the beginning of 'The Prestige', we're told that every magic trick consists of three acts: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. The first two refer to the setup of the magic trick and then its execution. In the final act, the prestige, something extraordinary occurs that defies logic. The audience is able to confirm with their own eyes that the trick worked and is, therefore, deceived into believing it's real.

Magic tricks and magic shows have a lot in common with the art of film-making: in order for a movie to be effective the audience has to be convinced by what they are seeing on the screen. Movies, after all, are nothing more than an act of smoke and mirrors. We go to the movies to be deceived, or perhaps more accurately, to escape from reality.

Director Christopher Nolan's latest film, 'The Prestige', succeeds in being a great act of deception. With a complex plot full of twists and turns, we're never sure where the story will take us next. We're also never sure if everything we're being told in the movie is the truth or that everything is real. The film's complex narrative does a great job of building suspense and dramatic tension.

'The Prestige' takes place in London at the turn of the twentieth century; a time in which magic shows were still a novelty. The plot revolves around two rival magicians who are obsessed with topping each other's tricks and undermining each other's efforts. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden, respectively. Although they start off as friends and partners, Angier and Borden turn against each other after the tragic death of Angier's wife during a dangerous magic trick. Borden is blamed for her death even though it appears to have been an accident ... or was it? 'The Prestige' is ultimately a story about obsession and revenge. Not only do Angier and Borden come to hate each other, but also they end up harming the ones they love. The pride they take in their work turns into a dangerous obsession. Both magicians are willing to go to incredible lengths to come up with the best magic trick of all time. The question is, how far will they go? The emphasis on magic, however, is only incidental to the story; it could have easily been about any competitive line of work.

All the elements are in place for a good movie. The cast, also featuring Michael Caine and Scarlett Johanssen in supporting roles, is uniformly great. Christian Bale, in particular, gives an Oscar worthy performance; he's one of the best actors of his generation and really shines here. The directing is top-notch as well, featuring beautiful cinematography and convincing sets. This should come as no surprise, however, considering the fact that director Christopher Nolan has a good track record when it comes to movies. Having previously directed 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan has impressed both audiences and film critics.

Some viewers may object to the film's complicated narrative. The story, told in flashbacks, can get confusing and sometimes makes absolutely no sense. I'm sure if one pays close enough attention, they'll see a plot hole or two. I'm willing to forgive this, however, because I appreciated the movie for its audaciousness and sense of style.

This is the second major Hollywood release in only a couple of months to be about magicians in turn-of-the-century Europe. The other being 'The Illusionist', starring Edward Norton. I have seen both films now and can say that 'The Presige' is the better of the two. It's got a more engaging story and stronger direction.

'The Prestige' is a great spectacle. Featuring a wonderful cast and top-notch production values, the film succeeds as an unforgettable cinematic experience.",8
10 April 2007,Top notch flick,"I watched this movie once on a weekend night while I had other things on my mind, but then watched it again at home by myself and felt it was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I'm not good with words, but this movie has everything a true movie goer is looking for. From theatrics to a great storyline to a great message. I gave this flick a 10 and recommend it to anyone that has a passion for movies like myself

I typed all that I was willing to say and am now simply dragging on so that my post may be seen by others.

20 October 2006,Great movie....watch close....very sci-fi with reality based detail,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

28 March 2007,Egaging Thriller,"Entertaining and thought provoking. This film uses magic as ""theMcGuffin"" in a story that is more of a Hitchcockian mystery and H.G. Welles style sci-fiction and revenge thriller. Magic, and the performance of it are the side light setting of this tale of two men obsessed with one-upsmanship, hatred, and ultimately, personal depravity.

Excellently produced, the above the title actors all perform well, some surprise luminaries show up in smaller roles, and the heart of the story is Rebecca Hall (as Bale's common law wife), turning in a tattered, star-making performance that steals the show from all the glossier people. Michael Cain keeps the action moving in a narrative role that sees quite a bit of action.

The leads here are very hard to care about, Johannson and Bale don't have much sparkle, and it is especially notable in her performance where see seems mostly rather bored, and this makes it begin to feel too long.

Jackman always has sparkle, and plays his own double  believable a completely different person, unfortunately, the double (a soused, underemployed great thespian) is more interesting than the anti-hero. Clearly, Jackman will make the transition to older character actor with a second half of his career that will eclipse all his handsome leading men. Something to look forward to!

A completely engaging and entertaining thriller, with many twists and turns, you need to keep tuned in to keep track. The final reveal happens so quickly that some may not understand what really was happening. The advert says you'll want to watch it again as soon as it is over. I did not want to, but it certainly did keep me thinking and puzzling out some of the plot points and questions of morality/mortality. ( I watched this with THE ILLUSIONIST, which was underrated, that film is much more magical and romantic, my favorite of the two.)",9
20 April 2020,Great movie,"Not only is this one of Nolan's best works it's also one of Christian Bale's best performances! Highly recommend you give this movie a watch, the ending will catch you off guard if you aren't watching closely.

22 March 2012,One of my favourite films of all time,"This has got to be one of the most original films I've ever seen, the idea of magicians pitting their illusionist skills against each other to see who's the first to cross the line is perfect for the sensibilities of Chris Nolan. The movie has his trademark non-chronological storytelling, which is a little confusing at first, but it actually enhances the smoke and mirrors quality of the film; it unfolds just like how the characters play out their tricks - the pledge, the turn, the prestige. The characters are all tortured and haunted in some way, what started off as friendly competition escalates into an obsessive bitter rivalry where nothing is sacred in order to get the one-up on the other. Simply brilliant!

20 October 2006,Don't read anything about this movie until you have seen it.,"The best way to experience this film is to know nothing about it. I didn't do any research for this film, and I feel that made the film so much better for me. All of the surprises were genuine and I really had to think about what was going on. That's rare for me, and I like David Lynch.

This was just such an effective film in terms of sophisticated entertainment. Not a film to miss. I don't want to say anymore because I could very well ruin something for you, which is not something I want to do. Just see it, and when you do, go into it blind and without any preconceived notions. It makes it so much better.

When i was watching this film, i couldn't stop myself, even i wanted to go to the loo.

There's no doubt that everyone will love this film.

""Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled. ""

I love this sentence very much, it includes all the summary and plot in this movie.

There's a lot of twists and turns, you can't believe what you've seen, the answers are always different to what you've think of....

He couldn't have been anymore right. From the get go, I admit the movie was a bit slow, but thats when the twists were thrown at you piece by piece. After that, this movie took off. The premise was amazing, and the acting was superb. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys...well... A great movie! This movie is definitely #1 on my list for the best movies of 2006.

1 October 2007,"Not expecting a great stuff, I was not disappointed.","Not expecting a great stuff, I was not disappointed.

Like the Illusionist (same year), this is not one I did like a lot.

One month separated the public coming out of these movies Once seen, is enough... (I even preferred the Illusionist, though in it the acting was like a tasteless menu)

Yes, the Prestige's acting and cast is much better than in The Illusionist, and the machinery is interesting, but for me, the supposed magic didn't work.

Good acting and decorum seldom save a whole movie...

The script is too complicated, and twisting a lot for an poor result...

Not very funny, insisting on special effect...

In fact what I appreciated was the acting as i wrote before, good if not top notch...

The rest: ""bof"" ... the french interjection perfectly describe my appreciation!

So, the same year, with an interval of a month, two ""magic films"" came out, at least for me (knowing the IMDb voters top marks for both!) for a so-so result : it must be the law of series...

Fortunately, after expecting much pleasure from the Illusionist, and in fact was just a passable OK saying, for this one my hopes were lowered : it corresponded to what I got...",
11 July 2007,"Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want?","Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want? 'The Prestige' is suspenseful, with a great cameo by a surprise actor, and sub-plots that make you watch the movie five times before putting it all together. Yes, what is better than David Bowie himself being the genius scientist? Well as good as Bowie may be, incredibly enough, a lot in this movie surpasses even him.

Magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are co-workers in their young careers working for manager Cuter (Michael Caine). The two end up being enemies after a piece of magic turns fatal. Angier and Borden then battle to become Britain's best magician while constantly trumping each other. The film shows that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive man to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away.

'The Prestige' comes from simple terminology used by magicians. As Cutter explains early in the film, there are three parts to a magic trick. The third is the prestige, which is making the object re-appear. The curiosity of the prestige of the great 'Transported Man' trick is what carries the viewers' attention throughout the film, and eventually it awes all in the conclusion.

This film is a wonderful science fiction mystery that can make anyone believe that all events in this film are or were humanly possible. The setting is the turn of the twentieth century in Great Britain. Dark colored clothes and low-key dark lighting are used to set the tone of the film. Many shots are taken under stage, in dark dressing rooms, in bedrooms at night, in prison cells, in cemeteries, in secluded forests, and in dark allies. All the foreshadowing of darkness that dawns upon all the main characters involved, from the headlining magicians down to the scientist secluded on a mountainside.

The dark colors and close facial shots are very reminiscent of Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind'. Both flicks have a wonderful ability to hold movie-goers' attention and make them debate the possible outcomes up until the end of the film and even after viewing.

The magicians show that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive them to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away. See for yourself what the consequences are of these decisions.",10

9 November 2006,The Prestige is Nolan's masterpiece!,"With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece of a mind bender, in essence, he has created a cinematic magic trick (much like the novel is a literary magic trick). Everyone is in absolute perfect form and you can tell that at this point, everyone in terms of Nolan's crew, is right on the same plane. The performances are top notch, Hugh Jackman shows us range and emotion that he has not yet displayed on the screen. Wally Pfisters cinematography is absolutely radiant, capturing the light and shadows and bringing another time period alive. Nathan Crowley's production design is impeccable, he has constructed complex and detailed sets that evoke the time period and the atmosphere of this rather dark film.

For me to say that this is Nolan's best film so far is certainly tough. All of Nolan's films are masterpieces in their own right, but I think that The Prestige is a knock-out. I can only hope that come Oscar time, this film and all of the individuals involved are remembered for their flawless film-making.",10
15 March 2020,Hidden Gem,"Stumbled across this masterpiece, and so glad I did. Fantastic cast that includes Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanson, and a great cameo from the now departed David Bowie (he actually does a sterling performance for once). The acting is fab, the directing is brilliant and the storyline with its twists and turns, and one of the best endings will leave you amazed that you'll want to watch it again and again. Don't be put off by the fact that it's about 2 magicians. Its much much more than this.

26 January 2008,"Magical ""the Prestige""","For those who haven't seen ""the prestige"" yet, i can strongly recommend it to you.The Prestige follows a cleverly constructed story about two magicians,who become rivals, and will stop at nothing to triumph over the other.The movie builds up lots of tension, as both magicians try to harm or destroy the others ones life. I think it's better if you watch this movie with some friends, so that you can discuss your theory about why this and that happened, with them. The acting from hugh jackman and Christian bale couldn't be better.I like the dark and mysterious look of the film and that you don't really understand the whole story until the end. 10 stars for the prestige.

24 February 2010,One of Nolan's and Bale's most prestigious films which proves gripping and enthralling,"If any director could make a film about two rival magicians who compete for a few tricks to bedazzle against each other at every prospect, then Christopher Nolan has definitely proved the man for the job. His almost trademark nonlinear narrative structure is as far from hackneyed as Christian Bale is having an angry outburst at the director of photography on a film (oops sorry about that Christian).

Robert and Alfred - Bale and Jackman are two manic, manipulative magicians (like what I did with the m's there?) whose obsession with trickery and determination to be the best of the best plays a huge motivation for The Prestige. And it is all cleverly manifests by all the intervening past scenes that show how the smallest details became significant to the present day plot where our story begins; but by present day I mean early 20th century.

So with these flashbacks you can expect plenty of 'Ahhhh I see how they did that' moments and a plot with so many layers it will match your homemade birthday cake. But Nolan can't receive all the credit for what makes this film so riveting. The rivalry between Bale and Jackman is intense and real sense of history and abhorrence is among them, so much so that it feels like World War three could break out at any moment. Scarlett Johansson though slightly underused for such a talented actress provides numerous ardent scenes between the main leads and shows she isn't just someone to ogle at in a corset - no complaints about that though.

On this form Nolan's Inception should be a blast which The Prestige will no doubt wet your appetite for and give you a reason to watch over and over again not that one is needed anyway.",10
6 November 2006,What happened to The Prestige?,"There are three acts in every magic trick, as Sir Michael Cane says, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Just like the three acts of these so-called illusions, The Prestige is played out like its subject. Christopher Nolan's newest endeavor tells the story of two magicians, Robert Angier, played by the overtly childish Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by the always consuming Christian Bale.

Separated by a magic trick gone bad, involving Angier's wife, Julia Angier (Piper Parabo) , the two magicians become rivals, sabotaging each others illusions at an attempt to destroy their credibility. The plot thickens as Angier becomes obsessed with one of Borden's newest tricks, due to his inability to understand its inner workings. Plagued with his misunderstanding of the illusion, Angier attempts to copy or re-create the trick, but due to its finally, never enjoys the audiences amazement after the prestige is finally revealed.

Nolan uses a non-linear storyline to confuse us, and to ultimately try and take attention away from some of the vast plot holes within the films twists, turns and surprises. Despite its flaws within the plot and some of the mediocre acting, compliments of the ever so dull, faintly British accented Scarlett Johansson, The Prestige does lend a sort of entrancement into the world of 18th century magicians only Nolan could make alluring. Teaming back up with his brother Jonathan Nolan, the writing/directing team has fallen miles short of their first collaboration, the artfully masterful play on the human memory, Memento.

When The Prestige finally shows us the prestige, or third act of its illusion, it is not as shocking as Nolan intended it to be. It seems that the brotherly duo tried too hard in the implementation of the prestige, they forgot to solidify the first two acts of the film or trick, depending on how far you would like to take this metaphor. Finally, The Prestige is a beautiful piece of film, with a few flaws that keep it from being a perfect film, but will surely be an upstanding contender in this years Oscar race.",7
29 July 2008,An excellent movie to watch after ages............,"Well, what can i say, it was one of the best movies i ever watched. Christopher Nolan has always been one of my favorite Hollywood directors. I have always enjoyed all his movies, whether it was the memorable Memento or the beginning of the new chapter in Batman Begins. But over here, Nolan has managed to portray a fine movie despite making some changes to the original plot by Christopher Priest. Nolan has managed to pull out excellent performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine, as ever is, dependable on his role as the sidekick. The ending of the movie actually leaves the viewer gasping for more. I strongly suggest this movie for viewers to watch.

23 October 2006,Now this is a movie!,"This movie was not quite what I was expecting. It was even better by a few leaps and bounds. There was nothing cliché about it. Even at the end there was no real good guy or bad guy. No clear moral lesson. The characters and story were kept very human. What I thought might end up a fantastical unbelievable story was very real and even thought provoking. There was only one fantastical element to the film but it was still presented in such a way as to not take away from the characters themselves and the drama between them. The acting was also very impressive. I never doubted the characters for a minute. Not a one. The run time is kind of long. However,unlike Peter Jackson's King Kong I was never bored, never just waiting for the story to pick up. I don't see how it could be a serious complaint and really it's the only thing approaching one that I've heard about this great film. I really have no complaints about this movie. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing it I highly recommend you do.

24 October 2006,"An intense, visually magical, emotionally charged piece of work","The visual experience of this extremely authentic period piece, consummate acting and storyline will leave most earnest moviegoers with a truly exhilarating experience. You expect the leading actors to do something familiar from their other work but they give us new dimensions. Michael Caine again proves his timeless value to the enhancement of any role while David Bowie offers a portrait of elegant, aged sophistication fronting electrical spectaculars, ancient reminders of Ziggy Stardust. Although the film has slower expository moments, the contribution to the grand finale is something to behold. If magic is what you wish for, magic is what you will receive. The name only belies the true ""Prestige"" of the final act. There are facets that make this film watchable with a repetitiveness that will seem tireless. It can and will involve a satisfaction and identification of inner emotions that are played out and identified by all of us. The film can easily define the recently modern terminology ""obsessive-compulsive"" behavior. It also can serve as a guide on the price of success at any cost affecting so many of our fellow human beings today. For those who scrutinize detail, there are scenes of turn of the century London you will find irreconcilable with modern sanitation and relative cleanliness of large cities. The artifacts, apparatus, equipment, and scenery seem to have been crafted with such exact precision as to have been transported from history. The character of Nicola Tesla was real and a real genius overshadowed by Edison; Tesla and elements of his work are still shrouded in mystery to this day. In summation, this movie is magical and a fulfilling treat for those with imagination and the absolute enjoyment of carefully merged fact with unknown possibilities.",9
19 January 2012,Very bad and boring...,"This movie was bad, really bad. It is longer than it should have been. It has no twists and no interesting story.

At first I thought it would have been a cool movie where I enjoy the battle of wits between two magician. But this movie has none of that. It is just so predictable.

The other problem I had with this movie is that it has no lovable character. Everyone is just an asshole and I don't feel like supporting any of these guys.

And when you sit down and think about it, what the hell is the point of wasting your life for a stupid magic show. These character motivations make no sense, in fact the characters themselves make no sense at all. They are like robots.

Bottomline, the movie is bad.",1

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

27 February 2007,Most confusing movie!,"I HATED this film. From the mumbling bumbling dialog to the so-called ""twisted"" ending.... Did not know who was who... so you all say that what was great about it.... I didn't think so. I found it very hard to follow. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Did not know what was going on, past, present or future....who knows. I had a very difficult time understanding what Christian Bale was saying, they all spoke so softly, plus the accents! The movie ended and all I could say was what a waste of time. It was way too long too! Save yourself a lot of thinking and see The Illusionist! Much, much better movie, better acting and very entertaining!

6 July 2021,Higher than Citizen Kane?,"I liked The Prestige but this is seriously higher rated than Citizen Kane? The Prestige wasn't even the best movie the year it came out. Citizen Kane is on top of every list. These ratings need to be overhauled. The prestige is solid though but a 7.7 or something would be a lot more reasonable.

11 September 2012,"The conclusion is comically implausible, but the preceding two hours are thoroughly engaging.","Ultimately, like so many of Christopher Nolan's films, 'The Prestige' is ridiculous and far-fetched. The story twists in a way that beggars belief, in a way that's so desperately lacking in plausibility that one asks themselves 'Did I hear that correctly? Has it really just gone in that direction?' Thankfully, this occurs at the end of the film, the preceding two hours produce, generally speaking, a delightfully realistic, taut and human period drama that engrosses far more than I expected.

The film follows two magicians Roger Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) whose rivalry becomes so bitter and intense that it escalates to deception and violence. Their desperate attempts to exceed each other are genuinely engrossing, especially when Borden first develops 'The Transported Man'. Angier and Borden's romantic partners, Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) and Sarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) respectively, are dragged into the acerbic rivalry, resulting in betrayal, adultery and depression.

Indeed, the aforementioned twist is a vital device that makes the film, in the writers' minds at least, 'work', which means the film is rather flawed. The climax undermines everything that made the film good, but those two hours soften the blow considerably. All performances are solid, particularly Rebecca Hall's, who has a real, sweet naturalness about her that struck me as soon as she graced the screen.

Christian Bale's accent takes at least 40 minutes to get accustomed to, it has an odd, contrived strain to it that normally only appears in interviews. As everyone knows, he's British, but I think his true accent was lost in Hollywood a long time ago, I'm no longer sure what his real accent is, and I don't think he does either.",
30 October 2006,"great movie! """"must see""""","This was an EXCELLENT movie!! One of the best I've seen. This is my favorite movie of all time. With suspense, unpredictable plot, and a touch of romance has made this movie a movie for every type of person. If you already love Christian Bale this movie will make you love him even more. The writers are absolute GENIUS'S!!! They wrote this movie amazingly! Even throughout all the twists they made it perfectly plausible and fairly easily understood. I think I'm going to write to the writers congratulating them on such an EXCELLENT movie. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johannson, and Michael Caine, did a SUPERB job. They timed everything perfectly, and the emotion was entirely believable. There were multiple quotes that I will remember for a very long time they were just so GOOD! On the drive home after seeing this movie you will just not be able to stop talking about it. Throughout the seemingly serious plot, there are several parts that will just make you laugh out loud. All in all this was a SUPERB movie!! Not one even close to being as good! TWO THUMBS UP!

9 January 2007,Absolutely Fantastical.,"This is a movie. A movie of such epic proportions I hardly know what to write. Except that it is absolutely incredible. But with the acting talents of Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Van Helsing), Christian Bale (Batman Begins), Michael Caine (Children of Men) combined with the director of Batman Begins Christopher Nolan what else can you expect. The actors are all perfect for their roles. Scarlett Johansen tends to annoy me but she was actually pretty good in this movie.

This movie takes an in depth look at human nature: Its struggle for revenge, its need to be at the top, and its obsession and duplicity. The pledge, turn, and prestige of this film are all deftly executed and the special effects and symbolism are incredible. All in all, a must see. I will be greatly surprised if it doesn't take home some little gold statues.

21 October 2006,Best movie I've ever seen!,"I just came from seeing the movie and it is now by far my favorite movie of all time. I had hoped this movie would be as good as the trailer made it seem, and it DEFINITELY was. I really don't like all the mainstream crap that's stamped out like a cookie cutter, so this dark, intelligent, fun, and imaginative movie was great. And it really keeps you thinking--trying to figure out what you just saw after it's over. Great acting, time-period setting, and twisting plot too. Just a great all around movie. Can't think of anything else it reminds me of really. The confusing nature and multi-level plot and meaning reminds me a little of ""Lost Highway.""

ONLY thing I didn't like was a couple birds dying.

18 November 2006,Best Film of the Year,"Earlier tonight I went to the cinema with a few friends to see The Prestige. I had seen Casino Royale the day before and felt that was the best film I had seen this year by a long way. However this all changed when I saw The Prestige. Not only boasting a great cast that included Jackman, Bale, Johansson, Caine but also a fantastic director and an exceptional screenplay composed by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Without giving too much away all I can say about the story is I think it contains some of the best story telling I have ever seen on the big screen. The acting in the film is also of a great quality with probably Jackman's best performance and Christian Bale continuing from where he left of with Batman Begins.

Simply this is the best film I have seen all year and one of the best I have ever seen. A must see.

29 October 2006,An intricate story line with superb twists,"I was intrigued with the trailers of this movie and thought they did it justice.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were excellent in their roles!I could almost feel their anguish and anger as each part of the movie unfolded.I was very pleased how they worked their diaries/journals into the plot with surprising results.Jealousy and hate were mixed in with their admiration of each other.Scarlett Johansen is remarkable in her role and is always a welcome addition to any successful movie.Michael Caine was wonderful and added beautifully to the support and the success of this movie.David Bowie was also a pleasant surprise. I feel he was highly believable as the reclusive scientific genius.In summation, I am happy to had the opportunity to view this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves mystery and intrigue.

20 December 2006,"Fantastic, the second time around.","This movie has a lot of twists and I admit I was confused the first time around.

Watch it again and everything makes sense. It seems a little more confusing then it actually is. Whatever you are thinking what is going on, you are probably right.

2 magicians in 20th century London, played by Hugh Jackman (Angier)and Christian Bale (Borden), go to desperate attempts to try and out do each other.

Michael Caine was fabulous as an adviser/manager of Angier.

I think Scarlett Johannson is a terrible actress and she disappointed in this movie as well, luckily you are so intrigued by the 2 main stars you don't care.

One of my faves this year. 8/10.",8
11 January 2011,No Spoiler,"This was the only movie of Christopher Nolan which was yet to watch for me.. It's a wonderful movie.. Though it's rated below Nolan's some other works, but i find it really good, as good as the likes of dark knight and inception if not better .

The movie revolves around the rivalry between two magician , set upon nineteenth century, Nolan shown that era quite wonderfully ..

And like almost all Nolan movies, it has an mind jolting ending. and so many twists and turns :)

Performance is eqaully good from both hugh jackman and Christian bale as the two rival magician. And the ladies haven't got much to do but rebecca hall and scarlett johansson does well .. and o'course michael caine , as always in all the Nolan movies (batman series and inception) excelled in his small but significant role.

lastly i just wanna say ""Are u watching Closely? "" ;)",10

3 November 2006,The best fill of all time,"...Okay I know thats saying much but I mean it... I have watched a lot of movies, new and old. Like most anyone, I really like this movie. I'm not sure why it was rated PG-13...but then again it couldn't as well have been rated PG.... but I saw nothing in it that was PG-13 Worthy... Seeing how mostly PG-13 movies now and days can slip one ""F"" word in the movie... I was searching hard to try and find this one... and I could not. I do remember hearing a few words but no one seems to really care about it as much. But as for the speech that was good. The story was great! It kept you guessing and wondering what was going on. I love that aboot a movie!! :) I was on the edge of my seat the whole time... the story was just amazing and left you so ... just amazingly lost!!!

If you love magic or love to know how things are done.. Here is a great twist for you...watch and fall in love with the thrill and mystery of the whole movie!... In Short... I love love LOVE the Prestige!

4 November 2006,"Great movie, not for all ages like some others have recommended.","This movie is really well done in a lot of aspects outlined by other posters. However, it is definitely not for all ages. This is the kind of movie that parents will take their third graders to and then their teachers have to listen to them talk about their nightmares for the next several weeks. I work in a school, and it happens more often than you think.

If you go see this movie, do your children a favor and leave them at home with a good sitter and a more age appropriate movie. It's rated PG-13 for good reasons. My husband and I had our viewing interrupted by more than one crying child, it was appalling that people would expose small children to a show like that. If you think your kids will be OK with it, go watch it first and decide if the actual content is really OK.

20 September 2021,People believe what they want to believe,"You're not really looking for the secret. You want to be fooled.

An early 1900s period piece about dueling magicians doesn't exactly sound like the beginning of a description to a mystery/thriller movie, but maybe that's the magician known as Christopher Nolan's trick after all. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and certainly not least Michael Caine deliver great performances as a pair of egotistical magicians, each with their own flair. Bale has the tricks, but Jackman has the showmanship and the ability to wow the audience.

Woven in among this is a tale of two men in obsessive competition to be the best, a tale of revenge, and a tale of the powerful price one must pay in order to become the best. Far be it from me to ruin anyone on the plot details of this movie, but suffice to say that the magic in this movie won't be lost on anyone, but it will certainly leave you with a sense of wonder.",9

30 August 2021,Overrated but Good,"My only criticism is the way Angier did his final trick was a bit too unrealistic, like it was cheating. It also was buying his way out, so also cheating. I also just didn't like the premise of two men for two hours competing over who has the bigger stick regardless of how it started. But otherwise it was a great watch and great cast.

7 April 2014,The Final Line of the Movie,"I'm not going to add one more redundant review to the thousands already here, but I do feel the need to make some points about the last line in the movie (without spoilers and without revealing the secret or making it easy).

Note that I am not talking about the double twist ending that explains everything - I am talking about the final line that seems to add one more point after the twists are done.

Nolan is a very logical writer and makes every detail in his movies fit together like a puzzle. He even made dreams into something very mechanical in Inception. He always plays it straight and gives the audience plenty of clues, allowing us to catch on to everything as long as we focus and use our brains.

So the last line in this movie puzzled me because it seemed to just be an ambiguous tease whereas everything before then was made very clear, and this doesn't fit in with Nolan's style.

In addition, the sci-fi elements in this movie bothered me. They didn't fit either. But the final line in the movie turns these into something else in a brilliant way.

There is a very definite and obvious solution to all this, and the final line is very clear once you understand what it is saying and figure out its secret. But don't forget that the secrets of magic are 'disappointingly simple' once you figure them out.

I will not spell it out for you because that would be wrong, but I will give you one clue: Think about the words, and then think about who he is saying it to.

Another clue is the speech given by Angier at the end about the reason he does magic for the audience. This speech also seems out of place unless you realize he is saying it for someone else involved in the movie.

I thought the movie rated 7-8 until the last line of the movie clicked into place. Then it became a ten.",10
5 November 2006,The Prestige- 2 magicians in battle,"BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!! If you are human you will love this movie. I can't believe even 1.1% of people thought this movie was awful this movie deserves a 73289754093 out of 10. If you want to see a movie that shows you the dangers of obsession, this is the movie for u (and also for people who don't want to see a movie about that.) Good for over people 12 and over. No sex scenes, but contains blood at times. There is no movie better than this one. After I watched it I watched another movie (Bridget's Jones's Diary) and I couldn't appreciate it because it just wasn't The Prestige. That is only bad part about it, I can never watch another movie in the same way. It will take Hollywood years to top it.

11 January 2020,Great Movie...,"Christopher Nolan, who brought us the Dark Knight re-boot of Batman, as well as Inception in recent years wrote/produced/directed this brilliant film about two magicians and the deadly consequences of their professional and personal rivalries.

The cast is flawless, well-paced, and the use of flashbacks very effectively ties together a complex story that resolves itself in a most satisfying ending that will no doubt surprise the first-time viewer.

This is a fantastic film with a wonderfully twisty story, incredible acting, and excellent period detail. Every piece of the puzzle creates a simply tasteful and complex story between two men plagued by an obsession to be the greatest, blinding each to the other.

20 November 2006,Greatest movie of all time,"I am a person that is normally into sports movies and ones with a lot of action and hype. I went with my friend to see this movie who had watched Memento before and said it was good, so I figured he was right because he normally is, and this was directed by the same person so we checked it out. As soon as we started to leave the theater, we both decided this was the best movie that any of us had ever seen and we are going to see it for a fourth time tomorrow. Each time we see it, it stays just as good as the first time. It is the type of movie that you could watch 10 times in a day, and it would be just as good the tenth time as it was the first. I cannot wait for this movie to come out onto DVD. I would buy it at any price they set it at on the very first day it comes out. If you have yet to see this movie, just watch it and you will feel the same way.

29 December 2006,"Pledge, Turn ,Prestiges everywhere!","Besides the two main characters rivalry, and the notable overall Nolan's trick i d like to mention: -very suitable Scarlet Yohansson's acting cause it meant to be flat. (She's the blond assistant remember?!!). Watch out for her trick. -Kane is great cause his acting is suitable for someone who just cannot be the magician. Besides that he plays all the same to me. Every f. time. Anyway watch how works his trick in the plot as the assistant's above.

SPOILER follows!

The film was so compact! You can't take anything out. I ll only criticize Nolan on the bit early focusing on the engineer character. Too early focus i think.

Anyway, among the best ever! dz

21 October 2006,Greatest Triumph of the Year,"One of the greatest movies i have ever seen! its a mind bending illusion, a well-performed marvel by one of the best up and coming directors, Christopher Nolan. Roll out the red carpet, because I'm thinking Oscars!! An amazing screenplay written by Jonathan Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat, stumped and guessing until the end! Brilliant film-making and it keeps me pumped and ready for the next Nolan picture, The Dark Knight, which is a sequel to the also awesome Christopher Nolan movie, Batman Begins. Also written by Jonathan Nolan, it should be a great follow-up to this mind game of a movie by the newest elite director on the market.

This tale however is more than meets the eye. More than just a pitiful attempt to garner some attention by preforming sad illusions to friends and family. This film captures the gritty underbelly of the magic realm often not seen by the average newb. Once you stray from the light and turn down the path of darkness... there is no going back. Or is there? Either way, you're still a magician and have to fight for air time a little Peter Parker's birthday party only to be upstaged by a clown who can make a boss balloon sword.

4 April 2007,The Prestige,"The Prestige is another example (as if one is needed) of director Christopher Nolan's talent behind the camera. Here he has crafted an intimate film that feels like a blockbuster with such a natural flair for solid storytelling that I would have no difficulties in saying that he is - despite only making a handful of films - one of, if not the, best British filmmaker around.

The film concerns two magicians in turn-of-the-century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) is on trial for the murder of Robert Angier (Jackman), and the film slowly unravels the story of Borden's and Angier's friendship that, after a tragic accident that leaves Angier's wife dead, turns into a bitter rivalry. When Angier sees a trick of Borden's that he describes as ""the best magic trick I have ever seen"", he becomes obsessed with discovering Borden's secret.

Of Nolan's' films, The Prestige is most like Memento, at least in terms of its narrative structure. It is chronologically mixed up, forcing the viewer to pay constant attention to what is going on, as it can take a while to work out exactly when a particular scene is set (there are no subtitle clues or such like). This can prove slightly disorientating at first, but it is just another way for Nolan to keep his audience guessing, and keep the suspense up. Indeed, the constant build up of suspense feels in many ways like a well crafted horror film, with the film drenched in period atmosphere and misdirection.

On the topic of period, The Prestige is also noticeable for not forcing the time period on the audience. There are no sweeping shots showing us the grandeur of Victorian London or any such thing; the camera is constantly focusing on the characters, not their surroundings, and this combined with the use of a hand-held camera gives the film a near-claustrophobic feel, accentuating the mood still further.

Performance-wise, both the main characters give the best performances of their careers  Jackman especially showing depth that his recent blockbuster films have not allowed him to do. His portrayal of Angier first evokes our sympathy, but his descent into obsession quickly makes us reconsider who our loyalties lie with. Borden, who seems to be the clear-cut villain of the film, begins to steal our sympathies away from Angier despite knowing that he is certainly no better a person than Angier becomes. Of the supporting cast, Michael Caine is as strong as ever, and David Bowie's odd choice of casting is let go by his steely characterisation of Nikola Tesla. Only Scarlett Johansson disappoints with a dodgy English accent failing to give her role any spark. But her role is small and thus not a great dent to the film.

The film seems so based in a fictional reality that the more fantastical scenes that crop up (involving the real life character of Tesla and his involvement in Borden's/Angier's tricks) seem to go a little too far; stick with it though, and the result is an incredibly well constructed tale with brilliant performances that really will keep you guessing right up until the end.

The bad points? Well, like any magic trick, once you know the secret, the trick becomes less special. In fairness to Nolan, the audience has to know the big secret for the film to make any sense. However, as if the film was a magic trick, the ending takes something away from the rest of the film. It's not that it cheapens the film  indeed, the ending is handled quite expertly  it's just that one wishes the trick could stay and wonder us for a long time to come, rather than be revealed. It's a shame that films can't do this like true magic can, because otherwise The Prestige would be on it's way to being the perfect ten.

Rated: 8.5/10

10 January 2021,This is Perfect Filmmaking,"Really successful movies are the ones audiences watch over and over. Sometimes a movie delivers thrills or suspense that viewers just can't get enough of. In rarer cases, a film springs a surprise reveal so unexpected that viewers will want to see it multiple times to catch everything they missed the first time. The Prestige is one of those best-of-the-best movies that does both.

The Prestige is a dark and beautiful tragedy about a competition between two rival magicians, sworn enemies who are engaged in a race to the bottom. The story is framed by careful editing and cuts across multiple timelines which hint that neither man is exactly what he appears to be.

What is shown is enough to lead to inevitable judgements about both men, but as the timelines converge in rapid succession at the film's climax, a series of reveals forces us to rethink everything we thought we knew about each man, and the true nature of what we've been watching them do.

Rewatching The Prestige shows that all the clues were there the whole time, so much so that you are forced to wonder how you never saw it coming the first time through. With each successive showing you see more clues.

It's clear that the filmmakers combed through the script, carefully crafting every line of dialogue to taunt the viewer his second time through. Indeed, you haven't really seen The Prestige until you've seen it the second time through, when it becomes clear that every action and consequence from the movie's beginning to its end all convey the same theme without ever casting moral judgment on the viewer or insulting his intelligence.

The story is engaging and immersive, cerebral and complex but not too fast or too busy to keep up with. And while the viewer knows Hollywood can fake magic perfectly, at no time does the audience ever scoff at The Prestige or doubt it. This is honest entertainment, rendered by believable performances, and worthy of being seen again and again.",10
3 December 2006,the REAL prestige,"The Prestige, a movie that will bend your mind. The prestige, a movie that will bend your back as you desperately try to see the hidden clues that you may have missed earlier on. here's my opinion on the movie. lets start with Huge Jackman. the name says it all. Jackman being Australian slang for bender of minds and back and basically thats what he does in this movie. he is great and really presents a perfect layered performance. you never really understand what he's saying but you get the feeling that he knows what he's doing. it always helps to have the ability to act through understanding and huge has got this. Scarllett Johansun, a great actor, was brilliant in mean girls and certainly has the ability to act and bend minds, but let's just say that the word fugal come to mind when talking about her performance. she knows it and it shows. George Lucas once said that if an actor doesn't want to be in a movie and doesn't believe the magic that they are presenting then it will show on film. George was right. Scarllett doesn't believe in magic and its clear. she never says anything supportive of Huge Jackman or Christin Bale because she obviously doesn't believe in magic. she needs to let herself go more and be free and stop holding onto prejudices of black people and magicians. everyone else in the movie was fine, great even. watch out for the star cameo role (you'll know it when you see it). let's just say that the butler from the nanny named Fran would approve. Anyway, ce'lar vee, a great movie but don't see it coz u probably wont get it at all. PS Huge definitely has a notable bulge in his pants in the opening scene. i think it could help for any Oscar nods. i would give it 8 but that bulge is worth at least a 10 by itself.",10
25 February 2011,Are you watching closely?,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",9
29 December 2020,Dark and depressing but good,"Maybe because I'm British at heart I like Mr. Nolan.

Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.

It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.

I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary",8
17 December 2006,Awesome Movie!!!!,"The movie is riveting! There are twists and turns throughout the movie. You always feel as if you are there instead of watching. Michael Cane, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman do an excellent job portraying their characters. All 3 of them are very believable and were born to play these roles. Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job directing the movie as well. I thought this movie was so good, i plan on buying it on DVD. When you see this movie, pay close attention; it is one of those movies where every detail is there for a reason. Your eyes will be glued to the screen the entire time. I saw the movie, left, and continued talking about it the rest of the week. The movie is incredible. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

21 December 2007,"If you've seen one magician movie, you've seen 'em all","This was a fine movie in some ways. The actors were excellent, especially Michael Caine. The action kept moving. The twists (and you know there are going to be twists in a movie about magicians) keep on coming.

However, the movie has a lot of flaws: The editing among all the different chronological sequences is confusing. I think the director intended us to be unsure of (for instance) who is reading whose diary when. It's not that hard to sort out where we are given a minute or so following every jump in time and space, but after a while it's annoying to think the director requires such tactics to keep us off balance.

The part played by Nicola Tesla is ridiculous. My jaw dropped toward the end of the movie after they asked us to accept such a preposterous piece of pseudo-history.

Scarlet Johanssen's accent is consistent, but how come it's the accent of an upper-class Englishwoman, when she's hanging out with these low-class magicians? At least it's better than David Bowie's accent. He is supposed to be Croatian but sounds like a stoned Scotsman.

The skimpy costumes worn by the magicians' assistants seemed too skimpy for Victorian times.

I guess I just don't like magician movies. They're always about revealing how tricks are really done, and, as someone says early on in the film, If you reveal the secret of the trick, you instantly lose the audience's respect. To compensate for that, they have to rise to a crescendo of revelations, and it's never enough compensation for me.",6
20 May 2008,Extraordinary!!!,"According to the dictionary, the prestige means: ""reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes"". The prestige is what Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan have for making such a good movie.

The plot is extraordinary. Just like any magic act, the story also has three parts. In the 'Pledge', we are introduced to the two magicians, competing against each other for the better act. On one hand there is Angier, who loves his wife and believes it is showmanship that makes an act great. On the other hand we have Borden who believes you need to make sacrifices and live your act, not just perform it, to make it great. In the 'Turn', Bordon accidentally kills Angier's wife and Angier wants revenge. The competition between the two starts getting dirty, each one trying to sabotage the other's act. Then Bordon comes up with 'the transported man'. Angier is unable to replicate this act and becomes desperate to find Bordon's secret. Both men in their constant effort to best each other end up destroying their family and their lives. The 'Prestige' is truly the Coup de grace of the movie where the secrets and sacrifices of the two magicians are revealed and everything beautifully but shockingly falls into place.

The movie is a tale of obsession, love, sacrifice, misdirection, revenge and 'getting your hands dirty'. Maybe I haven't seen a lot of movies but The Prestige gave me what I had never seen before. Do watch it.",9
20 February 2007,Unique!,"It's a movie that could change the way you ""act"" your life, and interact with people, things and feelings around you. It may get you to study about the magic tricks and illusions and there you will understand after a while, the thing that this movie shows. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Actors, writers, directors and all crew! Bravo! And really looking through the other comments, and judging by myself i really don't think i have seen anything like it. And the music gets you involve a lot, some said it's a little too long, the time you INVEST watching this movie deserves every minute. And i would ask each and everyone of you that saw this movie and read this comment: ""share it with all the people you know"", don't start to tell them more than you can see on-line, the description of it, send them to the theater to see it.

1 May 2007,Highly Recommended,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I saw it in theaters with my friends and was crying hysterically at the end. one of the last lines is really a killer. You have to see it at least twice to get EVERYTHING, because it is pretty fast paced compared to other movies with a lot of details. The ending will have you shocked, astonished, and willing to watch it again and again. I'm very very glad that this movie made IMDb's top 250 movie list because it deserves to be up there. Even though it didn't win any Oscars or golden globes, I know that they did a phenomenal job on it. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are fantastic actors to begin with, and this was the first movie I've seen with Scarlett Johansson in it. If you haven't seen it, go rent it NOW!

3 January 2014,I wish I could give this movie a ten...,"... but after watching it quite a few times I have to honestly say something is missing for me. I remember watching it for the first time, I was quite impressed by the story, the way it was built up and delivered, the cast and the acting, and basically everything about the movie. I think the point where it becomes a little too much is towards the end of the movie. Without giving out spoilers I can say that the ending is something you would expect but is still shocking, although by the time it arrives you already know everything that's going on and this way it doesn't hit you as hard as it should. I have to absolutely mention that I liked everything about this film and I still love and will always love this movie. But my mind just doesn't want to settle with a ten for some reason.

3 February 2016,A lecture on narrative,"The movie begins by letting the public know that in a magic trick there are three acts:

-The premise, where we are shown an ordinary object, like a canary.

-The change, where something extraordinary happens to this object. The canary disappears. But you don't clap yet, because you know that something else must happen, you are waiting for it.

-Finally, in the prestige, the magician brings the ordinary object back. And that's when you clap. You think you are trying to figure out how he did it, but actually, you don't really want it. Because deep down you know that the old canary is smashed under the table.

This is a narrative masterpiece, and we are being told what is going to happen straight from the beginning. Nolan takes an ordinary story of two magicians' rivalry; gives it an extraordinary plot twist, and while you are trying to figure out what is the trick behind it, he brings back the ordinary to the movie.

But, just like in a magician's show, he needs to build up the tension. In a normal show, a magician begins with the simple stuff, something rather interesting yet nothing unique. Throughout the show, things get more amazing, until you get to the second to last trick, which you think it tops it all. But then it comes the last trick, the truly jaw dropping one; and you realize that the previous trick was simply the second best.

A highly recommendable movie to pretty much anyone.",9

10 November 2006,5 stars out of 5!,"this movie is sixth sense on steroids. there are so many twists and turns that just when the audience gets its footing, they are swept off their feet again. the movie does take a strong stomach, but is well worth the effort. make sure you know who Nickolas Tesla was before watching the film, because his life states theme of the movie, and helps clarify the thematic elements for the audience. i find it ironic that only 50 years past his death does he finally find the success that alluded him in life. the cast is excellent, the screenplay magnificent, and if politics didn't play such a huge part in the academy awards, i would smell Oscar.

22 October 2006,This was a great Movie.,"I loved this movie. It was like watching David Copperfield or better Houdini. The entire movie kept me guessing. Don't miss the first 5 minutes or you will be lost through the entire movie. At my theater there was no previews. So there were many people who came in late. I am going to see it again, just so I can really enjoy it. Now that I know how it ends. This will surprise you. THis is not a movie for children under ten, because they will be asking through the entire movie, ""What just happened"". This movie I think will be one of the movies that will be watched 10 or 20 years from now, It is timeless and will be considered a classic. Have fun.

6 February 2007,Whats the ending credits song called?,"I would like to know what the song is called when the credits role? The song at the very end is quite good i would like to know the title of the ending song. It is played right after Micheal Ciane says all of the acts and after you see the final image the credits begin to role and the song begins, i just want to know the title of that song its very catchy, it has a cool beat to it and the vocals are good too. the movie overall was amazing i never thought the twists would end there were so many times where i thought that it was the final conclusion but there was always something much more exciting that would be later revealed. I really started to follow Christian bale's character up until Huge jackmans new trick which i didn't see coming at all, the ending however was really good i really enjoyed this movie.

31 January 2007,The best movie of 2006,"I really liked this movie, specially the metaphors and plays about the different identities of the characters and the astonishing tricks. I was so amazed that i decided to spend all my life trying to obtain the ""Transported Man"" trick. I've given a first try, check it out!

Copy and paste: http://one.revver.com/watch/157915

Just to be honest, i've to say that many of the techniques and the ideas shown in this movie had been already used by the director Christopher Nolan in ""Memento"", which is with no doubt (imho, obviously) his real masterpiece: flashbacks, enigmas, ambiguity of the characters, etc. Perhaps ""Memento"" is a little excessive; in order to fully understand the movie you must watch it almost twice (with high level of attention). ""The Prestige"" is a more commercial version of Memento, but it includes all the features and the ideas that made fantastic Memento.

24 November 2016,well worth watching,"The supreme casting, the set, props and costumes all make this into a great movie. I was drawn in and left in suspense, and amongst the tricks there are some left unexplained. I love that.

The Prestige isabout revenge and rivalry, and it aims to trick both the theater audience in the film, and You! But even though I could see through the plot, it never bored me. The characters are complicated, and you never really know who to root for. The main characters, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, are both cynical, but you feel empathy for both of them. Scarlett Johansson, Micheal Caine and Rebecca Hall also do their roles very well. Well worth watching,

4 November 2006,Powerful !!!,"Christopher Nolan has directed excellent movies before. There's always a great deal of mystery in his films. This is no exception. Just like in Memento, in the Prestige he uses a fractured time line, giving the necessary information of the future for you to keep wondering how it got there, but he saves the secret for the last minutes.

This film is about two magicians who, having been friends and co-workers, begin a rivalry that will eventually destroy them. Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect. If you add that to the acting of Bale, Jackman and the other cast members (Caine, Johanssen, Bowie), a romantic sideline and the sci-fi touch, you get one of the best movies in the decade. No doubt about that.

I didn't even recognize David Bowie, who plays Tesla. It was a creepy movie and at times I had to close my eyes. This movie isn't suitable for young children under 13. It involves drowning, shooting and chopping off parts of the body. It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts. Parents, go see the movie next and then judge to see if it is suitable for your children. Teens, this movie is made for you.

3 November 2006,A mixed bag of tricks.,"The Good: Great plot twists, very cool magic tricks, and of course, Michael Caine.

The Prestige follows this with true style, and the first time you see Alfred (Bale) perform his trick, ""The Transported Man,"" your jaw will be hanging down as you think, ""how the hell did he just do that?"" It's moments like that that make this movie lots of fun to watch, but you will certainly long for more than they give you, taking into account the length of the movie. At two hours and twenty-one minutes, it's like a roller-coaster going at half-speed. Sure, there's thrills, but it still leaves everyone hungry for a boost in the pace. Probably the best (and worst) example of this is a moment in the film's finale when, as a certain character dies, his last breath seems to come out twenty different times for him to spit out a Shakespearian soliloquy before he finally croaks. You can practically hear everybody in the theater thinking the same thing: ""Just die already!"" Before you check this movie off of you ""must-see"" list, however, take into account that despite the length, this movie is quite entertaining. The story of two competing magicians seems like it might be as dry as a bone, but the grudges that Alfred and Robert (Jackman) hold against each other are not just about pride; they are genuinely driven by heart and soul. It's easy to see how much these to guys hate each other, and don't worry about not knowing why, because you'll find out within the first half hour of the movie.

As far as performances go, not enough can ever be said about Michael Caine. His brilliance as an actor steals ever scene he's in. Jackman has probably had his best performance thus far in his career, except maybe for Swordfish. Bale is terrific as always, bringing every part of Alfred right into your face. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job, but her role was far too small, and at the end of the film you'll be wondering why her character, Olivia, wasn't explored a little more.

When you actually do go out and see the movie, a fit of confusion is going to come over you quickly, possibly lasting into the last 40 minutes. It's not the plot twists that will confuse you; those are pretty ambiguous, and many people will call them out before they are revealed. No, the way this movie hurts your brain is with its three time lines, which alternate between scenes. In the beginning, Robert is dead, and Alfred is going to prison. Then, all of a sudden, they are young, up-and-coming magicians. And before you know it, we're with Robert in Colorado, as he tries to find the secret behind Alfred's greatest magic trick. Sometimes, you will think that these time lines come in sync with each other, but I'll save you a lot of of confusion right here: they don't.",7

12 April 2007,A Cult Classic!!! Masterpiece Perfection!!!,"Let me start of with saying that I am a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolan. but even by his high standards, Prestige took me completely by surprise. having immensely enjoyed his Memento and Insomnia, I was expecting nothing short of such a path-breaking effort. But Prestige is a masterpiece. a once-in-a-lifetime movie. U may not see one like this again. And if you do, rest assured, it will be from Nolan.

The film is about the ever-lasting rivalry between two magicians. One,a gifted showman - the other, a true magician. The story is quite a simple one.It deals with various attempts by the two to outdo each other-by hook or crook. But what happens when one of them unveils the greatest magic trick ever? What could the other one possibly do to rival or out-perform such a great feat?!!! Watch The Prestige. And like u may well expect, Nolan doesn't go with any conventional narration techniques. He chooses his own cult method and the result is a deliciously twisted, dark, and dramatic tale that keeps you guessing until the end titles roll.

It is very important for a film like this to have good performances from the cast. I can say with conviction that Prestige has the most astonishingly powerful performances from all the actors involved and most certainly from its two male leads. Christian Bale does the role of Alfred Borden with at most conviction and ease. It just seems like a walk in the park for him. He is absolutely brilliant in a role with relatively less heroism when compared to his Batman outing with Nolan. Michael Caine once again proves he is the among the best in the business even at this age. He has a very significant role and you can trust Cine to deliver a stunning performance and he does. Scarlett Johanson brings the glamour quotient and doesn't really have much to do-but she does play her part well. But Hugh Jackman steals the show. It is without a shred of doubt the actor's best performance till date.He plays Robert Angier with supreme confidence and elegance and with the charm that is in born him. He is so good that you feel he was born to play Angier! The cinematography,costumes and make-up are brilliant. The movie captures the mood and look of Victorian London brilliantly.

Last-but-not-least the direction. No one, not even Tarantino or Spielberg could have done the movie better than Nolan. He has made an absolute spectacular movie which is as close to perfection as you could possibly get! An absolute must for everyone. Go grab the DVD now if you missed it in the theatres!!!

BRILLIANT!!!",10
6 October 2020,Another excellent film by Christopher Nolan,"This film explores the rivalry between two stage magicians in 19th century London. The initially friendly rivalry turns bitter and deadly when the wife of one of them dies on stage during a risky trick.

I liked this film due to its very high production values, the masterful direction of Christopher Nolan and his stellar cast of actors and actresses.

This is not the best Nolan though. It involves an element in the last trick that made it too unbelievable, desperate, and cruel to me.

24 October 2006,Prestigious.....Not!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",4
15 August 2014,"Of all of Christopher Nolan's amazing works, this is definitely my favorite.","I won't spoil much about this movie, it's a film that has to be seen to be believed.

Christopher Nolan is big in Hollywood right now. The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception have all turned him into one of the most successful directors today. Not to mention the initial boost he got from Following and Memento.

But of all his work, this is simply the darkest and the most well-made. The entire movie plays out like a magic trick.

This is my favorite Christopher Nolan, it's beat his Batman movies, Inception and Memento to it. Watch this right now. You won't regret it. Just remember to use your head and think, it's a movie as cerebral as Inception.

4 January 2014,Great movie with some flaws.,"First off, I want to say that when I was young, I used to visit circus a lot and a lot of events which showcased Magic Tricks, I was even enthralled and excited at such events being held at my school. I was also interested and learning Magic Tricks and showing them to my friends and parents. There is nothing to be ashamed about in this case, a lot of people watched Magic as kids. The basic premise of the Prestige is just perfect for my taste as it is about Magic Tricks and two Magicians.

When I first heard about the Prestige, i thought it was some kind of a wizard movie with real magic, People having a reason for flying and transporting simple for no real reason other than it's REAL MAGIC. Luckily when I did more research I was glad that it was actually more realistic and based on Magic Tricks.

This movie tells you about the life of Magicians back in the late 1800s, Magic meant everything to them they were obsessed with their tricks and they felt revealing their tricks would ruin them. Secrets were everything to them. The setting of the movie mind you in fantastic, the visuals, the areas, the clothes and even the *FUNNY* accents kind of suit the setting. A rivalry between two magicians which starts as a personal one turns more into a obsessive and professional one as one gets obsessed with the secret behind the other's trick and wants to prove he is the better magician.

The plot is very good overall, but the movie can and will get confusing because the timeline is not depicted well, when you are watching the Long Past, the recent past or the present, things will get confusing and there is not text guiding you to understand which year you are in. This will cause the viewer to mix things up and he will lose attention. The story would have greatly benefited from a chronological order or at least a proper descriptions of the years. The plot also starts out extremely slow and drags out till the rivalry actually starts.

Acting wise, the film is excellent, Hugh Jackman is awesome as Angier or the Great Danton, he is just natural in his acting, Christian Bale gives a great performance, many may find his character confusing and hard to understand at first but it will all come to ahead, his fake accent is not good though. Michael Caine is great and actually has a natural accent. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.

I also feel like that an addition of such a Sci-Fi dimension kind of hurt the movie, not only it is not exactly believable if the time period is taken into consideration a more logical explanation would have worked better. The secrets of Bale and Angier serve as the twists of the movie. Angier's was disappointing whereas Bale's was something I saw coming a few minutes before it took place. After a second watch it is laughable how many clues were there, perhaps more analytic and deep thinkers would have seen it coming a mile away, and I won't be surprised if they actually did. The twists are not exactly a strong suit.

The ending however had a good, clear and true message, we do not exactly always look for the secrets behind the tricks, because doing that ruins the trick and we won't want to see it anymore, that is exactly why the secrets are a magicians life. Few flaws aside prestige should see, any Nolan fan, Bale or Jackman, movie fans or even people who used to enjoy magic tricks at various shows should watch this great movie, few minor flaws aside, you are in for a great treat. Overall 8/10.",8
27 October 2016,You are so lucky if you haven't seen this movie,"People who haven't seen this movie yet are very lucky that they will get amazed when they watch this. I can easily say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The scenario is amazing. This is not a movie that you can watch over and over but in your life you must not die before watching it. On the other hand, before watching that movie I had so little information about Nicola Tesla. Before I only know that he is the father of magnetism and 1 Tesla = 10.000 Gauss from Physics :) . But in this movie we can see competition between Tesla and Edison , the working version of Tesla's prototypes. And the hard life of Tesla. I am sure most of the people googled Tesla after watching this movie. And the books about Tesla sold many copies after that movie.

22 October 2006,Greatest movie of the year!,"This is probably the best movie I have seen all year. The plot was so secretive and suspenseful that it kept me guessing the whole time i was watching it. The ending was some what of a mystery, and i still am not quite sure of what exactly took place, but the directors and writers of this movie definitely deserve an award.

The movie has two hidden morals, one that deals with the brutality of rivalry and one that deals with obsession. Obsession can sometimes lead to one's ultimate downfall. This theory is proved correct by the plot of this movie.

Towards the beginning of the movie, I believed that Angier was the protagonist and that Borden was the 'bad guy', but assumptions aren't always what they seem.

Other than it's complexities, I also thought that the movie helped the viewer gain some knowledge of the 'tricks behind the trick' having to do with magic. I'm not saying that what they portrayed as the secrets to some old magic tricks are real, but they kept me wondering ""what if..""

If you are not easily confused and can keep up with a fast-paced mystery, then go watch this movie as soon as you can!!",10

4 November 2006,really good movie,"one of the few movies I've seen in the past few years that completely captivates the audience. people aren't reaching for their cellphones of kissing their date but instead are holding their breath waiting for the next word. i had almost forgotten what a truly good movie can do to a room of people. from the first line of the movie you will be memorized by the mystery of it all. the cast is flawless along with directing. the plot is cunningly so constructed in such a way that is gives great satisfaction to the viewer. if gives enough hints for the sharpest of eye and will spin you in a one-eighty once you think you have figured it out. the minute you think that this is just another easier suspense movie, think again and make sure ""you're watching closely.""

21 October 2006,Great Movie Despite Surprisingly Average Acting,"After reading the plot, I knew I had to see this at the theater and all in all, I must say that I was not disappointed. Solid story well presented and edited in a way that ensures the viewer is constantly surprised and interested. The script is excellent and so is the basic storyline. Kudos to the Nolan brothers for delivering yet another masterpiece.

I agree with many other reviewers that this film deserves at least some kind of Oscar nomination, but I must criticize the movie for the very average acting demonstration of the two main characters. Jackman and Bale are both so-so in their roles, and this movie will not be remembered thanks to their performance. Johansson and Caine on the other hand are great as usual.

I highly recommend seeing this at the theaters and actually also buying it on DVD, though I believe that it will mostly be enjoyed by mature audiences (i.e. 21+): little violence or nudity here, but a very dark subject matter.

Hugh Jackman (Rupert Angier) - 5/10 - Not too impressed with his non-wolverine abilities.

Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) - 6/10 - Gave an eerie Batman-esquire feel to his character, which though can be argued to be in character felt inaccurate to me.

Michael Caine (Cutter) - 9/10 - Showing the young ones how it's done.

Rebecca Hall (Sarah) - 8/10 - Strong performance from this newcomer.

Scarlett Johansson (Olivia Wenscombe) - 8/10 - Strong performance, though by now, regulars should know that I am a big fan.

Christopher Nolan - 10/10 - Excellent work, once again.",
10 October 2019,Who knew?,"I was dragged to this movie back when it was in theaters. I had never seen a preview or even heard of it. Before my friends and I went through the theater doors I asked ""what's this movie about?"" One of my friends said ""it's about magic and it has David Bowie in it!"" I thought to myself..... so what? But oooo boy was my friend wrong! Literally they were right but the film is much more then that. No spoilers but wolverine and Batman are just fantastic together. And who knew Christopher Nolan made this?! I didn't realize this till years later. Go watch this movie!

3 April 2023,One of the Best. Movie. Ever. Made.,"I hate period movies. Not my thing.... BUT...

This is my favourite movie, I've seen it twice on the day when I first saw it. In the last 16 years I have seen it again countless times and it never gets broing, even knowing all the twists. There is always something else you can spot. This is imo Nolans BEST movie and unfortunately also the most underrated.

It is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 and ones you have seen it and as well read the script, you will understand why.

A modern Masterpiece, something every upcomming director OR writer shuld assess in detail and learn from. This is how cinema needs to be..

29 June 2023,We choose to be fooled.,"In fact, the ending is already faintly visible after the middle stage. It seems foreseeable that both sides will suffer, but the question is just what their ultimate magic will be presented in, and what sacrifices will be made. The emergence of the copying machine has brought the viewing of movies to a new level, and from the overall concept and initial metaphor, the emergence of the copying machine precisely reflects sacrifice and alienation to the most extreme extent. Behind every wonderful magic, there is a blatant murder - the murderer is himself, and the murderer is also himself. What is the one left behind thinking when the bone chilling climbs up his spine? The symbol of the machine age is socialized mass production, in which products are constrained by unified standards, and creators are also shackled by unified standards. It seems that this entire society is a huge copying machine. We face the same thing every day, think the same thing, eat the same fast food, kill ourselves, and create ourselves again. What have we sacrificed in the ""magic""? I don't think this film is purely entertainment. It may be because its tragic and dark tones evoke tragic memories of the early 20th century, or perhaps today's society is just an upgraded version of the Victorian era, with fundamental contradictions far from being resolved or even recognized, or we would rather turn a blind eye. Just like the last sentence in the movie: We choose to be fooled.",9
23 November 2006,Wowee!,"WHAT...A....GOOOD...MOVIE!!!! And WHAT...A...GOOD...CAST!!! And WHAT...A...GOOD...SCRIPT!! Oh and the directing rules too! Nolan is a god, how he could come up with such an elaborate story, make it into an understandable script and then make an amazningly directed film of it i just don't know.

It feels impossible to me. Hugh Jackman is no longer wolverine. I don not see him as just that anymore, so thats good. He was great in this. Christin Bale i could not stand in Batman Begins, but in this he was so engaging, making im look like a subtle villain.

The story is just so...wow! It never lost me or made me bored it was just...well go see it. And look oput for the twist!

10 April 2019,What makes a good magic trick?,"I like magic tricks. Even as a kid I knew they weren't real, but it didn't stop me from admiring the skill and the how-did-they-do-that moment right after the prestige, the final act of a magic trick. It's a kind of awe. But the success of a magic trick is based on the audience not understanding how what just happened, happened. Every magician knows this, which is why they're wary to reveal how a trick is done.

And that's the problem with The Prestige. The movie is about dueling magicians and is in itself a magic trick. There are twists, double-twists, surprise characters, we don't have all the pieces, or do we, no we don't, yes we do, another twist, and then the end happens -- and Christopher Nolan reveals how the whole narrative trick was constructed, step by step. It's as if a magician just did the most amazing trick you've ever seen and then spends the next ten minutes explaining how exactly he did it. It's disappointing, deflating. Instead of feeling wowed, we feel let down. We could talk about the other elements in the film, like the acting or directing or set design, but all these are subservient to the mystery, and in the end there is no mystery; had the ending been more ambiguous I would've rated this movie higher. I've seen every Nolan film, and this is the weakest by far.",5

23 July 2012,Were you watching closely?,"This movie is a masterpiece in the way that it tells a story. You know a movie is fantastic if it can give everything away within the first five minutes, and still manage to keep you guessing until the end, and that is exactly what this movie does. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote an amazing screenplay dealing with sacrifice, deception, intrigue, and fierce competition. Paired with Christopher Nolan's strong direction, this movie becomes quietly mysterious, and incredibly fascinating.

All you simply need to do is watch--except watch closely. Everything in this movie happens for a reason, and just about every line is extremely important. Seemingly small events impact the entire movement of the film, while larger one brood in the background and affect everything from the characters' actions to the way they deal with situations.

In this movie you must realize the importance of sacrifice, for each man is obsessed with having the best magic trick more than anything else, and therefore willing to give up pretty much anything in order to achieve this. Both of their lives are changed forever for one, seemingly simple trick which they both go about doing in different, equally as difficult ways.

The acting, too, is very good, especially Christian Bale, who is slowly tormented by his all- consuming trick, and Michael Caine, who has a change of heart after discovering the true motives of Hugh Jackman, whom he works for, and who is determined to seek revenge. Throughout the movie, they both lose so much, and yet they both stay on the track of deception and obsess over this one trick. The eerie, building music demonstrates their quest and journey towards fulfillment, and compliments the darker tones of the film.

Overall, if you are willing to think, this movie as a must-see. Just remember--watch closely, because, as Michael Caine says in the movie, ""making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.""",9

The Prestige deserves better. It deserves to be seen untainted. Don't read the reviews or discuss it with anyone... just go see it.

13 January 2020,Another genius film from the world's greatest filmmaker,"I only learned about this movie last week which is weird considering it's a quite critically acclaimed film from the world's best director. I watched it immediately, as one would, and it truly surprised me, such a fantastic film!

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are amazing actors, and they portray the characters' anger, joy and struggle with great skill. Michael Caine is also great in his role (as always), while Scarlett Johansson doesn't get much to do. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one, is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, and he actually portrays the character very well.

Unfortunately, the score is underwhelming and very forgettable and you truly notice the lack of Hans Zimmer' sound and music. The cinematography isn't remarkable but the scenes in the large theaters and some magic tricks are beautifully captured. The environment and feeling of the early 1900s is also captured very well and it is a perfect time period for the story.

What really shines about this movie is the ending, and how it perfectly and satisfyingly concludes the characters' arcs, while providing several brilliant plot twists that doesn't leave your mind for quite some time. On the contrary, I can't stop thinking about it, and the second the movie finished I wanted to see it again.

In conclusion, a wonderful film that has some weak parts but not weak enough to even leave a dent in my great impression of it. The ending is my favourite in a Nolan movie, and that is saying a lot considering the remarkable quality of his other films.",9
1 January 2007,The Names,"I don't know if this has been mentioned in any other post or not, but I was quite intrigued at the initials of the two protagonists - Alfred Borden (AB) and Robert Angier (RA). Abracadabra also happens to be the last word that Bale's character utters. I think Olivia summarized it beautifully when she said 'You two belong to each other'. Angier and Borden are in fact, two sides of the same coin. In fact, they are very much like the coin trick that Borden pulls on that young kid - two sides are the same. This aspect is emphasized by the fact that one gets shot in the hands, another hurts his leg, one a showman, the other the more talented magician. They actually complete each other.

28 November 2006,A dark and twisting snake of a film!,"The Prestige is an awesome film. The character development is done really well and I was drawn into the film despite being sceptical of it.

For me it was Christian Bale that stole the show. He favours the understated style of acting and understands that a lot of the time less is more. This makes for a believable and heart felt performance.

My favourite aspect of the film and part of its beauty is the way the film is been structured. The explanation at the beginning of the film of the three stages of a magic trick could also be applied to the plot. The following quote sums up how the film is created: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The Prestige has more than enough twists to keep you on edge and even though you know they're coming they're still clever.

For all the praise I can give there are few criticisms. Parts of the storyline don't quite seem to fit together. I found myself having to let a few faults and coincidences go in order to enjoy the film.

I particularly liked the three levels that the film operated on. As a simple film about two magicians feuding with a colourful storyline; as a drama that sucked the viewer in and made the characters problems and successes your own; and finally the level that makes this film stand out was the darker side to the film. A plot that reveals itself in the end as a sinister struggle full of death and treachery.

The Prestige is a must see so book your ticket now! : )",9
1 April 2007,Good film experience,"Enough positive comments have been made about this film BUT I didn't get the ending! Could someone tell me what happens at the VERY end: Who dies & who doesn't? Replies to salamu@iprimus.com.au appreciated.

I cannot think of any more to comment but I'm being asked to write 10 lines! So I hope this extra will be accepted! Does anyone else have this problem? Why can't we only write a few lines? Beats me.

Casting was good with Bale turning out the most impressive performance to date. Jackman not as impressive. Bale was the more contained & restrained. The brief appearance of ex-Gollum would have gone unnoticed had my husband not pointed it out, as with Bowie acting as Tesla, and a nice job he did too. Now that must be 10 lines surely!

29 January 2010,Absolutely amazing film,"In my opinion this is probably the greatest film I have ever seen, an awesome cast at the peak of their performances. Christian Bale is often referred to as a 'wooden' or 'emotionless' actor, but I blame this on the fact that for a great deal of his films he has to put on an American accent, but during his performance in this film he sticks to a British accent, it may not be his natural one, but it seems to open him up to new emotions that he cannot portray with an American accent. Hugh Jackman is also sometimes ridiculed for his acting, but for this film he doesn't play the mindless, anger-driven wolverine which I feel limited his acting performances, as all he had to do was flex his muscles and shout, but again, this film shows his true potential as an actor and it is truly astonishing. Michael Caine... Well there's nothing to say, you can't go wrong with Michael Caine. Scarlett Johanson, despite being a fairly minor character, was actually quite impressive, particularly with her accent which was spot on, though I felt her character was a bit pointless (other than to keep the gents happy obviously) but that would be a problem I have with the book itself rather than the film adaptation. All of these brilliant actors, each of which I would say providing the best performances of their careers so far, coupled with Christopher Nolan, a director who seems to be able to turn anything into an amazing film, make this film a truly amazing experience, and believe me, you will want to watch it again. 10/10 - my favourite film",10

26 January 2014,"Full throttled, Gripping and Leave you amused!","Without any doubt this movie comes in top 10 best movies I have ever watched in my lifetime till date and It will surely be for a coming long time. Nothing of this tale left you unsatisfied or bored at a single second. Truly a masterpiece to must have in one's video library. hats off to all the team! Human emotions represented at most vibrant colors and zest of passion of one's mad obsession. Another aspect which drives this movie more near to my heart is the Scientific historical facts used as baseline of story. Magic is not just a game but a way of life. I have watched it numerous times and still it keeps its freshness alive every time I repeat it. Christian bale has surely discovered his best acting career through this movie. Each and every character of this movie is just awesome!

21 October 2006,Worth the Wait,"Like the reviewer before me, I've been ready and waiting for this film from the moment I heard about it. The stars, all favorites of mine. The director, amazing. And the cherry on top--Bowie. Unlike my fellow reviewer, I was astounded and satisfied. Performances were top-notch all around, direction was masterful, and the script! Can we talk about the intricate, subtle, mind-bending way the story was constructed? Yes, it is a little on the challenging side, and that's what makes it great. Anything less would have been boring and predictable. But the writing here kept me guessing and led me in directions I sometimes wasn't prepared for. Like Memento, that other masterstroke from the brothers Nolan, the story lines intertwine in time, which always keeps the viewer wondering how the characters got to where (you think) you know they're going.

And then there was Bowie. He's been woefully absent from the big screen for too long, and this role was built for him. Seriously one of the best entrance scenes ever, and one only Bowie could pull off. Bale, as always, blows me away with his ability to fully inhabit his character. Jackman impresses again, though I don't know that I am surprised, since he has proved his talent time and again. Caine is an institution unto himself. Rebecca Hall rises beautifully to the task bringing the tortured wife(?) to life. And Johansson--amazing. She is learning more with every role and I can only look forward to a long and interesting career.

Run, don't walk to this one. And don't blink while you're there.",10
9 August 2010,Beautifully crafted film,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",10
15 January 2013,The Best Movie of 2006 and One of the Best in the whole film industry,"Sorry for the review, but I am not English so there are some mistakes I am sure. :) What I wrote in the summery is true in my opinion. It's sure that this is one of my favorite movie. I think that was the biggest fail of the year that the actors and the director got nothing in the Academy Awards. And I can't imagine which movie was better than this in 2006? Because 2006 was one of the worst year in the film industry in my opinion. I remember just for a few good movie. I recommend the movie for everybody who like to think and not just watching the explosions (which I like, but this movie is about something else). It wasn't long for me, I think this is the kind of movie what I would call ""a perfect one"". I don't think that everybody could write a better ""Prestige"" then this. The sound effects and the music created a very good and formidable atmosphere. Oh and my favorite character was Tesla like in science. He was really one of the best scientist who ever lived, maybe better then any one else, but I don't want a debate about this. These are just my opinion. 10/10 More movies like this!!!

20 October 2006,Another Gem from Nolan!,"I really loved this movie and can not even really think of anything else to compare it to. It's just so dark and edgy, it reminds me of a cross between early Tim Burton and David Fincher in its delivery. So mystical but still connected with reality and powerful. I think I'm still recovering...

The acting is excellent, Bale is solidifying himself as one of the best actors out there, Jackman's great, and I like the fact that Scarlett Johanssen's role in the film clearly was not expanded just because she signed on, her presence only adds to the film without trying to be bigger than the story.

I would highly recommend this movie and have to say that this movie, along with a few other recent releases (Science of Sleep, Departed, etc) is an encouraging sign of where the movie industry is headed...

24 November 2010,"Amazing, all I can say.10/10 !","This movie seems to get better every time I watch it, each little detail fits together so perfectly. It's impossible to fault, Nolan is a true genius. By far my favourite movie of all time,. Definitely deserves more than a sloppy 8.4 rating for such a magical piece, unfortunately it doesn't seem to take hold of everyone as strongly as it did me.

Firstly the genre of the movie fitted perfectly to my liking, the movie was coated with a dark atmosphere, & the twist revolving around Borden was by far the best I've ever seen in a movie, i found the measures he took for what he loves doing to be inspiring

If i had to pick one imperfection from the movie, It would be the machine made by Tesla, although i felt it added a special touch to the movie, I can see how some people would say it was just an easy way to end it.

22 November 2006,Excellent!,"The Prestige is a superb movie that tells the story of two rival magicians trying to outdo each others magic tricks, sometimes without mercy. It's visually brilliant, the tricks that are performed on screen are fantastic to watch. The acting is brilliant, ""Batman vs. Wolverine"", with Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman playing great lead roles and Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine playing really good supporting roles. But the story and plot, what the movie relies on, is fantastic. Plenty of twists and turns to keep you captivated and enough drama to keep you interested. Some of the twists are bit...well, odd, but otherwise, pretty flawless in its delivery.

Great movie, a must-see for 2006.

17 January 2022,Enjoyed the twists,Enjoyed all the twists of this Nolan film - it's his best film - never understood that awful film inception - but this is a spellbinding film about the explanations behind magic. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians with a life long rivalry bent on figuring out the other. Controversy rises when a female apprentice drowns in a tank in a trick that backfired. He previously made a farce of the Batman series in Batman Begins as well as directing the overrated thriller Memento. Here he examines the explanations and challenges of magic with tremendous sets and acts to overwhelm the mind. Jackman is excellent as an accomplished magician out to perfect the transporting act. Bale as the rival is married and has a daughter but spends much time in prison for murder. Scarlett Johansson plays an apprentice of Jackman's sent to achieve Bale's secrets. Finally there is Michael Caine who voices reason and the mystery behind it all. Rebecca Hall plays Bale's wife while Piper Perabo plays the wife of the Jackman character. Nolan is among the most intelligent of directors and seems confident in creating suspense as well as leave audiences guessing but the ending here may be questionable to some if not brilliantly vengeful.,7
21 October 2006,Beautiful!,"I saw flags of our fathers, what i consider to be a very mediocre film, but as far as the reviews have been going this past week, it's virtually the only film i knew had come out. I saw a preview for The prestige and decided to go, and I was so glad i did. Besides the flawless acting and triumphantly consistent tone, the movie strikes on you on a few different levels. It portrays all aspects of our lives in general-- our sacrifices and the prestige we sacrifice for. What are you willing to give up for greatness? GO SEE THIS FILM! I have not been satisfied by a film in so very long, although i recently saw the departed which was indeed a kickass film, but Nolan's style is so magnificent-- its totally encaptivating, and I just had so much fun at this movie.

15 August 2010,The Prestige is a Magical piece.,"The Prestige is a movie about two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Agnier (Hugh Jackman) work as apprentices to Cutter (Michael Caine). During their work for him, one of the tricks suffers a terrible accident and Agnier develops an obsession for being better than Borden. When Borden develops a trick that Agnier can't figure out, things continue to escalate until both men are at each others throats.

This movie is great. It plays with the time line and actually starts at the death of Robert Agnier. The viewpoint shifts between Borden and Agnier to keep you involved with both men, and while the movie goes through both men manage to become ambiguously protagonist and antagonist. The movie is a mystery, when the magicians develop tricks, you aren't told how they are doing their tricks right away. In a way, its like seeing a magic show while seeing the movie. The movie is filled with twists that keep you on the edge of your seat, though near the end it can seem like its getting dragged out a bit, you eventually catch up to the present events taking place and the actual ending to the story.

Even though this is a great movie, its not without its flaws. Near the start in particular, it was hard to tell what was going on exactly because of the non-linear time line that the movie uses to tell the story. You might be confused a little bit on the characters and what all is going on for a good part of the opening, but it clears up quick enough, and maybe its just me. There's also a bit of a problem with the female characters. The main female characters, Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall) and the stagehand secondary love interest (Scarlett Johanson), manage to garner attention and seem to be written to be really important to the plot of the movie. Unfortunately, this just isn't realized very well, and by the end of the movie its questionable if they even had to be there in the first place, or if they were just put on to the set to be eye candy.

Overall, The Prestige is a great movie, perfectly done and well performed. I haven't read the novel (yet) and therefore can't comment on how well it did with the source material, but from a basic movie stand point, it is very exciting, and a movie you should see, even if it doesn't take highest priority.

24 July 2007,An interesting story well told,"It attracts you at first because it treats a subject everyone likes: magic and its secrets. But then, from the start, you see the plot quickly thicken. Writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has already proved his brilliance with Memento, plays with the timing of the story yet again by skillfully shuffling four different periods in the storyline, and adds an exciting pace by revealing a new twist with every step, so you never get used to anything or bored. The performances are dead-on and the actors very well cast indeed. A little too long, but it pays to see it all through. You want to have some fun? Try to figure out what happens next. The movie will by far exceed your expectations. Very entertaining indeed.

By the way, Tesla existed in real life, though I seriously doubt he built all the things shown in the movie.

19 December 2011,probably the greatest movie i have ever seen,"the prestige is not only a movie as it is a masterpiece. apart from the acting, which extraordinary and amazing to watch, the plot and the way the story was built are the things which really stand out. firstly, it is not a movie for everyone as it requires some concentration and thinking. the plot is sophisticated in just a different way that is built by such a perfect manner, you wont see anything like it. the ending will leave you breathless and the final sentence will show you that this movie is the best. the only problem i face is that after watching this movie i could not see other movies as nothing can compare to this mesmerizing masterpiece/

2 March 2007,It takes 15 Min's to figure it out,"Do not be alarmed, this does NOT contain spoilers. If you are, like me, a fan of the BBC series Jonathan Creek (detective series where the technical adviser to magician Adam Klaus teams up with a reporter to solve murders using the same method that is behind the magic shows. The adviser is named Jonathan Creek, hence the title) , you will probably think you have to see this movie, but you really don't. It relies on the same logic and tricks as all movies and series about ""magic"" do, although this one has a plot-twist, which by the way, you can see coming if you know how movies usually present such things. I figured the entire movie out in a quarter of an hour, although there remained some blanks in the picture, so I enjoyed the first 1 1/2 hour, but I have to warn you that this movie is cruel with many people getting hurt in many different ways and it is NOT a feel-good movie. Hugh Jackman is brilliant, though, reminded me of Thimothy Dalton (well he calls himself the Great Danton, coincidence? Yes.) And I would give Hugh my Hero of this movie vote, as I believe he is the guy you feel for. That is also why this movie sucks: you can pick either character to be your ""hero"", because well I get the feeling that the editor and director did not really realize you should pick one. This movie shifts between the two lead magicians as bad-guy and hero, which can be fun, but it is not. I left this movie feeling rotten and so did my party. They didn't all get it as fast as I did, so you may be amazed yet. But I'd pick a better movie if I were you, although pickings are slim at this time of year... Or: see this movie and leave half an hour early. Trust me, you'll feel better without it.",4
26 October 2006,Disapponting,"If this were some re-make or slasher I would expect nothing . It is an original idea with a fine cast and wonderful sets and settings .Maybe the idea is too original ( maybe not ) . I don't want to give much away . I should have loved this movie ; I love magic ; Hugh Jackman is very David Copperfieldish (look and everything) this is a good thing to me ; I love Michael Caine his accomplishments are too numerous to even begin to mention except to say see the original ""Italian Job"" . This does have some interesting historical tidbits which may spark interest . There is I believe a moral to the story which may in the end be a redeeming characteristic ; but it is disjointed and feels that way . I could not recommend people spend their time or money on it .

12 November 2006,the genius of simplicity,"A self confessed movie fanatic, film connoisseur and independent film maker in the making, i have been an avid user of IMDb for as long as an internet connection has graced the back of my modest computer. Yet, never before have i been left so impressed by a film that i feel i absolutely must write a comment on these message boards.

This film is outstanding in every way possible. Nolan's direction, slick editing, superb casting and impeccable plot deserve no less than a standing ovation. I was left open mouthed, cemented to my cheap cinema seat, over the moon about the fact i had done my part and donated a portion of my struggling finances to such a well deserved cause.

The subject matter is a reflection of the film itself... magical. There surely can never be another film to tackle the subject so well. Any other film maker to even attempt period film about magic will be committing career suicide.

The ending... well, i really don't know what to say. The summary line at the top of this comment says it all. In short... Nolan has hit the nail on the f*****g head!!!!",10
23 January 2013,"Are you watching closely. Enigma, Cypher whatever you call it, its magnificent....","Movie Review

The Prestige Seemed to be enigmatic and twisting movie at the start, based on 'The Prestige' Novel of Christopher Priest, directed by Christopher Nolan, and leaves many clues beyond many scenes in a mind capturing way. ""The Prestige"" is a victorious movie among that of twisting ones. The main phrase of movie, ""Are you watching closely?"" in start have a little bit impact on the viewer's mind but at the end it stuns the viewer in way that he cannot come out of its spell soon.

In movie the word ""prestige"", reveals the most amazing part of any magic trick when the climax of curiosity of audience touches its peaks. Two youthful and passionate magicians working together turn instantly their friendship to Rivalry and segregate their ways one another due death of one's wife by mistake of other. Later the faulty magician, having a title of ""Professor"" has successful life, as he invents a new trick, ""The transported Man"", in which, on the stage, enters a magic box by instantly closing it and appearing from other box placed apart from first one. Jealous of all these things, the other magician, ""The Great Danton"", tries the same trick by using his double but Borden (Professor), ruins his show. Later, the ""Professor"", to save his assistant from Angier (Danton), suggests him to consult Tesla, by a plan. Tesla, a scientist, forbids Angier to do such task. But, on his insistence he builds a machine for Angier that he wants, but Tesla leaves. On the other hand, Borden's Life is full of stress due to his relation with former assistant of Angier, and his wife doubts him, that he doesn't love him as he loved earlier. The later, ""The great Danton"", performs a trick, ""Real transported man"", in which he disappears on the stage and in final step he instantly appears on the Roof. He becomes famous and his trick's popularity rises in the whole England. On the other hand, Borden's Wife commits suicide, his female assistant leaves her. Borden, the later tries to find the secret of Angier's trick but during trick in which Angier mysteriously drowns under the stage and dies Borden is sentenced to be hanged. But, before his death, a person Lord Cadlow, asks him to utter his secret of ""Transported man"" in owe to grow her young daughter. When Borden meets Codlow he stuns that Codlow is just the dead Angier. He the later, doesn't comprehend, he asks his assistant Fallon to look after his daughter. Falon says good-bye to Borden and then Borden is hanged. In the Last scene, When Lord Codlow, new Angier destroys the machine of Tesla, he is shot by Borden who was hanged, then the movie, Unveils its amazing story, Actually, Borden's trick was simple because he and his twin brother and same appearance Fallon (Assistant) perform it simultaneously, and they take turns; one goes in a box other appears from second. Angier in fact, has the machine creating duplicates; every night during performance one duplicate drowns, and mystery is that Angier even not know was he real one or that who drowned, he tried to trick Borden but unfortunately Fallon caught, Angier did this prove himself a better magician. Movie ends at the scene Borden greeting with her daughter, the earlier who was promised by his late uncle Fallon. Interesting thing is the double character of Borden, by Borden and his like brother Fallon, As they share their life with Sarah(Borden's wife) and Olivia (Female assistant). Angier is shown as a jealous man, in start ruining Borden's show in revenge of his life but later, he does everything in his rage. Borden, a nice showman but due to him his wife and mother dies. John Cutter, Angier's old male assistant, a gentle man, due to whose evidence Fallon the mistaken Borden dies. Olivia, female assistant of Angier, who shows propensity to Borden on urge of Angier to take Borden's secret. Fallon, mistaken Borden, dies for his brother, sacrifices many times, such sacrifices make him die. ""Are you watching closely"", is the thing that castes a spell on the spectator. Movie captures mind of a viewer and slowly moves in a twisting manner, but at the Borden and Angier's final meeting ends In a really magnificent unveiling manner. In such a manner that one watching this movie feels its effect for a long time. Conclusion is that, Movie is fantastic, though having many thongs un-explained but this is for viewers own minds' capability to create and look beneath the surface. Movie has many aspects that tell how a person becomes so selfish, in jealousy that he forgets his moral values too, even his loved ones. The curiosity sometimes proves to be lethal. And heeding much on un-important issues can make one suffer. Finally, Movie has an amazing end, and suggestion is that viewers must watch it . AR Bilal",9
25 January 2007,Were you watching closely?,"Because if you were, than this movie shouldn't have seemed that great in the end. I had high hopes for The Prestige. I thought to myself, if Nolan thinks this is important enough to be made before Batman Begins 2, than it should be good. Unfortunately, the film fails to be completely amazing as I thought it would be.

Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, it throws you right in the middle of Angier and Borden's rivalry. Yes, Jackman and Bale's acting is superb and convincing. Yes, the directing is nothing short of amazing. So, in that case, what was missing? Call me crazy, but this film was predictable. If you simply pay attention to the story, you can figure out the ending 10 minutes or so before it. That's OK by, but why did they have to reveal the twist at the very end, when everyone already understands everything? Did they actually think the story was THAT complex? Because it wasn't. Nolan gives us this big, breathtaking finally, thinking that we're idiots, who can't figure out what is so painfully obvious. Well, I'm sure he doesn't really think that we are idiots, but it sure looks like it.

In the way it was made, The Prestige really reminded me of Memento. Not that it's a bad thing, it's just that Memento worked on every level possible, but The Prestige just doesn't. It's like a step back from the brilliance that was Memento.

Otherwise, this film was marvelous. And thankfully, I'm not someone who hates an utterly brilliant film, just because the ending was too simple. I am more interested in the process, than the result. And this film is a perfect example of when the process is more tasteful than the result.

28 January 2014,The Prestige,"The film has a pace to it which is satisfying and enjoyable, and it is fast to take off. The complexities of the story are involved from the word go; as the film begins at a stage just moments from the conclusion, when characters have already been defined, and the plot fully explored. It then progresses to the past, and, narrated partially by a friend of the two magicians (Caine), the story of how the men came to be where they have just been shown to have ended up is told. Already, you have been privy to scenes which are, though not entirely understood by you (as the lead-up to these scenes has not yet been viewed); they are still pleasantly electric and exciting. As you start to see more of the past, and to know the characters and their stories, you begin to feel anxious for the future of these people, watching with the fervent hope that all will turn out as it should, but knowing from what you have already seen that this is not so. You are, in this way, captured by the story from the moment it begins - caught up in the suspense of a semi-revealed outcome and the lives and feelings of a multitude of characters. Such interlocking of the story continues throughout the entire film, as flashes of the present are coupled with those of the past, and the truth can only be yearned for.",9
7 July 2021,A blend of science fiction and magic,"This movie is about a rivalry between two magicians, it shows you how an unhealthy obsession can make you lose everything.

What I love about this movie is that Nolan creates the movie as a magic trick, the trick itself is simple and very obvious but you don't want to believe it you want something more.

BUT don't view it as a period movie because it has a science fiction element that I don't want to spoil.

20 November 2006,Nolan deceives and delights once again.,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

15 December 2015,Bad in every way.,"The film starts with ridiculous rumbling noises drowning the natural sounds, in a pathetic attempt to create atmosphere. It then proceeds with actors mumbling their lines so it is hard to tell what is going on.

Then we have a rapid series of flashbacks, which are sprung on us suddenly, and sometimes it is not immediately apparent that we are watching a flashback or merely a change of scene.

As a result of all this it is very hard to follow the plot, and it is not helped by the fact that two of the main actors are very similar in appearance.

At the end, we discover that it is a Science Fiction film!

I find it hard to see why so many people rated it so highly, it is badly acted, confusing, and I did not find it entertaining.",1

31 May 2012,One of those movies that gets better every time that you see it,"The first time through, The Prestige is just a sort of intriguing film to watch, where the pageantry of the magic shows is about half of the attraction. When an implausible sci-fi twist comes along and makes the last half hour a great big WTF experience, it can be kind of disappointing. But if you watch it again, you'll see a lot more in it. This isn't just a movie about magic and figuring out how Robert Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) perform their greatest tricks. This is a story about the self-destructive nature of obsession and revenge, and about how you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. The second time through this movie, with a bit of perspective on what it all means, it gets better. You realize the massive sacrifices that Borden and Angier will make in an endless attempt to one-up one another.

From the beginning, the movie does a great job of setting up Borden and Angier as rivals. Borden is great at the technical aspects of being an illusionist, but he has no charisma or style. Angier, on the other hand, understands the ""show"" part of show business much better. It is almost painful to watch Borden perform his show with no personality in front of small crowds, while Angier dazzles much larger audiences with charm and pizazz. At some point though, Angier discovers that Borden has come up with a new magic trick. He becomes obsessed with finding out how Borden is doing the trick, resorting to extreme measures before finally coming up with his own version of it. From there, the feud continues to escalate. To say that this movie is wholly unpredictable would be putting it lightly. From the beginning, you never have a really good idea of where it is going or whether there is a formula at work. The last half hour will definitely surprise you. It might not satisfy you, but you won't see it coming.

The Prestige is strong evidence that the quality of a Christopher Nolan film is inversely proportional to its funding. Lacking the $100+ Million CGI budget of a film like Inception, Nolan focuses more in this movie on script and atmosphere. There are about a half dozen magic show scenes in this movie, and every one of them is a treat to watch. Unlike the loud (and sometimes obnoxious) Hans Zimmer scores that have populated Nolan's last couple of movies, The Prestige has a low key score, much more in the style of Memento.

The big drawback that I see to this film is that in typical Nolan fashion, the time line bounces around, to the point where the movie can be confusing the first time that you see it. Unlike Batman Begins and Memento, however, it's kind of pointless here. I can see no reason why this movie wouldn't have been better if it had been shown in chronological order. The film is complex enough as it is. It kind of hints that it is an allegory for the bitter feud between Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison, which occurred during this time period. It is one of those movies where you will probably notice something new every time that you see it, even after five viewings.

If you haven't seen The Prestige, then I highly encourage you to see it. If you saw it and you weren't very impressed, then I highly encourage you to give it a second chance. I enjoyed the movie on my first viewing, and it gets better every time that I see it.",8

3 April 2015,amazing,"in the beginning, i was thinking: this movie is totally overrated. its not even that interesting. but it captures the true nature of what movies were supposed to be in the first place. most movies today have an intense, climactic ending, while this movie just keeps picking up speed, becoming more interesting as the plot delves deeper and darker and even though one can't seem to grapple which character they support, you'll love this movie and its mind blowing ending. some people say its hard to understand. its really not. if you just pay attention, then you will completely understand it, even though the various jumping around between the years will be confusing. the plot of this requires geniuses at the same level as those of the dark knight. i only have one grievance: if they made this movie today it would've been slightly better because i feel that both hugh jackman and scarlett johansson's acting has developed and become a lot better over the last nine years. also, its not the type of movie you can watch again soon. if you wait a couple years then you'll feel the hype again.

31 October 2006,Absolutely Wonderful!,"The best kinds of movies are movies that will make you think and that you'll continue to talk about even after the picture ends, I went with my family and we talked about the movie even days after it ended, We're definitely going to go and see it again, it's a complete delight and will keep you on the edge of your seat even though it's a very long movie. There are so many plot twists and it will keep your mind spinning long after you finish watching it again, and once you see it you'll want to see it over and over again. I had no idea that this was previously a book and now I'm desperate to read it. Bale, Jackman and Johansen are wonderful actors and did a speldid job with their characters, giving them depth and three dimentions you'll have trouble deciding who to root for!

21 October 2012,Magic Tricks no problem,"To watch a film you must have three elements with you 1. Always pay attention to what's happening on screen 2.Pay attention to the plot elements 3.Make sure you take these elements with you when watching the prestige.

Yes its not hard to tell that the Prestige is probably one of the most complicated movies out there and keeps you asking what's happening,sure its hard to understand but its a very exciting movie and even though I had to go to the toilet for the last half hour of the film I just couldn't miss a single minute.

We all love Christopher Nolan but if your one of those who have a short attention span this film is not for you. But for the rest of you this is just Nolan at his finest and who is the better magician? Though you may be left wondering at the end even if you've payed the closest amount of attention it still would be a classic(and that's what you call a great film)

Don't expect this film to be understandable because its not and you'll probably enjoy it no matter the age limit for kids would enjoy the magic tricks and us older men would enjoy it for the questions it asks and keeping us on the very edge of our seat for 2 hours(now thats what you call talent)The film is a bit slow (films 2 hours 10 mins long)for some parts and the questions are very hard to solve so it becomes an 8 1/2 out of 10",8

7 March 2007,Poor sound quality,"Watched this via DVD...and the sound was poor, sometimes low and hard to hear, then normal..near the end the music seemed to be drowning out the conversations... I thought Michael Caine was good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale do a credible job, but not stellar. David Bowie in a small role is good. The sets are incredible, and the snow scene with the lights is a wow...it would be nice to see such a light show in real-life during the Christmas Holidays. Still the movie is slow at times, and yet, still isn't too bad--not great, but acceptable. This isn't a great movie (far from it, OK, way from from it), and at 130 minutes does seem long. I thought the story was good, the dialogue passable---when it could be heard. I don't know if others have noticed this, but it did distract from the movie. Quality of sound should be standard, but in this one, I felt it really go to be annoying at times, as I had to constantly adjust the volume up, down, up,down.

Movie plot wasn't bad and acting was decent..just poor sound production.",4
23 March 2007,Dud!,"Yes, I was pretty excited to go and see The Prestige. Supposedly brilliant twists and an ingenious puzzle...directed by the man who brought us Memento. Well, all the pieces of the puzzle were laid out quickly to the audience and not to far in the two main twists presented themselves too. After that clues were forced down our throats until I started to believe there had to be a third, more brilliant twist to the story. It never presented itself though. Shame on you Mr. Nolan! The acting is pretty good, the film looks good, but I still felt robbed at the end. Do go see it though if you usually aren't able to predict the twist. It will leave you feeling really smart.

26 June 2013,Amazing twists & turns - mind blowing!,"This is one of those films that i ended up encouraging family and friends to watch... a must see in my opinion. Christian Bale did an amazing job as did Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman. Christopher Nolan directed this and id say without a doubt this is his best movie by a mile!

2 magicians at war trying to discover each others tricks which quickly becomes an obsession rather then rivalry. The more they obsess about trying to better the other one the story gets darker what unfolds before our eyes is amazing. The ending of this film made me want to watch the whole thing again and on doing so you see so many things you didn't pick up on the first time around. Don't hesitate to watch this and pay attention whilst doing so. A few friends of mine have watched it and don't seem as crazy about it as me but when we discuss the plot its clear that they didn't pay real attention to the full dialogue going on. You can get lost if you miss vital parts of this story so make sure you watch it with your eyes and ears wide open!

16 November 2006,Implausible story,"The ""ultimate magic trick"" mentioned in the plot outline on IMDb involves such an unbelievable and unlikely happening that it conflicts with other thematic elements, and leaves one wondering whether this is a science fiction movie or a period movie about magicians. The whole plot is contrived. The movie is not compelling as a whole, only in parts. The acting is fine, but the dialog is often hard to follow--lines spoken too quickly and not distinctly. Don't expect a bright and sunny movie either--most scenes are filmed in dark and dingy sets. The movie starts out alright--two magicians competing for the best trick, but soon the plot devolves into a series of events where each main character seeks the ""ultimate magic trick."" Don't be fooled: this so-called ""ultimate magic trick"" is completely implausible, so the movie looses credibility and believability. If the movie had developed this part of the plot with more emphasis and detail it might have made for a more interesting movie, but as it is, the movie doesn't know if it wants to be a serious drama or a science fiction thriller.

1 June 2021,Christopher Nolan's Futuristic Way of Storytelling at it's BEST,"One event happens, then another, then another event happens that let you interpret the first event in a different way, then the same thing happens to the other event, wait what? That is basically what Nolan's masterpiece The Prestige is about. It gives you a perspective of two magicians who were friends at first, but then become rivals. You can support one, or another, but you don't need to support them, you can just watch them go CRAZY. The Prestige is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece. The acting is great with Hugh Jackman and Scarlet Johansson new to the Nolan-Verse. When Christian Bale and Michael Caine return from Batman Begins. I love the direction which shows you how a wonderful childhood experience that is magic, can be full of selfishness. If you ask me, I think Hugh Jackman's character is a better person, but in this case, I think Bale is right although I don't really love either of those characters because they are not designed to be loved. I also love the cameo appearance from the charismatic David Bowie. He acted great and played such a strong character. This is a must-watch for any film fan and I would recommend it to everyone.

28 July 2008,One rabbit short of a hat trick,"I think most of the reviews here cover the finer points of this film. Yes, it's a terrific story, with a fantastic cast, with Christian Bale once again giving a flawless performance. Yes, the direction is superb, and further confirms Christopher Nolan as a master of his art. Yes, it's a great film, and well worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.

However, two things bugged me about it, which I feel compelled to warn others about. The first problem was Scarlett Johansson. I don't particularly rate her as an actress anyway, but here she's really bad. How other people can suggest she gives a solid performance must surely mean 'solid' as in 'stiff' (as in 'wooden'). Yes, she's pretty, but she's also pretty unconvincing and her English accent, while an admirable attempt, still falls some way short.

The other thing that threatened to spoil my enjoyment of The Prestige was the utterly bizarre decision to cast David Bowie as Nicolas Tesla. At the best of times, he's a mediocre actor. On a positive note, this was one of those times, so he was at the top of his game, in a sense. Sadly, when he's on form, he's still crap, and his accent was nothing short of hilarious. I'm not sure what it was meant to be, but it sounded like the voice Ricky Gervais does at the start of his 'Animals' show - a kind of weird French, German, via North London affair.

There was one other thing that bothered me, which is the stuff about Hugh Jackman's 'machine'. It's totally ridiculous and doesn't fit with the tone of the film at all. I won't say any more than that, as I don't want to add any spoilers.

In spite of these issues though, the rest of The Prestige is so good it's easily worth eight out of ten.",8

17 August 2007,wolverine + batman = one damn movie,"sacrifices must be made to achieve the highest level of success. The main reason for me to see this movie was Hugh Jackman. The combination between wolverine and batman stars produces intense competition to in order to produce the greatest magic known to man. not recommended for young children. the climax is confusing and it was only through a friend that i understood it. This movie proves that magic is no less than a competitive sport to gain favor from the audience. A thriller/suspense movie with good performances especially Christian bale.Its pretty fun to know what a magician's life would be , may even inspire us to learn a few tricks.

16 November 2006,Great Acting & Storyline - Definitely worth watching,"I had long been looking forward for this Movie to come out, and I was not disappointed. Right from the opening scene it caught my attention, and it kept it for the duration of the movie.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale had great performances, and throughout the story I could almost feel the rivalry between them. I enjoyed the way the movie was set out with the mixture of flashbacks and diary entries.

I was left at the end of the movie thinking 'Wow'. Although sometimes I think movies can go overboard with the twists and turns, 'The Prestige' has just the right amount to be understood without watching the movie a second time, but enough to leave you wondering on many occasions.

Definitely Worth Seeing - It was one of the better movies to be release in a slow year.",9
20 May 2020,Waiting for the magic to happen.,"A friend loaned the DVD of this movie. I knew nothing about it. I had no preconceptions, just put it in the DVD player and pressed play.

I watched and waited. I waited for something to happen. I waited for a character that I could root for, someone I could relate to....it didn't happen. Every character in this movie is flawed...and having no characters that I care about just begs the question - 'why should I care about this movie?'

I do admit some strengths: It has very good production values, the settings were meticulously recreated for the period...I actually felt as if it was 1897. Great cast, Christian Bale always delivers, and the direction was taut. I am not saying it is a bad movie, just not my preference.

The entire film is telegraphed to the viewer in the first act. To continue watching is an exercise in patience. Every character seemed to garner contempt. The two warring magicians were conniving and murderous. The two female characters were thinly drawn and come across as rather intelligence-challenged. Michael Caine and David Bowie's characters were ethics-challenged to say the least.

Alas, the only real magic to The Prestige is that it made my respect for Christopher Nolan disappear. We shall see if ""Tenet"" can evoke the prestige of the trick.",3
31 January 2021,Nice but not too complicated.,"I love Christopher Nolan's movies. This one is also great and like every Film of him a masterpiece. The story is absolutely great and the spectator has to be concentrated. But it's not as complicated as interstellar, memento or tenet. And I knew the plot twist approximately after the half of the film meanwhile in movies like Memento you get it not until the very end.

24 October 2006,To all the Haters and Skeptics out there,"This movie is Amazing! and to all of the people out there who say it ""didn't live up to the expectations."" Get a Life! If you expect a perfect movie, you are going to live your whole life being disappointed. Just accept a movie for being great. I gave this movie a ten, there are probably 20-30 movies i would give a ten. 10 doesn't mean that this movie is better than any movie out there, it just means it is great...as it was. Christan Bale and Hugh Jackman along with Sir Michael Cane all gave phenomenal performances, this movie had me and every one i have talked to at the edge of our seats the entire movie. So to all the movie fans out there Thanks for letting me blow off some steam, and go see the Prestige, it will leave you breathless.

28 May 2013,My favorite movie for a reason,"People tend to react really hyped when it comes to movies they really enjoyed. We leave the movie theater and compare stuff we liked, which impressed us and stuff which we didn't. 7 years have passed since I watched ""The Prestige"" for the first time and although I must have watched the movie for several times now, I never feel totally ""in control"" over my emotions. The central question about ethical behavior around which this movie has been built never seems to be as clear or as easy to answer as the ones all the other movies I have watched have presented to me. The Prestige is build like a ""magic trick"" which consists of three acts itself (genius: The official Trailer tells you more than you could have known). The plot is told from different times and from different angles so that you never really know what is going on till the end. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is good way to tell a story, but Christopher Nolan has perfected this way of telling a plot since Memento. There will be times when you will think that you know exactly what is going on or you know what this movie is about but believe me: You don't. I don't want to spoil anything but if you like any sort of medium that really challenges your mind, you need to do yourself the favor and watch this movie. ""ABRACADABRA!""",10

29 August 2013,impressive battle between two men through a forgotten art,"The Prestige, I have to say, Mr. Nolan is close to my favorite filmmaker. Not only because he made superhero movies great films, but this man is also talented in other screenplays. For this one, for example, I'm not sure is it's his brother who got the idea, but the plot of two magicians engaging a battle for love and attacking each other by magic tricks is simply genius. Who the hell thought about that before, seriously? Great actor performances, stunning hot Scarlett Johansson and plus, he succeeds by making this film in another time of history and get appropriate costumes and landscapes. I think that this fact is a huge plus to any movie, whatever the subject is. It's pretty funny to see Hugh Jackman, who is the Wolverine, playing a total different kind of role, but it's nice to see also that he is a great actor even outside x-men movies, and for Bale, he is definitely getting a bigger place in my esteem for him and I think he is also a great actor. And oh God, the climax is so amazing! I'm not gonna say anything about it but I'm just gonna say that I almost jump of my couch when I saw it. Chris Nolan is definitely the man of modern films, keep making good stuff, I salute you.",10
23 October 2006,awesome movie,"This is an awesome movie, with non stop suspense that will keep you guessing to the very end. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackaman have really out done them selves in this movie. The day that this movie comes out on DVD it will be mine. Once you think you have the whole movie figured out, it will pull a 180 and totally fool you. The director does a great job of keeping the suspense intense through out the whole movie. He also does a nice job on flashing back to past and present to not confuse the audience. I loved how when you saw the future and you noticed something odd about the character that wasn't shown in the past. It foreshadows something on its way to come that you keep looking for. If you have 10$ maybe even 20$ that you want to spend I would definitely go see this one.

23 September 2008,"An entertaining movie. If you like a little illusion and a good twist, you'll enjoy this.","An entertaining movie. The first half only became truly interesting after you were already into the second half, but over all a movie definitely worth seeing. The acting was excellent, Bale and Jackman are marvelous rivals who are different enough, opposite enough, to make you root for one and then the other in the blink of an eye. The effects were very entertaining as was the 'magic'. There was just enough hinting at 'something more' to keep you guessing the entire time, which makes it a lot of fun to watch. And even if you didn't like anything else about this movie, the ending alone was reason enough to watch it. Amazing.

If you like a little illusion and a good twist, you'll enjoy this.

23 October 2006,Comme ce comme ca (so-so),"This movie is not bad. This movie is not good. The costumes are great, the movie stars beautiful (it was worth $5 for a matinée glimpse of Jackman without his shirt on), the acting superb (I mean..Michael Caine; it doesn't get any better than that).

But the plot is convoluted and hard to follow. It jumps back and forth, with the audience finding themselves trying to place whether this is in the past, the present, or the future. It also assumes the audience will relate to an obsession of the sort detailed in this movie. I didn't.

The movie was interesting, well worth the reduced matinée price of a movie, and the actors rose to their peak levels for a movie of this sort. But ultimately, it seemed to me that a group of suits sat around a table, made a list of some movie star names, and said, ""What movie can we create to have all these guys in the same movie and really pack the audience in?"" They ended up with a movie created for these performers, rather than a great movie, the cast for which was pulled from a list of excellent actors.

How it would have been better: A better script, tighter, shorter, a bit less convoluted. Photography - there were far too many extreme closeup shots. It would have been better if they had made some of those extreme closeups more full body or upper body shots, so that the audience could see the body language and maybe the other person the actor was communicating with. Not that there weren't great extreme closeups. And not that I mind seeing Hugh Jackman's eyes in closeup. It's just that there were too many such shots.

I expected more from Bale, Jackman, and Caine. Like I said, it was good, not bad. But I would've thought that these three powerweights of Hollywood could have commanded an excellent script and an award winning movie. They didn't hit it with this one.",5

8 November 2010,A magic trick in itself,"This twisted, cleverly plotted movie is a favorite of mine. The movie progresses like a magic trick which as you're told at the very outset by veteran genius Michael Caine's character has three parts: The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. Analyze the movie after watching it and you can identify how well it fits into this description. Everything unfolds in front of your eyes but you still didn't watch while Nolan amazes you with a new trick from his seemingly inexhaustible bag of tricks. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the obsessed magician roles perfectly while the cinematography and terrific production values set this mystery drama in Victorian London. One can uncover a few plot flaws on re-watch but that is because you know the secret. Once you know the secret, the magic is nothing.

21 October 2006,Most Triumphant,"This movie will thrill you till the end. All of the twists and turns keep you on your toes. This is the one and only movie that the second it was over I wanted to see it again! To all those people that like sequels and second chapters in movies, screw that. If there was to be a sequel it would ruin the entire elusiveness of the film. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very powerful performances. Suffice to say it was Bale's best performance on screen period.

It isn't for everyone some may get lost in the flashbacks and when the director delves deep into the minds of the characters.

Christopher Nolan is one special director I would call him the Steven Spielberg of our time. No joke you will want to see this movie again and again. If you see one movie this year make it The Prestige.

31 July 2017,A Magical Experience,"Set in a dark and malice late-Victorian England, The Prestige is a diabolical and intriguing thriller film by one of the most critically acclaimed director of our era, Christopher Nolan, about two stage magicians engaged in a competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion. This competition leads to sinister proceedings that moves both the story and audience to an ambivalent and ominous state. It's a tale of obsession and deception, a magic trick that creates a lasting impression.

The movie follows a solid story structure that made all the acts propulsive and fast-paced. Nolan's mastery of cinematic deception and visual illusions enables the film to proceed in a non-chronological yet understandable sequence. The changing of time and space between each cut makes the story engaging and entertaining to watch. The puzzles and tricks that were utilized makes the audience be part of the problem-solving in each scene, and although the answers are right in front of our eyes, Nolan still managed to hide them in plain sight, and were only revealed at the very last moment.

The characters in the story are lovable, relatable, human, and well- developed. The performance of the actors gave justice to their characters. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the two magicians propelled the rivalry of their respective characters to a grander height that helped on amplifying the overall emotion that drives the story forward.

Cinematography wise, the film is indeed magical. The utilization of visual illusions and tricks through editing reflected the theme of the story, which is deception. The use of parallax effects made each act more watchable. The overall lighting and music throughout the film created a dark and gloomy ambiance which made the movie overall, a more thrilling experience.

The Prestige tells the story of humanity's obsession and greed for power through two magicians who are willing to take all means necessary to top the other. It's a tale of demise amplified by suspense, deceit, compulsion, and avarice. It's an intelligent and cerebral film that is easy to understand when you watch it carefully. The amount of its rewatchability which is kind of rare on today's films makes each viewing a different and delightful experience. This is a film I would recommend to everyone especially to those who enjoy thriller films that is full of puzzles. The story of The Prestige is already commendable to its roots but if we look carefully towards its lessons, we will realize how rewarding this film really is. As said in the movie, we know the truth but we want to be fooled because of our desire to be amazed. Learning the truth however doesn't kill the magic, but brings the magic within us.

29 October 2006,The Best Movie of 2006!!!,"I loved this amazing movie! The basic plot concerns two magicians with an intense rivalry that becomes so intense that they begin doing horrible things just to out-do each other.

There are many twists and turns in the film and the film stays consistently interesting. There are many thrills and a lot of mystery in the film also to keep you guessing! You must pay close attention to the film, for if you miss one scene then you're likely to not have a clue what's going one. But the movie is extremely entertaining, so it is unlikely you'll want to miss anything! This is a very fantastic film, and sci-fi fans, mystery fans, and just about everyone else will love it! There are many shocking twists in it that the audience was gasping and ""ooh""-ing at when I went to see it! This is a great movie, and so far, the best movie of 2006! I give this one a 10 out of 10.

26 October 2006,This is the first movie I saw twice in three days. Loved it!,"The Prestige is seriously the best movie I've ever seen! Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Rebecca Hall did GREAT acting, however, Christian Bale should win BEST ACTOR! I've enjoyed his performances in previous films like American Psycho and The Machinist, but he deserves special recognition for his role in this movie. If you don't see this film,you are missing out on a great story, with great actors, and an awesome directing job by Christopher Nolan. I was pleasantly surprised to see David Bowie and Andy Serkis in the film and they played their roles PERFECTLY. Michael Cain adds a great deal to the stability and credibility to the main characters and as always does a fine job acting. This is certainly a MUST SEE!

2 January 2007,Human condition,"This is truly an movie of the human condition. I will not waste time here confirming what is truth: the movie was brilliant. There are many reasons why: screenplay, actors, cinematography, theme. In a word: clever use of story-telling with top notch actors. Many of the other movie-goers didn't take their eyes off the screen the entire time the movie played and even after it was over. It cannot be compared to the other gem, The Illusionist, however. Christian Bale is a force to be reckoned with (has this guy ever been horrible in a movie yet?!) and Wolverine sheds his paws and grows the heart of robbed man. Love, Loss, Obsession, Power, and Surprise! A terrific movie that I will buy and have at my side once available. Watch the movie...better yet, let the movie show you a trick...

23 October 2006,Very good but ending lacked the dramatic impact that it might have,"First the really good stuff - great style, sets, costumes, acting, etc. A very good period type piece and solid cast all the way around.

The only real weakness were a few of Nolan's decisions on the cutting room floor. A key ""surprise"" ending was perfectly obvious with 15+ minutes remaining. There was certainly no cascade of gasps in our theater as per Six Sense. A tragic weakness, as this film could have easy have been a 10 all the way around. Nolan could have accomplished the ultimate surprise ending that was horrifying and hit us with a huge ""oh my god"" but didn't.

I suspect that he simply underestimated the audience, that we would be too dumb to ""get it"" if he didn't fill in all the blanks ... and much too soon. Assuming that he did wish to ensure that the audience wouldn't miss the point, he could have had a little extra dialog between Angier and Borden at the end, and a little pan around with one of those awesome lanterns.

If you MUST assume that the audience is stupid, and needs all the pieces - then give them to us AFTER the reveal or DURING the reveal, not way way before.

Anyway, in most respects I did truly enjoy the movie and am glad to have seen it in the theater - it needs the big screen! But, yes, I feel left down as Nolan could have knocked this one out of the park. So, I won't go to the theater again but will definitely watch it again someday on DVD or Dish etc. Perhaps via a directors cut DVD we might see what this movie should have been.",8
4 April 2020,"So Much Darker Than The Illusionist, One Of My Favourite Films 😊","Whilst many appear to prefer The Illusionist, for me The Prestige provides a far deeper and darker exploration into the bitter rivalry between two magicians. The depths to which Bale and Jackman's characters stoop to exact revenge on one another whilst attempting to uncover each others secret results in a spectacular tale of intrigue, betrayal and murder. An encapsulating spectacle of cinematography which is deserving of much greater critical acclaim than it ever received.

26 August 2022,92/100,"The Prestige is an excellent movie no doubt about it. The production design - the sets, the costumes, the magic, especially the magic - was superb, and the cast did their jobs masterfully. But what really matters in this movie (and I guess it *is* tied in to the acting) is the characters and plot. I became deeply invested in each of the characters, and as for the main duo in specific, I couldn't decide whether to love or hate them, but that I felt the need to do so speaks volumes in of itself. The plot was also excellent, twisting and turning and flowing - until the very end, to explain I'll use an analogy from the movie: the big reveal at the end was like a magic trick the trick of which has been revealed, it loses its appeal, but the problem is that a movie isn't a magic trick, a movie must be able to reveal its secrets, and be all the better for it, and to a certain level, I think that's where The Prestige fails a little.

14 June 2020,The Prestige,"Nolan's films give the people who want to learn the theory and write the script a confidence, because Nolan's strong point is not so much the complexity of editing, but rather his ingenious combination of Lacan's concept of seeing and film narrative. Everyone is watching the movie, but they can't see anything because they don't care about the truth at all.

31 October 2006,"Even if you figure it out before the end, it's still fun to watch.","Without the knowledge that the director is trying to deceive the audience, you wouldn't have the large contingent of people saying ""I figured it out, so it's not worth watching."" I figured out the ending of this movie before the movie ended. Well, I figured out most of it; there are a few twists and turns that you pretty much can't predict. The beauty of this movie is that, even when you've figured it out (and you might, if you try, but where's the fun in that?), watching two dudes be completely obsessed with a competition--and with revenge--remains compelling.

Other complaints--that the characters are cold--gets at the very nature of obsession. One of the many brilliant facets of this movie: three-dimensional characters Become one-dimensional as they are consumed by their obsession.

In summary, holy crap this movie was awesome.

And most of all: you can find this ability even in the first frame you see. Is well direct and building a really good movie. Deep on the personal character journey of Bale and Jackman, you can find a lot of humanity.

17 September 2016,Review on movie,"One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time. The movie was well acted, interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and the twist at the end was surprising. The Prestige definitely is one of the best movies about magicians. I found out about this movie on flickstree and flickstree is really good and helpful in finding movies of our choice.

It keep me guessing and second guessing myself if was wonderful. I loved all the twist and turns and that it made me actually think. I had a good discussion with my friends for a half an hour after just to get what what really happened and we are still not sure if we are right. The movie follows the 3 parts of a magic act. The pledge, at first you think you know whats going on and it seems normal enough but then you get to the second part the turn, here the ordinary become something spectacular and the prestige were you look for the secret but wont find it. They did a wonderful job of incorporating this into the movie and making the movie its self almost a magic act. If you don't like to think this probably isn't the movie for you.

The movie is 2 hours, which isn't a bad thing, except for the way the directors seemed to just stretch and stretch the storyline as far as it can possibly go. The story is somewhat hard to understand, because it will sort of flash from the past to the present and you sort of lose track if your not watching closely. I was expecting much more from this movie, so don't get your hopes up too high, especially if your expecting a non-stop thriller. Okay so overall a pretty decent movie, interesting storyline, but hard to understand a lot of the time unless your watching closely.

29 October 2006,"Even if you know the ""big"" trick, it's worth watching","Spoilers follow

Unfortunately I had seen a new Outer Limits episode (nothing about magicians) that was very relevant about sacrifice and moral choices inherent in the science employed. Nolan offered clues very early (depiction of the reason for the trial, Caine's comments about the sailor, and Jackman walking past the hats on his first trek up the hill)combined with the OL episode, on the secret. The more interesting parts were how each man sacrificed along the way, not trying to hurt anyone but themselves, and leaving a lot of damage in their wake.

Is there a disconnect between Caine's supposed knowledge of the trick, demonstrated to the judge, and his decision near the end? Surely the visiting judge did not take at face value that the machine just ""worked.""",8

7 November 2006,I guess I expected too much,"I loved the actors in this move. I also love the director. I was, unfortunately, tainted I fear by my viewing of THE ILLUSIONIST, which was a clearly a better film in my opinion. I mention THE ILLUSIONIST for only two reason, reasons that caused me to like THE ILLUSIONIST and made me disappointed in THE PRESTIGE. First least significant was the magic performed: I was far more entertained by the former movie's magic tricks than the latter, which were explained and therefore less magical--even the ""scientific"" tricks, which I will not spoil here. Second and far more important, was the level of intelligence in the plot and the writing of the film. THE PRESTIGE suffered, in my opinion, from twists that become illogical, right to the very end which was obvious to me from the middle of the film. Meanwhile, THE ILLUSIONIST, which again I admit tainted my experience by raising the proverbial bar and challenging THE PRESTIGE, brilliantly revealed incredibly intricate plot motivations and actions that we only figure out at the very ending of the film--though I suspect many viewers will not put all the pieces of THE ILLUSIONIST together even after being handed the details by film's end. In short, THE PRESTIGE was an enjoyable film for high school students and for people who want to see a movie by will not think about what is happening. THE ILLUSIONIST is for college graduates who actually earned their degree. I realize this sounds very snobbish, for which I am sorry. But I am trying to be honest.",6
30 January 2007,Machines - Clones and Actors,"I have just watched the movie and I agree with a few people here.

As far as the MOVIE goes the machine works... why are we to believe this?

1) The Hats and Cats is a big clue 2) The WARNINGS about 'no good will come of this' from the bloke who invented it and the fact he said his first inventions challenged people but do it again and they are so flabbergasped (is that a word) they can't believe 3) Various quotes I wont go in to 4) The EXTRA guy in the tank at the end.

If you look at the last few moments of the film you see there are a LOT of tanks in the basement area... all probably full of the same fella (sorry bad memory for names lol). Kinda a giveaway huh!

They say the simple truth is the hardest to grasp and makes for the best illusion ... the simplest explanation is the unbelievable truth the machine works!

Its only a film so I can go with this, hell if I wanna rip a film for unbelievability and paradox I will watch 'Back to the future' 1 - 2 and 3 ... but the idea of a movie as with magic is to without our sense on disbelief and THIS film does that perfectly as the twist is... there is no twist! It WORKED and its kinda sick when yu think about it!

AND THERE IS MORE....

Remember the bird in the cage trick ... one smushed bird (Same deal)

Loads more to look at in the film, but basically it says magic lies between the lines and thats the illusion, when the illusion is best placed ON the lines where you Don't expect it to be found!

Either way, its got everyone here talking about it and I think I will get the DVD for the extras to see if they have an alt ending with clones everywhere covered in squashed doves:)

ENJOY THE FILM

3 January 2013,"Brilliant, Under-rated film","I think this film is a vastly under-rated feature and is one of Nolan's best in terms of the narrative and plot. The film is great in that it keeps you thinking throughout with it's woven non-linear structure and the cast that are in the film seem perfect for their respective characters, the film charts the personal and professionally rivalry between two magicians in the Victorian age with each ruining each others performances in a different number of ways before building up to it's twist of a climax, Michael Caine plays his role well as the fatherly figure for Algier (Hugh Jackman)whilst the leading cast play it well as two men obsessed with topping the other as things take a turn for the worst the more the film plays out, for me Bale's character Borden is the better of the two but Jackman still puts in a great performance.

25 October 2021,The greatest film no one understands!,"This has to be one of the most brilliant films ever made.

It's been 15 years now. In that time you'd think people would have figured out the films secret, yet very few have. And I'll bet those that have likely have a background in magic. Even the critics missed it. It's remarkable Nolan's discipline to the subject matter.

I won't reveal the trick, as the nature of the film begs a magician never reveal his tricks. I will only say pay attention and listen to the beginning and ending lines. Even if you can't grasp it, the film is still excellent. Some of the misdirection will be explained and that is solid on its own.

Remember the man with the fish bowl!

11 November 2006,Astonishing!,"This film is why you go to the theater and then back and then another time. From the first to the last it delivers. With gorgeous design, utterly engrossing performances it never misses a beat. The brooding and darkness in places are deep but subtle and never overpower the story. I found myself turning the story and characters over and over in mind and even found my dreams influenced. Typically the impact of a film leaves me as soon as I walk out of the theater. I've not felt the impact of film in such a personal way since The Dead Poets Society.

My one complaint is the non-linearity of the story in key places. It definitely takes multiple watchings (and multiple eyeballs) to catch all the twists and turns and a rewind control would be welcome. However I feel that to be a slight fault and for the academy to pass this one up without at least a nomination would be a unpardonable blunder.

1 November 2006,A Tremendous Roller Coaster Ride of Twists and Turns,"I recently saw the Prestige with a few of my friends and i was blown away. Right from the beginning this film grips you with a very powerful opening scene that is the climax of the story i thought this was unusual at first but then it went into flashbacks and flashbacks and flashbacks telling the story of 2 rival magicians. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine bring incredible performances. One of Christian Bale's best same goes for Jackman. This movie starts out with a bunch of loose ends in the story and gradually these ends are tied and revealing more of the story. They reveal little pieces of the story to you throughout the film and they are brought to a close at different times. This keeps the film very intriguing at all times seldom does the story slow down. tony Scott has outdone himself in this film. The camera works is beautifully done and the locations are perfect.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM IT IS A MASTERPIECE AND SHOULD NEVER BE OVERLOOKED.",8
9 November 2006,The Art Of MAGIC!,"The movie captured the art of magic, its complexities and wonder. The characters are rich--they really have something to evoke every audience. They have GREAT MOTIVE... and that's what the audience need-- a reason to stay on the journey of the characters. This fact will put you to the edge until the denouement.

What I really liked about the film is that it was presented as such a normal, ordinary plot, just like any other movie in a periodic setting. Furthermore, the director presented the theme-envy, obsession, and deceit, in the coolest way to present these things--SUBTLE! The cast was too good. This film exposes one of the BEST ""RIVALRY"" stories of the decade. I'd have to give it a thousand claps and a HANDS DOWN!

There were a few who hated the movie. Yes, it tells nothing about benevolence. Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self-preservation. And yes, the director may have over-sensationalized the theme for some (But I think he presented it as subtle as he could). he thing here is that the decisions made by the director works for the advantage of the film. Why would I feel bad if there is not one character who conveyed a positive disposition? The nature of the characters reflects human nature--and as long as a character does that--it is REAL. We should not be looking for a benign protagonist here--besides, that's getting OLD. Films that project NON-CONTRAST between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights. They are laying off the archetypes, the formulaic sense that's been going' on in the film industry for the past 10 years, which should be the case now in the 21st century film-making. AT LEAST THIS MOVIE TRIED, and as far as I know, SUCEEDED.",
2 February 2018,"Wonderful, Mind-Twist Period Piece","Incredible film, really loved it. The costumes and set are beautiful and bring you right into the world, enveloping you in the magic right away. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry you through the tension with great finesse. Loved it.

3 February 2007,Are You Watching Closely?,"The competition between Bale and Jackman is mesmerizing. They each have a separate way of drawing you in and making you sympathize with their own struggle. Jackman is a man completely obsessed with finding the secret to Bale's mysterious abilities. Bale, it seems, is only half a man at any given time, sometimes completely engulfed in his magic and illusions, other times he is a warm loving husband and father who just happens to be a magician. Every time Jackman and Bale are on the screen together you can feel yourself pulling to the edge of your seat waiting to see whats next in their quarrel for greatness. Deep and dark secrets lie in both men, but you cant help but wonder who has taken it too far. With more than a few unexpected plot twists, and laden with hidden clues throughout the movie as to the truth behind both men, The Prestige is a movie you need to watch at least twice. While you watch it ask yourself, as Bale says many times throughout the film, are you watching closely?

23 December 2006,excellent,"was a brilliant movie!!! beginning was a bit slow but yes very good. it was hard to understand though the ending. a quite confusing film but thats what made it so great. i don't recommend it for those who want a simple film as it is far from it. its not like those straight forward type films, in which a simpleton could understand. there are dark aspects to it which could shake up people but it gives it that suspense feel which makes you want to watch more. i was sort of put off with the film at first as it was a very boring start. it doesn't attract audiences to stay and watch the film, but lucky i did. like other film this has a slow start which may put you off but i do say that you must stay and watch the rest. overall i think everyone should watch it, it does give you different sort of movie.

25 July 2023,Nolan Played a Trick On Us,"Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"", the second act is called ""The Turn"", and the third part is called ""The Prestige"". And Christopher Nolan did it successfully in this film. The way that this concept mimics the entire film's storytelling is seriously mind-blowing!

The ending is one hell of a twist that left me completely speechless. As soon as the movie ended and the credits rolled, I couldn't stop thinking about the line ""are you watching closely?"". A lot of easter eggs hidden in plain sight that foreshadowed the entire plot, but like an audience to The Great Danton show, I was just staring mindlessly, waiting to be fooled. It's definitely one of those films where you immediately felt the need to see again after watching it.

The movie explores the themes of obsession, mastery, and rivalry, in such a playful and riviting way. And what a thrill to watch them outdo each other even to a point of sabotaging.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is equally dazzling and did amazing job in their roles respectively. But I would say I am in absolute awe of Christian Bale's performance.

A solid 10/10 for me and for sure one of my favorite films of all time!",10

30 October 2006,Just Plain Stupid.,"the era was ridiculous, the magic acts unbelievable, more like just plain Computer Graphics. The entire concept of this film is just pure loony. ""magic""? come on ! Only the stupid would regard any of this stuff entertaining. Dialogue was even dumber. Camera angles BORING . Yeah, tree's disappearing into thin air. Hahaha. so stupid. I was laughing so much in the Theatre. This IMDb is totally inaccurate. or the demographic is certainly skewed. The only redeeming element of this film was David Bowie's Character Nikola Tesla. If anyone can perform acts of extraordinary ability it'd be Nikola, he was a genius ignored by Americans cause of his Jewish/Hungarian heritage. Not to mention how Thomas Edison started a propaganda Campaign to discredit Nikola's inventions. Nikola developed a device that would allow the conversion of energy in such an efficient way that he wanted it to be Free. A free energy/electricity for everybody. Thomas Edison didn't want people to benefit from Free energy. and blah blah blah,.. okay the movie was just plain stupid, did I write enough here yet ?

23 January 2007,A weak spot in the setup,"We are mystified about which kind of knot Borden ties before the accident, and I find it strange, however dramatically efficient, that Nolan doesn't use the question until the burial. I think that in real life that would be the first thing one would check to see what went wrong with a trivial trick - especially because it has been an issue between them. But certainly a highly entertaining movie, with great acting, beautiful pictures, and a catching storyline. Like ""The Departed"" it is a movie one can watch over and over again and still enjoy for it's many twists and cleverly situated clues. The mind-blowing experiment with electricity which is accredited to Dr Telsa, is symbolically destroyed by Edison. The rivalry of the plot mirrors itself on another level, bringing back the words of Oscar Wilde from the same period: ""The world is(...)tolerant, it will forgive anything; except genius.""

15 January 2023,"Uncomfortable, Disturbing and Equally Amazing","This is Nolan's most disturbing movie to date. Two magicians with a bit of ideological difference in the beginning, which is converted into a dangerous and unhealthy competition. This is one of the more disturbing PG -13 movies. This movie has flashbacks inter cutting the narrative, which helps the movie a lot in terms of the suspense. The world feels dirty and lived in. Costume designs, music, cinematography all give this movie the atmosphere it needs.

I won't get into the spoilers, but there is plot point which could have easily been ridiculous. But somehow it doesn't feel out of place at all.

Overall, this movie deals with Obsession and Vengeance and what does these do to men and those around them.

28 October 2006,Very predictable... the movie that should have had it's own,"disappearing act.... totally cheesy. Geesh... The plot was interesting at first but became annoying and petty as the two magicians jealously attacked their so-called ""tricks"". It was as if it was expected for me to become OVERWHELMED with emotion as I learned the true magic behind one of the tricks... hell, the ""magic"" behind this trick was predicted 30 minutes before it was revealed... my friend and I both fidgeted and just wished that the damn movie would just end sans all the needless drama at the end... BTW, how long does it take to die from a gunshot to the abdomen? Whaaaaah... the pain, the misery, the demise of a wicked magician... Blah, blah, blah... the bottom line... boring, predictable, cheesy.

I love the spiritual elements added to this story of jealousy and revenge. David Bowie played Nikola Tesla so well that I cant stop thinking of tesla with Bowies face since I have seen this ( a month ago).

25 October 2006,A Magic Trick of a Movie,"I'll make this short and sweet.

What makes this movie so special? Well, its played out like a magic trick, and exactly how the opening monologue describes one.

The movie takes us to the time of magicians who were considered the premium entertainers of the day, and also into the dark world of the underbelly of magicians. Bale and Jackman nail their roles, and draw you into the film. Johannson and Bowie add some flavor, and I loved Michael Caine's character Cutter. Nolan plays the role of magician with his directing, twisting and turning your mind, making you want more and then delivering.

I had the choice between this and Flags of our Fathers. I went to this with the expectation of an ""average"" movie. I feel now that I saw the better film. It is original, it is deep and I want to see it again.

We need more films like ""The Prestige,"" because they draw you into the movie to the point where when you finally reach the films conclusion, you feel as if you had not been shown a story, but where right there when it all happened.

10/10 I hope this get some Oscar consideration.",10
12 January 2021,Unbelievably perfect,"I loved each and every scene in the movie. the acting, the directing, the detailed plot and the sound track! they got all my attention every scene, each character stole me their world. i watched it yesterday and god it will take me weeks to get over this, and i dont think i ever will!

28 February 2007,a huge let-down,"Coming from the director of 2 gripping movies in Memento and Batman begins,""The Prestige"" is a complete let-down.The story line is very thin and plot revealed at the end makes it look like a joke.It might precisely been his intention-to explain ow ludicrously simple magic tricks are-but then I wouldn't want to spending 2.5 hours of completely non-sensical attempts of sabotage(some of them had me in guffaws at the ridiculous stupidity of it all)only to find I was being taken for a ride all along. I can't help feeling he has tried to make a simple narrative needlessly complex trying to give psychological connotations to the entire story, and ""going back and forth in time"" stuff-which was completely unnecessary. Clearly he's suffering from ""Memento"" hangovers. At least,a genuine attempt at character development would have ensured that the magicians mind connected with the audience but sadly that was not to be.At times, I wondered if I was watching a comedy movie gone wrong or genuinely made to go wrong.Performances too are ordinary.Only thing that saves the movie are the few moments of good direction,good visuals and not to forget,the magic tricks that are demystified!",4
25 May 2020,great,"The subversion of the audience's usual expectations is the film's recurring pattern, made possible by a double-nested system of flashbacks and cross-cutting -- the audience often knows the ending before the events of the story have happened. The high frequency of flashbacks and cross-cutting further increases the beguilement of the story, making the audience completely lost in the elaborately constructed narrative maze.

6 May 2007,Great film! Very under-rated!,"You can't even begin to write a comment for this film without trying to give the plot away. Christopher Nolan has really shown his depth and imagination with this film. Its fantastically edited and directed. It's cleverly narrated through two magicians diaries, one reading the others of past events, with several scenes deployed in the middle which show current events.

The film is about two magicians, Borden (Bale) & Angier (Jackman) who become rivals after an accident at a show (that they have been performing before), where the magician on stage picks two members from the audience (ie: Bale and Jackman), they tie up Angier's partner by the hands and feet. She goes into the glass cage filled with water...from here on - the rivalry starts. Throughout the film, Bale & Angier are determined to get the better of each other by coming up with better tricks, but the film takes such a dark twist into something more sinister, which is what the makes the film's conclusion so great and simple. It's not until Borden perfoms the most greatest trick that Angier has ever seen, that he is determined to better Borden's. This leads onto a great exploration of one person's desperation to seek his true goal in life, to become the greatest magician over Borden.

A lot of people here say ""Oh it was predictable"" - maybe it was, but then, you still don't expect even when you know the truth.

It's a film that didn't really give the impact that it probably should of done on the public, it wasn't a huge film publicity wise, but its a great film with a magnificent story, and the acting is second to-none. Cane, Johansson and Bowie do fanatastic jobs as sub characters - although Johansson's English accent is one to be questioned.

Overall its a really enjoyable film, a tiny bit long, but the story drags you in to make you watch it to the end. Top purchase on DVD! Go buy!",8
1 November 2006,A movie that isn't as smart as it tries to be,"First of all, I can't speak to the quality of any of the performances, since I don't really tend to notice these things. So just to be clear: my rating isn't a comment on any of the actors.

Basically, whether or not I enjoyed this movie came down to my reaction to the multiple twists in this movie...and I saw most of them coming a mile away. So did the two people I saw the movie with. It seems like the movie could have been smarter, and the twists could possibly have been concealed better, but edited together in this way, the movie just seemed like a hack version of a better movie.

I found the concept of two feuding magicians interesting, and I came into the movie hopeful, but I was ultimately let down by a movie that was too long and didn't handle a nonlinear storyline very well.

6 December 2006,"Good film, bad ending","A great film, if a little predictable, which is only slightly spoilt by an ending which is 'somewhat' unbelievable.

However the acting is great - Bale and Jackman are very good (Oscars nominations should beckon for both, although in my opinion Bale does steal the edge). They are excellently backed up by Michael Caine (who is as always great in films that he wants to be great in, and this is definitely one of them!).

A film which I have recommended all my friends to definitely go and see, if only to see if they guess the Bale twist as soon as I did.

In summary, it is good Saturday night out stuff.

23 October 2006,A great mix of inventive storytelling amid the mystery of magic,"Sure, there are explosions and fires and bursts of electricity. There is at least one death and one chase scene, but there is more to this one. It's a compelling and often brilliant story about magic, science, good and evil. And it's set in 20th century London. The film is almost flawless.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fine as rivaling magicians. They trade the roles of antagonist and protagonist throughout the film. And Bale has continued becoming a very interesting actor, at least one who takes really great roles. Though, Michael Caine really steals the show. He has a very warm role as Putter, the teacher, who is wise and complicated. Rebecca Hall is brilliant as Sarah, Rupert's wife. And David Bowie is less irritating than usual as the great Tesla. The editing is slick and helps the movie progress seamlessly. It's a very involving movie.

5 January 2007,"Dark, mysterious and a very human story...","It was a very ""dark"" film which showed me how far a man can go for success by any mean.. it was Christopher Nolan's best film ever.. the performances where very very good,very touching.. Christian bale was the best and it suites him this kind of roles.. leaving the cinema Theadora i felt a pain on my chest and from that i understood that the film was in me..this is the way i can sense if a film is the best like v for vendetta or million $ baby or mystic river and lord of the rings..Hugh Jackman has talent but except this role he chooses wrong films some times.. in this films he was the best to stand against C.Bale.. this film can be nominated at the Oscars for 1st actor Christiane Bale 2nd actor David Bowie best director Christopher Nolan best score David Julan 2nd actress Borden's wife(Sarah) and hardly best picture.. but if this not happen that's alright.. i;m gonna still love this film..

13 October 2013,The prestige of human's mind,"Two-hours pondering over the question - is there anything in that world wherein you can believe unreservedly in its veracity. Can we so easily confide in the apparent, aren't we the ones who let ourselves being fooled in the skillful illusion of the hidden and unknown. And when someone gives us a hint for that trick where the disappeared comes back we find the prestige of human's mind. Like a great magician Christopher Nolan makes the pledge, takes the turn and hand us the prestige. My total favourite. The flick is wonderfully engrossing mystery. That's the magic trick of the cinema- it spellbind you from the very beginning. I loved it to death. I want to see it again.

12 November 2013,A masterpiece!,"An absolutely brilliant film, one of my favorites! Keeps you thinking. Definitely one for those that liked Inception Bale's performance in this is brilliant, one of his best I feel (Perhaps only beaten by his performance in American Psycho). Jackman is also brilliant, and Caine of course great as usual :) My only disappointment is that I didn't see this before!!! Nolan did brilliantly with keeping the audience on edge and keeping them thinking. More twists and turns than... a twisty thing.

A word of warning: you may have to watch it more than once to understand it all! I also advise you watch with subtitles, especially for the quieter bits

2 July 2020,JUST INCREDIBLE,"Christopher Nolan is my favourite director, he loves messing with people's minds. His movies especially the endings, he always leaves them for interpretations leaving you talking and talking about them. The Prestige is a story about two rival magicians trying to find each other's secrets. The themes are strong in this film such as rivalry, obsession, love, commitment and sacrifice. The secret in this film is the dialogue. You have to pay complete attention otherwise you miss out. It's well-acted, well-directed, excellent dialogue and well crafted. What else can you say about Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan, there are geniuses. A+ Film

15 July 2010,Good movie,"I'd have given it a 9, but I gave it an 8 because of the lack of the climax. It was a good movie; very good,I'd say. But I can't seem to find out what moment is the peak of the action. It's all too flat; not insipid-but flat.

Now that I've mentioned the only problem this movie has, the good parts:

Interesting mix of history and magic. It successfully recreates the XIX century atmosphere; not like a glance of the past though, but like a glance of another dimension. And this maybe because of the fact that -unlike other magic-based plots- it let's you take a look at the methods they use, it let's you see the magicians world not as an intruder, but as if being one of them.

1 April 2011,if you believe in tricks ... you have to keep secrets..,"A great magician experience from Chistopher Nolan. It is a perfectly crafted mind game. Christian Bale was incredible and unforgettable as an overly eccentric magician(s). It was also one of the best performances from the Powerhouse known as Hugh Jackman . i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, after all Jack & Bale effect..... can't leave..

8 January 2007,The Prestige is a smart twist on the vengeance angle,"The Prestige uses visual excitement,through magic tricks, to keep you interested,but the story line is also magical. After seeing The Prestige 3 times, I realized how much of the plot was visually laid out in front of my eyes, and I still missed it. Gosh, it was great to see a movie that can be watched over and over, and grow better each time you see it. The book, which was re-released and is the same copy written in 1975. It is nothing like the movie(though the book story is good), but the screen play writers need to be commended on their ability to take a small concept from the book and change it into the wonderful story they created. I can't wait to buy The Prestige movie, when it comes out next month.

8 April 2023,You will finally see the Prestige,"My recommendations are to see the movie. Why would you not want to see it if it brings the life of Tesla to the movies? After all is that not one of the most electrifying names in the universe. Unfortunately, the movie just covers a small part but it's still interesting. Also, dear chat GPT please stay out of my life. The movie shows the suspicious and incredulous parts of magic. I like the quotes in the movie ""our bodies conduct and produce energy."". Also, man's reason exceeds his grasp the truth

""man's grass exceeds his nerve."" also, one day the world chooses destiny."" and take a guess. Who did those quotes are from? The trick or the magic that they were showing was pretty simple to understand. It clearly would be when they would well I don't wanna spoil it, so I'm gonna leave it right there and I truly agree that simple is not always easy, especially in their case. And I thought it was ingenuous and how they went over the three parts of a magic . For the ones don't watch it , first you know that something is ordinary and then you turn something that is ordinary into something that is. Extremely remarkable, unique. Finally, you make the item disappear, and that in itself is amazing however, as they clearly said in the movie in order to make it extremely uncommon or extraordinary you must make it reappear. Nonetheless aren't we are always transforming or being transformed in someway. The first time I watch this movie there must've been some distractions because there are parts to this movie that were not clear and now, after watching it a second time I have been made whole.",7
20 January 2017,Magic is from long-term preparation,"Sacrifice, that's the price of a good trick. Actually, from the very beginning, the screen script has all told us how the two trick were played. Change the cage and bird into the box and magician, then there comes the answer. I am shocked by the skills used by Nolan, a genius director. Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. This movie also taught me that if I want to do something very hard, I must have my own way and prepare for it for a long time which is also seen in the movie ""Now You See Me.""

24 November 2006,The audience likes to be fooled,"As sportsmen say, reaching the top is not the toughest part, but maintaining oneself there. Each new prestigious movie director can say so, and Christopher Nolan is no different. After Memento's clamorous success, in 2000, he's achieved great prestige among filmmakers and the audience. Nonetheless, some disappointing pictures, such as Insomnia and Batman Forever, made his prestige to be questioned. Recovering credibility is a demanding job, and Nolan's The Prestige managed to bedazzle the audience again. As Truffaut once said, cinema is the art of deceiving. Nothing is real, as well as in magic, when the audience is intensely pleased to be fooled. Knowing that, Nolan used magic as the main ingredient of his tasty recipe. And the utterly irresistible result is completed with a mix of great actors (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as protagonists, plus the terrific supporting roles performed by Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie), realistic costumes, gloomy photography and a powerful direction. Not even the presence of the element ""Deus ex ma china"", a Latin phrase used to describe an unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction or drama to resolve a situation or untangle a plot, has managed to spoil The Prestige's magic. If you want to be thrilled by the duel of two men willing to prove who were the best of their professions at that time, this is your call. And don't worry, it's okay to be fooled.",8
29 March 2022,Not My Favorite,"First I just want to preface by saying this is my opinion, if you don't agree with it just ignore it. My girlfriend loves this movie so I decided to give it a shot, after watching it I was disappointed. The cinematography was great and the acting was beautiful. The plot was not my favorite, I honestly got quite bored until the ending. There were lots of time skips that make you confused as to what's happening. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time but I definitely would've been fine not watching it.

14 July 2017,Great!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind- boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

27 October 2006,does not deserve to be on top 250,"enjoyable-yes, predictable-no Christopher Nolan's newest film has elements of suspense and surprise that will shock and throw you off guard but we've come to expect that from him. This film is no masterpiece such as Nolan's ""Memento"" but has many enjoyable qualities. The acting is for the most part superb with great performances by Michael Caine, Jackman, Bale and most surprisingly David Bowie as the mysterious ""Tesla"". Though this may be an enjoyable movie it sure as hell does not deserve to be on the top 250. Only due to ""fanboys"" of Nolan did this movie make the top 250 and that is pitiful. People should not rate a movie because they are infatuated by the director or his earlier work. In all, an enjoyable movie but IT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE SAME LIST AS ""THE GODFATHER"" OR EVEN ""MEMENTO""!!!

15 July 2008,Great performance from the two leads but not a great film,"Both Jackman and Bale are excellent in this film and the sets and camera work are also really good. Petty quibbles would be yet another rubbish performance from David Bowie as a scientist and the boring choice of Micheal Caine for the character Cutter.

This aside my main reason for ending up a bit disappointed with The Prestige was that I saw the end coming about 30 minutes into the film. I can't say I'm the most astute at spotting endings and it's not something I concentrate on when watching films either so I reckon the film just made it too easy.

Still worth a look for the beautiful production and for the main performances.

26 November 2011,The Prestige: A critique on the concept of movie,"I conceive that the any movie as a matter of fact can become successful if its core is a concept. Its a movie pertaining to human behaviors who are interested in becoming successful by following an idealism. whenever two persons fighting to achieve a single idealism finds it hard to find the secrets of that idealism, or he wrongly interprets the idealism, then he reaches a stage of perverted mind set. Even in this movie Hugh Jackman though right in presenting himself as a magician, making illusions, he goes wrong by losing his ""prestige"" both in show as well as in understanding the idealism. In spite of Mr.Cutter's immense knowledge of the trick, Jackman does not believe his words. The human behavior is to keenly know what others are doing and do the same either steal or copy or pull their legs for the self raise. But when it satisfies the extent of challenging the nature, nature or the destiny makes sure that it will always exist by destroying the unnatural one. The story has a nice balance and surprise maintained till the climax designed by Director Mr.Nole. The story also depicts how two mental status under a single guidance(teacher) turning into two rivals because of business and PRESTIGE issues. Prestige when exceeds the desires and ambitions of winning the others at the cost of challenging the nature, though nature looses some of its very needy part, does not hesitate to destroy the artificial existence. All that we need to remember is :- Anything Great deserves Sacrifice.",8
3 November 2006,The ending was stupid,"The ending was stupid.The rest of the movie was very good.But the ending was very stupid....I was disappointed at the very extreme level of confusion with the writing at the end.The writers were too clever for their own good;as I was trying to extract the meaning of the picture after the credits rolled and I still was not sure exactly what had happened.Too bad.There was no need to befuddled the viewer at wrap time.The crux of the story was very enjoyable to follow.If not for the lame ending I would give this movie a 9 and not a 7.....I was hoping for a finish like Memento.There would have been nothing wrong with closing the story is a plausible and intelligible way.Not to be though I guess...

28 June 2010,"Good? no, GREAT !","It's a twisted complicated not-short movie ! that gets all of your five senses! from its very first moment to its amazing unexpected ending! i must say, both the actors did a great believable job, and boredom becomes impossible while watching this masterpiece. the directing was great, the acting, and most importantly the twist in the end. movies like the prestige mostly are the kind that you watch for just once for some reason, the ones that you watch for more than once are those simple happy movies, or Disney movies, yet, for some reason, I tend to enjoy the prestige every time it's on TV, great much? INDEED! if you haven't gotten the chance to watch this masterpiece yet, go for it!

22 October 2006,Oscar Sleeper,"Sleeper for Oscar. The suspense keeps adding up throughout to an unbelievably astonishing and satisfying ending. I predict Best Supporting nominations for Michael Cain and Scarlett Johansson. Best Actor nod for Hugh Jackman and Best Picture nomination. I went in at the urging of my wife and was incredibly captivated with this saga. I never knew what ""The Prestige"" meant (or is), but was slowly drawn into it's full meaning through the skillful writing and the expert acting and staging of this period piece of art. Not only skillful acting, writing and staging, but magnificent and sweeping cinematography and a score that, while unnoticed during the movie, came to a crescendo that matched the satisfaction I felt at the end.

23 September 2020,movie reviews or film reviews.,"Basically, was the message. What started as a trickle of refugees became a vast flood. ""The Tower"" is beautiful to look at, elegantly filmed, with very good performances across the board. There are multiple story-lines (too many, really) and a big cast of intersecting characters (its literary source-material is evident in the adaptation). At its best, ""The Tower"" shows what life felt like to those who lived at that singular time, to those who dozed ""pitifully and apathetically"" in an unchanging political system before the rules changed, seemingly overnight. Richard Hoffman (Jan Josef Liefers) is a surgeon at a clinic in Dresden, with burn tissue all over his back, an eternal reminder of the 1945 firebombing of his hometown when he was a child. He is married to a nurse (Claudia Michelsen), and they have a teenage son named Christian (Sebastian Urzendowsky). Richard has been carrying on an affair with his secretary that has resulted in a child, now 5 years old. Hoffman goes back and forth between t

11 March 2007,Horrible Except For,"This has to be the year's worst film. An utter discombobulated mess. The acting hear is so bad it is mind-boggling. Michael Caine turns in perhaps his worst performance as some sort of wizard or something to that effect. Christian Bale is equally putrid in his role as one of the feuding magicians, this film makes absolutely no sense and its shocking failure is augmented pathetically by worst of all, Hugh Jackman. A clearly homosexual man being tormented by his crushing demons, he can't seem to get his mind focused for a second on his role as the second feuding magician. Christopher Nolan once again proves to be one of the worst and gratuitously artsy directors. This film fails miserably as anything but a pure pile of rubbish. Michael Caine has completely tarnished his legacy with another unfocused, unnecessary role. One bright spot is Scarlett Johansson however lifting this film all the way to a 4 from a 1 with her sheer beauty and pure excellence, reaffirming her status as the world's most talented actress.

5 June 2017,Seen a dozen times but the same pleasure every time,"A movie that keep you in it from the start to the end. The first thing I thought of at the end of the movie was to ask myself when I was going to be able to watch it again. A good intrigue that keeps on going in which you really try to understand what is going on. A good acting game that makes it all fabulous. In addition, we learn a lot about magic and how a magic trick is organized so that it is successful. This is just one of my favorite movies, if you have not seen it, do not wait anymore!

I liked the hole story, from A to Z. The acting, the clothes, the twists, everything was amazing and joyful. The stars of this movie (Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman & Scarlett Johansson) were really stars and performing their turns with high precision. I want to see more movies like this one.

21 November 2011,poor cinema,"Why is this described as a thriller, a mystery? It had neither thrill, nor mystery, nor intelligence for that matter.

When I look for movies to watch I always mention my favorites (Memento, The Game etc.) hoping for similar kind of cinematic entertainment, and eventually this movie came up. It was supposed to be as intense, interesting and intelligent as the mentioned ones. But, it was just one big disappointment. Maybe, if I had no expectations, the experience of watching it would have been better...

I suppose this might be thrilling and suspenseful for someone who usually doesn't prefer that genre and is used to the ""lighter"" movies you don't have to put much thought in. But even for that person this wouldn't be the first pick for an evening at the cinema, so I really don't understand the amount of attention this movie got.

13 October 2018,"""Are you watching closely""","Christopher Nolan is a master!!

To those who say that this film give away everything this film stands for and makes us think that we are stupid...that's what it's all about! This film is about magicians and just what magicians want to achieve, is to make their audience think they are stupid... because they do not see certain things in the trick, which are logical. However, it is pushed under their noses. And this is exactly what this film does. Just like a magic show, this film contains one twist/surprise after another. A great achievement from Nolan and cast & crew.

What I love in Nolan's movies, is when he plays with time. In almost all his films, he forms the ""normal"" story structure to a complex whole. And every time he surprises me again.

The only minus is the fact that, during Alfred's shows, Alfred's assistant always picks Angie out of the crowd and vice versa. In most of Angie's shows, Alfred was taken out of the crowd to check the objects on the scene. This was not realistic.

But... to all who want to be amazed and immersed in the world of magic, watch this masterpiece!!",9

28 December 2006,"Excellent, but David Bowie was for me the unexpected triumph","I loved the film for many reasons. But one of them is an element of the film that will probably be ignored by most other reviewers so I feel the need to underline it: David Bowie in this movie did the unbelievable. He performed a character who is *more* conventional in every possible way than he himself is. The way he found to totally camouflage his own outstanding (exceptionally weird) self and to invoke an entirely different self who beamed a totally different intensity is ...obscure to me. Astoundingly artful.

In a way, he captured the greatness of the character he had played in the ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" by being someone entirely different. And (coincidence?) the character he plays in ""The Prestige"" (the real historical person) is also rumoured to have ""fallen to Earth"". Plus he had a similar lifepath to the character David Bowie played in the ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" - but a radically different persona, a mesmerizingly stable, solid presence with intent and intensity.

A perception bender. Prestigious prestidigitation.

8 February 2023,Nolans most underrated movie,"Most of Chris Nolans movies have goten plenty of atention (a little to much atention if you ask me) but this one is rarly mentioned. That is such a shame since this, in my opinion is his second best movie after The Dark Knight.

Positivs: The performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are fantastic, this might be some of Hughs best work.

The story and the way is presented is great, it is told out of order but is extreamly unpredictable.

The setting in 1890s England is great with fantastic production design. The truths behind the magic tricks are also intresting.

Basiclly everything technical.

(Potential) Negativs: There is a thing at the end which comes out of nowhere and doesnt really match the rest of the movie.

The ""Nolan Style"" which I personally find a bit annoying at times. (The sometimes unnatural dialogue which attempt to sound smarter than it is and his editing-pacing which feel a bit weird and artificial).

Conclusion: The Prestige is a great and underrated Nolan film which deserves to be seen by everyone.",9

10 June 2010,The Pledge. The Turn. THE PRESTIGE.,"In an era where most human perception was still inferior to the magic of the lightest human tricks, comes a montage of amazement from the blinded audience.

It's also the applause, the acceptance, the stunned audience's hunger for curiosity why these self proclaimed magicians thrive in an environment where your name is only as good as your last show.

It is for this same reason why rivalry emanates among them. They study, they search and drools for the required learning to ecstatically shout that they own that next best kept secret in town. For what? For The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige.

The Prestige is an enigmatic film. It's smart, that you can fall for its conundrum or choose to just wait as a patient spectator. Or, you can even be smart enough to just open your eyes, as the film quotation tells us, ""Are you watching closely?""

If appropriate praises are needed for cleverly making this film, then I would simply give it hands own to, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan for the FANTASTIC screenplay, the great editors of this film for expertly putting this puzzle in one piece and off course, to the person who started it all, Christopher Priest.

And for the cast, to me they are sort of pieces of puzzle that incredibly fit to fill every space in the story board, Good job.

I won't dare to give any detail from any act in this film. It's better to watch it with a sense of urgency to literally look out for the answer like every magician's audience does. After all, the same enlightenment we get from any magic does not differ from any. We learn it is always about detail.

It's safe to say, that this Nolan's masterpiece is centered about magic but is never entirely about it. The film's depth is about human ""ambition"". Frailty as an effect of the consequences following that bold dream and is subsequent when be fallen to an obsession. But it is also that human ""will"" that won't stop us chasing it. For every little inch we grasp by reaching it fascinates us, wanting more. And for what Again?

1 July 2015,Best Movie Ever,"The Prestige is about two magicians in 19th Century England whose friendship turns into a lifelong rivalry as they go to any and all lengths in order to one-up each other on their quest to create the ultimate illusion, something that would make that David Blaine weirdo run for the hills with his tail between his legs.

Who knew people took magic so seriously?

So for some reason, this movie came out at the same time as The Illusionist – also about a magician doing his thing in 19th Century England – and I find that people constantly mistake the two. But make no mistake folks, The Prestige is the one to see.

It's directed by Christopher Nolan, and, really, what else is there to say. He's one of the best at what he does and it's been crystal for a while now that he's got this whole storytelling thing down to a science. And while the look and feel of this movie is very sleek and stylish in keeping with Nolan's prior and future efforts, the most impressive thing about this movie is the way in which he structures it.",10

22 December 2021,Lost Focus,"Somehow Nolan thought that it was more interesting to focus on two silly man-children locked in a race to do the best magic, rather than the two actual geniuses who brought us modern electricity. At least there were stakes in the feud between Edison and Tesla; there is literally no reward for either Bale or Jackman to be crowned best magician. For a more interesting clash of two white guys fighting for fame in a field much less silly than magic, watch ""Amadeus.""

13 May 2020,One of the best films I have seen!,"The movie itself plays like a magic trick. The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige.

Throughout the film, Nolan has kept the secret (which is revealed in the end) in plain sight but we are not really looking. Only during my second watch was I able to notice all the minute details.

Also, towards the end we may feel a little disappointed after knowing the secret because well, afterall, ""we want to be fooled"".

I need not talk about the actors. They are amazing! Each one of them!

Overall, the movie is worth watching more than once. Highly recommended!

15 February 2007,"The Prestige set out as a thriller, but ended as a fairytale","The Prestige is about two rivaling magicians that started as colleagues, but an unfortunate even led them to be enemies obsessed with the others failure. Then they go through great lengths to sabotage and steal the other person's tricks, for revenge and for a magicians honor.

The movie is entertaining, because the setting/scenario is quite original - except that there is also the Illusionist, but that movie has a different theme - and Christopher Nola directed it. It made the story telling very interesting. However as the twist and turns unfold, you start to expect a brilliant ending, I call that the 'Wow'-factor. You remember watching Memento and at the end you find out he already avenged his wife and you go Woooowwwww in your mind ;-) The 'wow'-factor in The Prestige is disappointingly low as they use unrealistic elements to do the ending that you're not prepared for in the beginning. The let you expect it's all science behind the illusions and tricks, but then half-way the movie they come with something new and scientifically speaking, utterly nonsense.

So set yourself for one of the most entertaining movie right now, and you'll enjoy it even more if you don't take the movies realism serious. Great acting from Christian and Hugh that alone is worth the time.",9
24 May 2008,Waste of time,"Whenever I can identify a bad movie at first sight it makes me laugh and not at all angry. Al least I know what genre I see and this makes me calibrate my expectations. The word ""magic"" causes three different levels for me: 1.Real magic,you may believe or not like being told existing in other cultures 2.The magic of illusionists like Mr.Copperfield and friends and 3.The typical writers magic like Potter or Jeckyll/Hide(pure fiction) I saw this movie without any previous knowledge about the book or plot. It started well and I liked it although it ""twisted"" my mind a bit.Seemed to be about the second type (Copperfield) so even as it is a movie I believed that these ""tricks"" exist,not expecting to be given away. Then the shock with this ""clone"" idea.The movie changed its genre and every thought I had before was worthless.The movie became ""ridiculous""(thanks Jo) In the end I hoped the two guys might become friends invent a new sparkling machine to immortalize and call themselves Siegfried and Roy

13 May 2023,Overrated. Totally overrated.,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",6
26 October 2015,An exciting masterpiece,"The Prestige is one of my favorite films, for many reasons. There's something about the atmosphere in this movie that's just fantastic. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie at the same time as you get to enjoy the beauty of it all. This film, as most of Nolan's films have a great ""re-watch"" value so listen to the man in the film. - Watch closely.

The script is superb, with plot twisters and clever lines and really interesting characters. The way it's been shoot is marvelous, neatly balanced with light and shade. And the acting is in my opinion great too, you actually believe these characters. I think Nolan really did a great job on this film. And I absolutely would recommend it, to everyone!

19 January 2015,Best way to portray the script,"If anyone was given a chance at making this movie, I can assure you no one would come close to what has been done.

Christopher Nolan, well known for his Thriller movies with a 'unique' style of film-making has done justice to this script by directing it to the best of his abilities. His 'suspense' mechanism which gradually builds up in the film and leaves viewers baffled towards the end has done wonders yet again. Without spoiling too much, I'd say that the fact that the multiple twists in this plot made the movie even more exciting to watch. Every scene was shot perfectly and the closing scene brings goosebumps to anyone's body.

A must watch, if you love Thriller-themed movies with amazing plots.

28 August 2023,Jackman a 10 out of 10,"Never thought I'd write that. He overacts in most scenes of every film he's in, but occasionally his ""ham"" is exactly what's needed to carry a part, and this film fits beautifully.

Lovely cameos, not least from Michael Caine, who looks understated, and better for it, next to Jackman. But Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie also play their parts pitch perfectly.

The show is stolen by Christian Bale, though. He acts the whole cast off the set. A glorious baddie (or is he), with a sinister air of menace and madness.

Nolan is a class apart from most as a director, and he shows it here. What could've been a Vincent Price-esque piece of ""mock Baroque"" mystery is turned into a superior.

Smugly, I guessed the twist about two thirds the way through, but as Shakespeare knew, having the audience understand the forthcoming denouement well in advance doesn't ruin the drama - if anything it heightens the enjoyment of the moment the loser in this battle realises what he's failed to guess about the greatest trick.

Hopefully no spoilers there. Thoroughly enjoyable flick, that I can't believe it's taken me 17 years to catch up on.",10
1 July 2023,A Mesmerizing Tale of Obsession and Deception,"Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is an enthralling cinematic experience that combines the intrigue of magic with a complex narrative about obsession, sacrifice, and rivalry.

The film revolves around two magicians, brilliantly played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, whose competitive spirit spirals into a destructive obsession. Both actors deliver captivating performances, effectively capturing the intensity and desperation of their characters.

Nolan's direction is impeccable, expertly weaving the narrative's numerous twists and turns, and maintaining a sense of suspense throughout. The film's structure, mirroring the stages of a magic trick, further adds to the allure.

The themes of duality, sacrifice, and the cost of greatness are explored with depth and nuance, making 'The Prestige' much more than a typical period drama or thriller. The film's climax is a testament to Nolan's knack for narrative ingenuity, leaving the audience in awe and contemplation.

Overall, 'The Prestige' is a compelling blend of suspense, drama, and philosophical exploration. It's a shining example of Nolan's storytelling prowess, delivering a film that continues to astonish and provoke thought long after the initial viewing.",9

24 September 2012,The plot is too trickery; the payoff is flat,"Two magicians seek to revenge against each other, by trying to destroy each other. The premise is intriguing, but the delivery is trickery.

This is the Nolan brothers' movie that went a bit too labored. The plot is awkward, just like the walk of the Chinese magician (portrayed in the movie who did the goldfish trick), and the wisdom dispensed is too stretched (about ""sacrifice"") . Even its analogy about the audience seeking a moment of escape from the miserable world they are living in by going to see a magic show (as comparing to going to a movie) is a cliché.

The characters were mostly miscast, from the two leading roles (the magicians) to their women (Scarlett Johansson in particular). Not that those actors are not talent; just they are misfit for this early 20th century London scene. Only Michael Caine came cross creditable and convincing.

If this movie were a magic show, then, despite of the fanfare of all three acts-- Pledge, Turn and Prestige, the payoff for the audiences is as flat as the bird being snapped upon in the cage.",8
26 June 2013,Extraordinary work of mr Nolan,"Mr Nolan did it again.... add this extraordinary piece of genius with The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Ii had no expectation of this movie, and to be honest i don't remember knowing this movie existed...or perhaps i forgot. But this movie is a piece of ART and EXTRAORDINARY MASTER PIECE. Jonathan and Christopher helped write this and they were brilliant at it. Christian Bale the perfectionist actor, did it again, he was brilliant. The way they made this movie so that the viewers could escape to their fantasy world was incredible. With a twist at the end too, like the cherry on a cake. Brilliant, interesting, thrilling, entertaining tale. Well done at the whole team/cast for making this movie a masterpiece! A must watch if your a fan of Christopher Nolans work!!!!

3 November 2006,Surprisingly Excellent film,"Although The Prestige never really becomes a fast paced film until the climax, it isn't too slow either. More of a ""comfortable"" pace. It tells the story of two competitively good-natured magicians beginning their careers at the turn of the century. Their mutual respect soon turns to a bitter rivalry which escalades to dangerous levels.

Excellent acting all around, most surprisingly (at least to me) from David Bowie. A potentially confusing plot comes together seamlessly, leaving all your questions satisfied by the end. Many films like this can leave the audience confused if they weren't keeping a close eye on every scene, but The Prestige does not not suffer from this. Of course the keen observer will find the ending far more satisfying than the casual moviegoer, but the latter won't be left in the dark on anything. Indeed, this film rivals The Shawshank Redemption in terms of tying up loose ends.

22 October 2006,Nolan's best to date,"The Prestige was better than i expected, and i expected it to be good. It played out quite a bit differently from how i guessed it would from previews and what i'd read, etc. the rivalry between the magicians gets increasingly vicious and creates a great sense of impending doom again and again. It is hinted that there is a similar rivalry happening between Thomas Edison and Tesla (David Bowie) that i thought was a very nice touch. great performances from everyone, and even Scarlett Johanneson can't screw this one up.

I've enjoyed all his movies so far (especially Batman Begins and Following), and i'd have to say this is Christopher Nolans best to date. i'll admit i sorta went into this one just to see what these people have been up to between Batman movies, but i wasn't thinking about The Dark Knight at all when we left the theatre. This will also likely be one that improves upon multiple viewings i'm sure.

19 July 2018,Great entertainment.,"The Prestige is a great film by Christopher Nolan and it will take you probably more sittings than one to figure everything out. Strange that this came out the same year as the other film on magicians The Illusionist but I feel this one is a slightly better movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians who will go to any length to get the better of the other. The performances are good. The film is long but you wont feel so and the cinematography and production design are top notch.

11 November 2008,Awful !!!,"The movie lacks understanding. the characters are though jumbling from one scene to another but, unable to reach the conclusion. Hugh Jackman knows that Christian Bale is onlooking the task of stealing magic, but still he clarifies in the movie that he is the only one who can perform better magic. But at last he dies and Bale thinks he is alive. in the end Bale is only the survivor who lives and Hugh Jackman dies, but, in the actual view Bale is original villain who kills Jackman's wife and finds himself against Jackman. the story line is quite boring and if there are certain philosophical remakes in the movie, they are hidden and everyone thinks that performing magic is real task and prolongs killings. Michael Kane is the real idiot in the movie who goes around the stage and clarifies with the audience that Bale and Jackman are the only magicians who know how to perform magic.

7 February 2013,Like magic? This is the movie for you!,"This is so far the best movie I've seen in my life. I watched this expecting it to be a decent movie, but it wasn't, it's the BEST, in my opinion! IMO, it's also too underrated! I won't add a lot of information, but if you haven't seen this movie yet, and are reading these reviews first, and/or if you like magic, fantasy, and suspense thrillers, watch this movie ASAP. You will not regret it. It's worth it! By the way, make sure you don't read the plot/summary AT ALL. Even if you read a single line by mistake, it may be the suspense and you might spoil the movie for yourself! Also, make sure you watch this movie in complete silence. It's quite complicated, but trust me, don't stop! Continue watching it. It's honestly not a movie to watch on a party etc.

23 January 2007,"A great looking movie, almost too grim to recommend","If the misdirections in The Prestige are effective (and even if they aren't), the suspense, intrigue, and sometimes humor of competing illusionists can make for an entertaining story. I also enjoyed how the movie moved back-and-forth through different time points to keep me curious and interested. However, at the same time, the emotional effect of some of the underlying themes and metaphors and the way they were developed was pretty grim and unsettling. The most obvious (and effective) to me dealt with the existential costs of letting certain perceived inadequacies and vanities drive your obsessions. The beautifully rich and dark, and sometimes grotesque, tones of the Victorian and Colorado settings seemed to enhance those feelings and also made the movie appealing to look at. Some of the key plot differences from the book leave even less room for sympathy for some of the characters, yet somehow the overall effect still felt worth the experience.

20 March 2012,Best film I've seen since Inception! Magical story and spectacular acting!,"Brilliantly executed story and the acting is above superb. I had no doubt with the cast line up that the acting would be anything less than well, magical. This truly is the best film I've seen since Inception and I truly wonder why I have not heard more people going on about this film. Could it be too complicated for most audiences? I really hope that is not the case because the film is too extraordinarily awesome to go unseen. The only reason I didn't rate the film a 10 out of 10 is due to the complicated nature of the film. If it had been easier to understand, like Inception, which isn't all that easy, I would have given it that 10. At the same time, if the film was any simpler I don't know if it would be as mind blowing as it is. Thank you Mr. Nolan for another original and unusually fantastic ride!

22 October 2006,Best Movie That I've Seen Since Usual Suspects,"This is my first comment, or review of a movie, so bare with me.

The Prestige, this movie was EXCELLENT, gave it a 10, two thumbs up, best movie I've seen since Usual Suspects. Mad me want to go back in and watch it again, to catch clues. I'm not going to give up any spoilers because you should watch it on your own. I'm becoming a big fan of Christopher Nolan (have Memento, but never watched it, now later on tonight, I'm definitely going to watch it). His direction, just sweeps you into the movie until it lets you go at the end, and just has you saying what happened. When I first heard about him and Batman Begins, I said to myself, couldn't be any worse than Batman Forever. However, with the Prestige, the direction was great, and just keep you intrigued about it. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (Batman vs Wolverine, LOL, jokin)..just played just NASTY rivals until the end. You believe that these two actors truly just hated each other for reasons that you really understood. I'm not going to say this should be Oscar nominated and blah blah blah, however, it's a movie worth your time. It's a movie where you just feel you are right there, at that time set, in the audience watching the magician, watching these two wonderful actors, play out their roles.",10

Not only is this movie masterfully written, but the cast is great, and the performances are great. The movie is extremely clever and well directed. The Prestige will keep you guessing until the very end. The movie does run a bit long though, but, the movie is great that you can forgive it for its long run time.

The movie tells the story of two magicians and how they slowly become rivals. A war ensues between these two magicians, and the movie transitions to being centered around a specific magic trick. This movie is great, and is close to being a Masterpiece.

7 August 2023,Magical,"Set in the late 19th century, The Prestige follows the lives of two ambitious magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Their once-friendly partnership turns into a fierce competition when a tragic accident occurs during one of their performances, leading to an escalating game of one-upmanship that spans years. As the narrative unfolds, the film expertly weaves through multiple timelines, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats until the very last frame. One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its cast. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale deliver career-best performances, bringing unparalleled depth and intensity to their characters. Jackman's Angier exudes charm and desperation, while Bale's Borden portrays a complex man with secrets buried deep within. Their on-screen chemistry is captivating, intensifying the palpable tension between their characters. Michael Caine's portrayal of John Cutter, a seasoned stage engineer, provides a solid grounding to the story. His wisdom and moral compass serve as a guiding force in the face of the escalating rivalry. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall also deliver memorable performances, adding layers of complexity to the plot. Nolan's direction and storytelling prowess shine through The Prestige. The film explores themes of sacrifice, identity, and the relentless pursuit of perfection. Nolan's non-linear narrative style enhances the film's enigmatic atmosphere, mirroring the elusive nature of a magician's tricks. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is both thought-provoking and meticulously crafted, making it one of the most intelligent screenplays in modern cinema. The production design and cinematography are equally impressive, transporting the audience to the enchanting world of 19th-century London and the wondrous realm of magic. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the essence of each magic trick with mesmerizing visuals, further enhancing the film's mysterious allure. Furthermore, the film's underlying philosophical exploration of the concept of sacrifice and the blurred lines between illusion and reality leaves the audience pondering long after the credits roll. ""The Prestige"" is a testament to Nolan's ability to craft a gripping narrative that stays with you and prompts endless discussions.",9
15 February 2014,Keeps You guessing .........Blows your mind away.......Fantastic,"As a Christopher Nolan Fan i must tell you that this movie is a feather in a cap for him along with Inception and Dark Knight.

Absorbing performance from Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine. The movie keeps you guessing. You think he wins it, no he doesn't, oh again he does it but he didn't. It was a spectacle for me. This movie tells us human life is simple with no magic but when you do something tricky people wonder about it and appreciate it. Same thing applies for this movie. This movie just more personifies Nolan's Directorial talent. Expects him to give equally more good movies.

Hats Off......But how many....you will know it when you watch it.

22 March 2014,Review: The Prestige,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

22 October 2006,Saw it coming a mile away,"This comment is only based on the plot. I will leave the judgment of directing and cinematography and editing and score to you. However, if you are expecting a twist at the end, it is extremely weak, and guess what, you have already figured it out halfway throughout the movie. I will not tell you any spoilers, but be warned it was disappointing. If you are like me, you have probably seen the previews for this movie (and you liked the preview, I mean, why not? there are three good actors and an attractive female, and the movie is about performing magic? what is there not to like?) and you may have seen the Illusionist, which you may have liked and thus you are ready to see this mega movie, right? Even tough you will most likely NOT feel that this was a waste of money and or time, you will most likely be very disappointed. The reason is plain. The movie is unrevealing itself, however you already know that...so you wait to see the next unrevealing but you know that..so you wait to see the next unrevealing again, but there isn't. Disappointing and not worthy of thumbs up (as they say). I gave it a 7 because, well it is still a movie well done (except for the plot).

sadly disappointed.",6
30 July 2016,Bad,"I did not enjoy this movie nearly as much as I was expecting based on the hype. I gave it such a bad rating to balance the good ones.

It moved incredibly slowly, was overly predictable and repetitive, was *barely* redeemable by an exciting yet still BAD ending. It portrays magician performers as kind of lame and immature, not realistic and not relatable. There are some *really bad* actors that play minor roles in this movie. Overall the movie was cheesy and the dialogue is just plain bad. If there was no twist, this movie would have absolutely nothing entertaining about it.

Not recommended.

22 October 2006,An otherworldly great film,"The Prestige is a great film. It is wonderful, thought provoking, challenging, intense, mysterious, complex and sad. It has a great director, a great cast, incredible writing, fantastic production and once again, Christian Bale is exemplary. There are films that you say to yourself ""I will not see a better film this year"" or ""this is one of the best movies I have ever seen"". Thats the kind of film that this is. I hope that The Prestige finds great success because to me it is what a movie is all about, a transporting and moving experience. Its what I hope for every time I have the opportunity to see a new film. Go. Now. See it!

27 March 2016,Intriguing from start to finish,"The film opens up with a monologue by Michael Cain, surprisingly explaining how a magic trick or illusion is performed. Within minutes we are introduced to all the main character, which with nowadays movies, is rare. As the film unfolds the film seems to break and pull back the fourth wall, allowing the audience a ""behind the scene's"" if you will into the performance, forgetting that it's a film we are watching and not the performance. The acting and dialogue from all characters is second to none. The film leaves you deeply thinking with each scene , however the plot and ending (if you catch on early enough) are revealed during the opening to middle parts.

A very well written, performed and spoken film from Christopher Nolan.

25 March 2007,My big question....is...,"Which of the brothers died hanged in prison?The problem with The Prestige is that it so clearly lays out its plan to present its tale like the magic trick explained in the opening scene that we start to look immediately for what the Turn will be and what the Prestige will be. We are looking for the gimmick, and we can find it fairly early on. The press materials implore critics not to spoil the film by revealing the ""deceptions at the heart of the film."" But less than halfway through the film many viewers will experience that ""a-ha"" moment when all is clear. It's a moment of smug satisfaction that you have figured out the magician's secret coupled with the sad disappointment that you have not been fooled and now have to sit through the rest of the show with no surprises.

9 March 2011,Christopher Nolan's best Suspense masterpiece,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life... Christopher Nolan is simply superb.

The plus points in this movie are STORY, DIRECTION and PERFORMANCE... Before i watched this movie i was sure that ""I AM GOING TO LIKE THIS MOVIE""....... So i watched and the movie is full of twists...

There is no doubt that whoever watches this movie will be surprised by every twist...

Even though the whole movie is all about how Christian BALE and HUGH JACK MAN take revenge on each other, it is EXCELLENT.... And....... The people who haven't seen this movie WILL be shocked when they watch the ending....

I recommend this movie to everyone....

WHAT AN ENDING!!!!! 10/10",10
20 October 2006,This movie is a boon to magicians everywhere! I highly recommend it!!!,"I went to this movie with high hopes and high expectations. Being a magician myself I was a little wary that the director would not show the true life of a magician. I was not let down. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were wonderful as magicians. Even the eccentric David Bowie was amazing as the scientist Tuslo. At the beginning of the movie we find that Christian Bale is being put on trial for the murder of his fellow magician Hugh Jackman. It then goes back in time and shows you the real reasons that Hugh Jackman and Christian were fighting. When Hugh's wife dies during an act I was very proud of the director. This event was like that of Harry Houdini who died after performing such a trick. If you love murder, a good story, and a good old fashioned rivalry I highly recommend this movie.

16 February 2013,What the heck,"The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the best and clever movies I've seen in a long time. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two rival magicians who will do whatever it takes to show each other up. Both of these two actors play their characters very well.

Why did I like the Prestige so much? Well, it is like Inception, in a way one of my all time favourite movies, also directed by Christopher Nolan. It is very clever and unpredictable, with lots of twists you'll never see coming. It's genius. The sets are all very believable, all the magic tricks are cool, and it is acted very well. Particular props go to Hugh Jackman.

The Prestige is great. It's one of those movies you'll be thinking about for a while after you see it. The ending is so confusing, hence the caption of this review. It has a great story and it translates beautifully onto screen. And I think, as a viewer, that's what matters the most.",9

21 July 2007,Everything about this movie was poor,"The Prestige was an overblown piece of rubbish. The acting was third-rate. The caricature accents were ridiculous. Christian Bale a cockney - I don't think so.

Scarlett Johnanssen, she didn't do anything other than pout. We would ask for more from a big budget movie actress.

David Bowie, why didn't you open your mouth when you were talking. You are not a cartoon. You are a real person - or pretending to be.

Hugh Jackman, well you were just like High Jackman - likable, but nothing special.

After the thrilling Memento, (also directed by Nolan) this was a sorely disappointing film. Seriously, for sadists only!

29 May 2015,Good movie..but I don't think angier really dies like most people think .,"Angier might not be dead.I know its an abrupt beginning to an opinion but there it is.after returning from the jail meeting with bordon angier meets cutter.here when or before the jail sequence something happened that is not shown in the movie properly because it is supposed to be like an easter egg.angier discovers bordons secret somehow.he then realises that though he was able to kill one of them(fallon,he gets hanged) he is not completely safe.in my opinion angier used the machine one last time.after cutter left he had just enough time before bordon arrived,only this time he ENDS UP BEING ""THE MAN IN THE BOX"". As the movie ends and the narration says YOU ARE NOT REALLY LOOKING its clearly shown that there is another angier in a water filled box except he is not one of those who have drowned before because you can clearly see bubbles going up inside the box as the movie ends.

There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie.I actually found it very clever and boring im afraid at times.it does have a great story, amazing cast. But its the screenplay which is both commendable and ""yawn""able at times. The story always shows this fallon following bordon and the wanted avoidance to show who this character ist so fooling for me. i was able to figure it out halfway through the movie.so it was falling back a bit for me.the stitching of the scenes in the first half was a bit patch but it becomes really enchanting as the story progresses. All being said it was a good time killer for me.",7

29 October 2006,good technique but still a bit disappointing,"Don't get me wrong. The acting was superb. Jackman, Bale, Caine, Johansson and the rest of the cast gave admirable performances. Visually, the movie was stimulating but the culmination was so-so. And sure I wouldn't weigh it so much but I must, because this is a thriller, so the resolution is considerably important. Maybe I had too high of an expectation. I absolutely enjoyed Memento. Loved it. I guess I was expecting something of the same intensely witty mind blowing resolution. The other reason it receives a rather low score for me is that the movie runs a bit long and lags at certain points both plot wise and clue-dropping wise. But if you don't mind a fairly uninspiring resolution and can pay attention through the rather slow portions of this movie, by all means go watch it. It is a wonderfully captured and edited movie with wonderful acting. It is definitely thought provoking and you will leave the theater discussing the twists of the movie. The question is- will you be discussing it in a disappointed manner or an enthralled manner? All in all it was decent.

Multiple viewings are mandatory to see things you missed the first time and for affirmations of what you think are the facts. He and his brother did a great job of adapting a brilliant,fascinating,complex novel of rivalry and obsession that has no limits into a nice movie.Delve deeper in some scenes and all is not what is seems .Some of the critics reviews complain that there is rooting interest for the audience you really don't care for either character. I totally disagree with that I found myself rooting for and against Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale ) at various times throughout . This movie is one of my favorites of the year.

Bale's and Jackman's best film and best acting yet. All the acting was on point and it only added to the great storyline, great plots, and great characters. And it didn't leave not one plot hole and for a movie like this that's is an amazing feat.

The movie keeps you right on the edge of your seat the whole way right up until the end. You will never see what's coming and thats why its so shocking. I would rank this movie with the best of the best, and thats including Saw II.

This is a MUST SEE!

I will definitely be seeing this movie a third or fourth time.",10
24 January 2007,An Original Movie,"Spoilers:

The Prestige focuses on the blood feud between American abroad Robert Angier (Jackman) and Cockney Alfred Borden (Christian Bale).

They're introduced as ""volunteers"" picked from an English music hall audience to bind magician's assistant Julia (Piper Perabo). Plunged into a water tank, she miraculously escapes. In fact, the two young men are apprentice magicians, secretly a part of the act. Further, Julia is wife to personable Robert. He's a natural showman, while taciturn Alfred is a more gifted illusionist.

But in the name of slick presentation, Alfred takes risks that don't pass muster with safety-minded mentor Cutter (Michael Caine). One day, Alfred ties a more-difficult yoke with Julia's permission that results in her being unable to free herself; she drowns before an ax can break the glass tank.Robert is enraged and inconsolable,particularly when he spies Alfred with new wife, Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and baby,the happy family he feels robbed of.

The men develop separate acts, with Robert's successful while Alfred toils in dives. Nonetheless, Robert remains consumed by thoughts of vengeance. What starts out an exchange of petty humiliations turns into vicious, increasingly violent one-upmanship.

Seeing Alfred perform a stupendous act called ""The Transported Man,"" Robert vows to steal it. When he's unable to figure it out himself, he dispatches on stage assistant and offstage lover Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to seduce the secret from his rival. This central chronology is interspersed throughout with dual flash-forward threads. In one, Robert travels to Colorado Springs to petition reclusive inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a machine like the transport he supposedly built for Alfred. In the other thread, Alfred stands trial for the death of Robert, whom we've seen drown just like his late wife.

This movie actually turned out better than I had expected. Jackman, Bale and Johansson did a particularly good job. Overall, this movie's definitely worth seeing. A few twists in the end will leave you in awe, but you'll love it just the same. Great acting, original plot, amazing magic tricks revealed and not boring at all. If you enjoyed watching ""The Illusionist"", you will not be disappointed.

Highly recommended. 8/10",8

The entire show is an eye candy. The problem, however, lies in the script. When I finished watching the movie, I had a few ""WTF?"" questions burning, but then I picked up the book and got really confused.

It is a wonderful book, but what could possibly move the director to make such drastic changes to the script and completely reverse the ending? Really, if he would keep at least somewhat close to the book, the end product could have been so, so many times better. Great potential, great expectations, under-delivered.

Christopher Nolan has yet again outdone himself with this mystery filled, time-warped wonder. The characters are rich and complex. the storyline although hard to follow on a first watch, is delightfully challenging. And the dialogue contains some words of wisdom many viewers might take with them long after leaving the theater. I recommend this film to a lover of magic, any hopeless romantic, and children of all ages.

21 October 2006,I thought it was excellent.,"I thought it was excellent. You know those movies, where the previews are amazing, and then the movie sucks? This wasn't one of them. I wasn't disappointed in any aspect. For some reason I always compare movies to their trailers, because the trailers always make the movie look so amazing, and mysterious, and suspense filled, and usually the previews are better than the movies. This movie was...well..I'll just say I wasn't disappointed AT ALL, like I usually am when I go to the movies.

It was very intense, especially when things were revealed near the end. So much so that some people in the theatre could barely stay in their seats. I've never seen people so wrapped up in a movie until last night.

The story was great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were all great, and I didn't find any of the acting to be wooden. The cinematography was wonderful, the camera work was wonderful. I was slightly confused at some points, (the movie also takes place in several layers of time) and there are a lot of questions that aren't answered until the end of the movie, unless you're a good problem solver. Most of the people I was with were able to solve some things.

I'm taking a film course this year, and our teacher is making us write a review for ""Lone Star."" Well...I didn't like that movie to begin with, but now I wish more than ever that we could have chosen our own films, because I would definitely have more positive and insightful things to say about ""The Prestige."" To sum things up, I thought this movie was excellent, and definitely worth the $10 dollars go get in. I may see it again before it's out of theatres.",10
22 October 2011,Classic tale of rivalry and vengeance,"Very few words can be used to describe this film, in every aspect of this movie it portrays that of the enticing idiosyncratic feeling that will blow your mind.I was pleased at how well the characters held their own in this movie they contributed a great deal and they did not disappoint in that respect.

Christopher Nolan I must say you are a genius who eclipsed the way movies are meant to be made.A well written script to support a lead of desirable events that take place with the sort of impression that will be imprinted in the minds of anyone who appreciates the arts.Thumbs up to the cast as well as everyone who was involved in the production of this film.

It will certainly be placed in my category of films of the decade.

7 January 2007,A very good movie!!,"I saw the trailer and just thought you gotta see that movie!! Especially because I also love to see and perform magic. The story of the movie is very exciting, but at first I was confused as in the movie there were several times used and that was kind of confusing. But as the story was very good and there were often sudden changes and surprises. I would advise everybody to watch the movie who wants to see an exciting thriller and also dramatic story about success and how the people change if they got success. One thing which is kind of confusing that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackmann are enemies but have a really similar outer appearance therefore sometimes you ask yourself who is that because you can't say who it is from the behind. As already said all in all it's a very good movie.

14 July 2013,Just the greatest!,"After a long time i have seen a creative movie like this. ""Are you watching closely? Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. A deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it, to see that it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But, of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be... fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act. The hardest part. The part we call... ""the prestige."""". These are the first quotes of this movie and you will agree that it bears a certain allure and if I am not wrong you are going to watch the movie...

10 September 2023,"Good, but contradictory","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations.

23 October 2006,"Watchable, but too predictable","I'd have liked it a lot more if only I hadn't figured things out early on in the show. Far too many clues were given - at least for me. Scarlett Johansen though was stunning. All the acting was very good, and the sets were great. Quite watchable, just not very surprising.

David Bowie did a fine job (heck, I didn't even recognize him). The outdoor scenery was excellent. The interiors sets were very accurate for the period/location - both the style and ""upkeep"" - in fact, I think it deserves an Oscar for the sets.

All the actors and actresses did an excellent job, even the twins who played the little girl - I expect we'll see more of them in the years to come.

12 March 2011,Magical,"I have to say that I was a moderate fan of Nolan's work before seeing this movie. I bought the Blu-Ray edition last month so I had seen Inception, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight way before this movie. Now I enjoyed both Batman movies and absolutely loved Inception, but when I started watching this movie, it just caught my attention in a way that when it ended, it felt like it was only 15-minutes long. now I find myself ""tearing"" movie stores upside-down to see all Nolan's work.

With this movie it's evident why Nolan likes to work with Michael Caine (one of the best in the movie) and I had the opportunity to see Hugh Jackman in a different way, rather than smoking cigars and clawing everything in the way. Absolutely loved his performance. Let's not forget, however, Christian Bale, which, in my opinion, performed greater than in Batman Begins and Dark Knight. The story is very addictive and easily understandable and has some memorable moments. If you ever seen ""The Illusionist"", with Edward Norton, and you liked it, you'll be blown away with ""The Prestige"".

Oh and the ending? Absolutely fantastic.

Truly a ""must"" for every Nolan fan, and for everyone who loves a great movie.",10

25 January 2007,Irresponisble to Post Spoiler comments in the HEADLINE that appears - !,"Nice, thanks a lot! If you someone hasn't seen the film, your posting's subject line, which everyone sees, destroys A LOT. I just wanted to thank you for that. Very inconsiderate. It seems pretty obvious, don't post spoilers in the main message area where anyone and everyone will see that. Hey, Brainiac, GUESS WHY THEY CALL THEM SPOILERS? You see, without thinking, you post, and then, innocently, hundreds of readers only browsing the SUBJECT/HEADLINE of posts, sees your text that SPOILS the film for anyone reading it. Hence, SPOILER. Get it? Hope so... Come on people, I thought these boards sort of weeded out the borderline idiots. Registration is purposely a bit cumbersome to lose the half-wits who aren't even able to complete the process. But, it seems like every once a while, a few get lucky! STOP POSTING SPOILERS - IT'S NOT COOL, SMART OR FUNNY... RT-Prague

12 June 2020,One of Nolan's best,"From the beginning of this film there are little lines of dialogue which will set up the entire plot which unfolds in the craziest and most astounding way it possibly could. It's probably my favourite plot twist and general ending of all time it has some great performances specifically Hugh jackman. This film will shock u to ur core and u won't be able to forget about it

23 October 2006,"Let's be a bit more objective about this, shall we?","Let me start my review by saying that I enjoyed this movie. It was a thoroughly entertaining 2+ hours, and I certainly did not leave the theater feeling like I did not get my $10's worth. However, in reading some of the other reviews here, I feel as though I need to say something about the obvious flaws in this movie.

Christopher Nolan is a very good director/writer, however, this is not one of his best and certainly does not display the genius we saw in his other works, such as Momento. There were a number of twists and turns in this story, but in the end, the outcome was a bit predictable. I also felt that the movie was a bit too long for the outcome and even found myself a bit bored at some points.

Visually, The Prestige is beautiful and warrants a 10/10 review solely based on this. However, the screenplay and the acting falls short in my eyes. Most notably - I absolutely love Scarlett Johansen, but this movie seemed to be a bit above her abilities, or she otherwise was eclipsed by the acting abilities of the rest of the cast.

Bottom Line: Don't be deceived by all of the glowing reviews. While The Prestige is worth your time and your money, don't expect to exit the theater thinking that this is one of the best movies you've seen this year.",7
20 February 2021,Solid drama,"The prestige is about two driven magicians who compete with themselves on every level, but whose envy for each other cause them to be blind to how they pull of their best acts. They fail to recognize the personal sacrifice the other had to give to pull off their act, and in so doing were just as blind as their audiences putting their focus on the wrong things.

The dangerous lengths they go through to find out how the other pulls it off eventually costs them both gravely.

A high suspense drama definitely worth the watch.

27 November 2006,Excellent Film,"Am I the only film fan who thinks Michael Caine improves with age? Some of his earlier films are now downright embarrassing!

I confess that I felt a little bit cheated during the early scenes in this film. I felt that there were unnecessarily complex scenes which did not seem to move the plot along. In retrospect they were probably simply building character etc. But after the first half hour or so we settled to some fascinating insights into these two complex characters.

The whole plot was built up beautifully, with clues to the final 'denouement' that would have had Miss Marple chuckling, and no, I did not see the triple twist coming. I saw the water tank one quite early on and sat congratulating myself that I had 'worked it out'.

Congratulations to the writer for having a twist that had me kicking myself for not seeing coming! I am recommending this film to all my friends.

1 March 2008,Untrue to the novel and really bad taste,"Typical Hollywood movie and a complete ruin to the novel true meaning. In few words, what a bunch of emptiness which give you a really bad taste to the people who has read the novel. Yes, good entertainment for all the wrong reasons. I don't know how the original writer let this movie to be out maybe his dark side took over him when the screenplay was shown to him. Ending different to Novel, showing that Hollywood doesn't care about moral values anymore like having more blood in your hands is better. Plus many discrepancies along the movie related to the original novel. I never expected to be similar to the novel because it is just a movie but at least I was expecting to keep similar contest related to the novel. I wouldn't advice watching this movie with your children or family because it will send the wrong signal and set of moral values to the young ones. The novel was more meaningful because it take you to the whole stage of friendship, rivalries, competition, vengeance, repentance, and spiritual awareness. The violent final just show,like this year Oscar that blood and violence pay and let's forget about teaching real values to the kids. Killing is better and vengeance evens more without any self repentance. If we keep rating so well this novel adaptation there won't be novel adaptation but completely new stories claiming to be from from books just to sell better. I wonder if the Lord of the Ring adaptation to the big screen would have been made like this movie, I would not go anymore to cinema to watch new novel adaptations knowing that they just would be a big disappointment. The 3 points I gave was just for acting of the main character because indeed they did a great performance, but that is all",6
24 May 2009,A movie that keeps you hooked to your seat till the last minute.,"This movie was quite different from the kinds Hollywood is making all these days. First things First, it was quite a confusing at the start. but each and every minute of this will be worth watching after you reach the end of this movie. the cast was very cleverly selected and the best part of this was the fusion of conventional magic with the science. the best part of this movie was of course it's PRESTIGE, the term coined by magicians for the ending of any trick. every minute of this drama is put down in black and white towards the last 10 minutes of the movie. the twins, the fingers been cut, generation of clones through TESLA's machine, killing the original performer every night. it was fun watching this. overall i would rate this movie at 8.5/10. well a deduction of 1.5 points because there were some things which could have been less complicated.

31 January 2012,Winner by a margin,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.

1 July 2013,"Suspenseful, stylish and intelligent.","I was quite interested to see The Prestige, I don't see how you couldn't be with such a great cast and director attached to it. The premise is what completely sold me. I don't think there's enough movies about magic, it can be bad if not done right, but when it's done right I just fall in love, it's just such an interesting subject. The Prestige is a magic movie done right. I love it.

The film is about two magicians referred to as Angier and Borden, the two men were once partners and good friends, but after a horrible accident their relationship quickly fades. They're both both brilliant magicians, but Angier knows how to present himself and his tricks with style, and Borden doesn't. Borden is smarter then Angier however, and he constructs the most brilliant trick Angier has ever seen. Angier becomes obsessed with finding out the logic behind his trick, so he himself can perform this trick with the style that he is able to present with, making him the better magician.

One thing that The Prestige does well with is magic, which you would expect from a film about magic but some films about magic don't get the whole thing right. What The Prestige does to make magic work well in the film is give logic behind the tricks, if it didn't do that the film would be nowhere near as good as it is. It just adds an extra layer of quality to the film.

What I loved the most about The Prestige however was it's story and characters. The story is written with skill and intelligence, it's mind bending and sometimes challenging, but not to the point where you're lost and uninterested as the twists and turns start happening, you just need a good attention span to get the story. The film makes you think, but it never goes overboard with its complexity. The characters of the film are very interesting and believable. I found myself stuck as to who I was rooting for throughout the film, which one was actually the good guy, or even if either of them are the good guy. This is obviously the sign of well written characters.

These well written characters would be pointless however if the characters weren't well portrayed. Luckily in this case, they are very well portrayed. Everyone in the film is great, can't really fault anyone if I'm honest. I'd say the best out of the bunch was Christian Bale (Borden) though, but Hugh Jackman (Angier) was still very good nevertheless. Even all the supporting actors give above average performances in the film.

The film nails a really great tone throughout. It has a consistent atmosphere all the way through, it's dark and mysterious. The film is a period piece, and its sets and costumes really capture the feeling of the time. The striking cinematography is also a big help to that too.

The Prestige is another brilliant mind bender from Christopher Nolan. If you're a fan of Nolan I'm sure you'll be pleased with this fantastic film.",9
15 July 2021,The Best Film Ever Made,"Just watch it... the cast, the acting, the writing, the direction are all flawless. A film about magicians really didn't sound like my cup of tea, but this immediately became my favourite film a few years ago and nothing has topped it since. Nolan's best work, which is saying something.

I'll start as I began... JUST WATCH IT!

18 August 2018,"Well conceptualized and executed, a magical panorama","1.Genre- drama, mystery

2. Rating- 7.5/10

3. One liner- Greatly entertained till the end, story line is quite unpredictable till the end. Well created by director Nolan

4. Plot summary- Story revolves around two magicians Mr. Alfred Borden and Mr. Robert Angier who fight to outcast other over the trick of illusion and magic. To prove one dominant over other. And they ought to loose on the path while doing it.

5. Events- The magic trick shown by Mr. Angier at the end when he used the machine created by Tesla mixing both science and magic

6. Film making- 1800's era was well conceptualized along with all the costume work. It was commendable. And of course the famous dialogue there are three stages of magic!!- The pride where you show something ordinary, The turn- where you turn the ordinary into extraordinary and last is the prestige that is for the audiences to define!!

7. Potential viewers- I guess who are well familiar with Christopher Nolan movies along with a top notch star cast. And to those who want to be amazed till the end.

8. Verdict- Thumbs up!!",7
14 June 2018,Didn't Enjoy It As Much As I'd Hoped,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is amazing, it's well directed, the scenes are flawless, the magic is incredible, but it was far from what I had expected which is what perhaps left me filled with negative affections towards the film.

After watching Dunkirk and Inception by the same, amazing director of The Prestige- Christopher Nolan- I expected something brilliantly made, and it is. It is fantastically made and the movie looks amazing.

The issues with the film I have, lie within the characters. I didn't feel as though there was much growth in these characters. Angier and Borden both seem the exact same at the beginning of the film towards the end.

I like Angier at the start of the film, not like Borden as much, and ended the movie not liking either of them. The only character I really cared about was the character played by Scarlett Johansson who's character name I don't really care to remember.

I just felt like neither of the two main leads developed or changed. Angier was bitter from beginning to end, and Borden just grew to become bitter and I can't stand the fact that they do have any redeeming qualities in my eyes.

The movie was enjoyable other than this, and I will continue to watch Christopher Nolan's films in the future, as he is talented. However, so hope his future films involve more character growth and have qualities that make them likeable that aren't outweighed by bad qualities.",8
27 June 2018,Mindblowing !!!!,"The movie is so awesome that i have watch thrice and it never bores me.The pace of the movie is very good.It doesnt bore you and you have a feeling that something is gonna happen and it happens!!!The end of the movie is just amazing and it turns the movie upside down.One of the best of Cristopher Nolan

20 September 2022,The Prestige: Christopher Nolan,"I'm not sure how he does it every time, but Christopher Nolan could be the one and only so called the mastermind of movies in the 21st century. Christopher Nolan again amazes me with this masterpiece, whenever we see the word ""directed by Christopher Nolan"", that ladies and gentlemen is the minute you know this is going to be a great work. One of the greatest things i noticed in every Christopher Nolan movie is that there might be a certain pattern for him when choosing the cast member because they always end up being the greatest of all time. That is why i keep wondering how he almost every time ends up choosing the greatest of actors, i mean Michael Caine and Christian Bale as well as Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. It's just 10/10 for me.

29 October 2006,"Remarkably smart, yet sadly dark","In many ways this film is about duality and extremes, and that theme also carries over into audience reaction. What works about this movie works brilliantly -- excellent cast and acting, intricate plot with lots of twists and turns to keep you engaged and entertained.

Yet what doesn't work about this movie fails in a way that is difficult to overlook. The ""big secret"" is unexplained, unexplored and a bit too far out there to really be believed. In a way it almost feels like the writers created this wonderful maze, but in the end couldn't figure out a plausible way to get out of it and resolve the storyline. The final ""twist"" is disappointingly dumb in comparison to the intelligence with which the majority of this beautifully twisty turny plot is constructed.

The other incongruity of this film that is difficult to reconcile is that the elaborate dueling of the magicians is great fun for the audience -- wondering and guessing at the tricks, what they will do next. But the obsessive competitiveness between the men themselves - the motivation behind their cleverness - is NOT fun. It's dark and sad, as both men simply sink deeper into heartless one-upsmanship, inflicting more and more damage, neither of them pausing, reflecting, or regretting -- neither learning anything.

That's why it's hard to know what to make of this film -- remarkably smart and satisfying on some levels, yet disappointingly cheap and heartless on others.",7
12 July 2007,"""im part of the act""","big Christian bale fan, this was the only reason i watched the film as from reading the back cover i wasn't convinced, i dislike films of this genre.

I was pleasantly surprised, as always bale's performance was awesome. His ability to mimic accents from different regions is undulated. the story line is a bit slow but i definitely recommend trying to get your head into this particular film as the ending is one of the best endings i have seen.

Jackman also provides the goods, a very convincing act.

ill definitely watch out for more Chris Nolan flicks.

14 November 2006,An amazingly well-thought out film lost in imperfect retelling,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

20 November 2006,"A damn good tale, well told.","This movie is a tale. A story. A complete fantasy, but one in which some vital exposé's of what make us all human are on display. The frailties which make us what we are and the sacrifices we'll make in order to get hold of, and hold on to, that which we desire most.

I'm not going to relate the plot line here. I will however encourage readers to go see the film. It is an absolute cracker from both an acting perspective and an intriguing, suspense-filled drama fest between the main actors, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine makes a return to the type of film which suits him most now. The drama genre. A surprise addition and a very, very attractive one too, is the inclusion of a well matured David Bowie playing a pivotal role which makes brief, yet contextually important appearances. Bowie is by far the tantaliser role and a well played one at that.

In the style of the director's other films Batman Begins, Insomnia and Momento, time lines are jumbled and the story jumps forward and back between the present and the past. The time shifting doesn't, however, detract from the telling of the story. To the contrary. I found the movement back & forth in time enhanced the movie's ability to entrance it's audience and build suspense. It's the toying with the audience which the director has clearly set out to do, and he achieves his aim admirably. I strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen this flick to do so. You won't guess the ending. It'll leave you stunned. This film rates an 8 out of 10 from me.",8

13 June 2017,Interesting story,"The Prestige is a 2006 British-American mystery thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay adapted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Its story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, and Rebecca Hall. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, film score composer David Julyan, and editor Lee Smith.

The film was released on October 20, 2006, receiving positive reviews and strong box office results, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction.

The plot lines are so complex, it steals your attention. The performance by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine stole the scene. And the man to give real credit for The Nolan Brothers WOW!!! their screenplay are Oscar worthy. The story of the two rival magicians who are obsessed with their craft fights to get the best spot. But the screenplay is so huge that it boils down to the fight of their personal gains. It explores human obsession to not let it go and the tragic result of that. Human conflicts and emotions, Imagination and not able to imagine,creative and creative .It inspired me hope it inspires you.

24 April 2015,"A lot of tricks revealed, but not much of story","Nice attempt to pictures the rivalry among contemporary magicians of old times.

Throughout the movie there are many popular magic tricks which you will know how they are done. That was only thing to keep you interested.

I would have been happier if movie was more about its story rather than ""how to do this trick"" lesson.

Though there is nice script and nice acting. Nice picturization of the level of commitment, the magicians show for developing an illusion and the limits they can go to do that. ................... .................. ....................... ...................... ....................

22 October 2006,Tedious. Convoluted.,"The movie was slow moving. Unduly complex, as the the competing magicians tried to outdo each other and learn the other's secrets. The audio was terrible as I had a hard time figuring out their mumbling diction. The movie was too long. It could have been finished in under 100 minutes.

The acting was good and the movie was well cast. Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson do a good job but Scarlett's fate was left unexplained and she just disappeared from the screen. The score was just mediocre and the direction could be a little crisper. Movies set in England in the 19th century have a dark hue which I suppose is required to depict the truth but it leaves me depressed.

The way Nolan can achieve storytelling at this level and still wow the audience makes him one of the greatest directors of all time.

Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine all delivers career defining performances (which tells a lot when it comes to them) but I just think that Rebecca Hall just don't get the attention she deserves. What a performance. Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie also with excellent contributions.

Wow, wow, wow. What a movie, it's so freaking good really.

19 February 2007,"Great Story, Lifeless Acting","The Prestige, the newest film from acclaimed director Christopher Nolan(Memento, Batman Begins) is an extremely well written and thought provoking film that makes the viewer think about what is happening in the film. It is a film that may require multiple viewing for a complete understanding of the story. As far as scenery and production, the film succeeds on all levels. That being said, the film's biggest flaw is this: the acting is wooden. While the characters are well written and developed, the actors fail to convey any sort of emotional pull for their characters. The two leads, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, are both talented actors, a fact which is not in doubt. However, their performances fail to captivate the audience to care what happens to them. Michael Caine gives as usual a capable performance, but his character really doesn't affect anything. The same goes for David Bowie. Scarlett Johansson is wasted as Jackman's assistant who abandons him for Bale. She comes off as a gold-digging woman who doesn't really love either of the two magicians. The film's ending is clever, but to have been great, it would have required for the audience to still care about the fates of the two leads. The fact of the matter is that the film has a great script, as well as great direction by Nolan, but both are wasted by wooden, mediocre performances.",7
23 October 2006,"Great film, lacked focus","I thought the movie itself keeping all logicality aside was a very good film, however I found it contradicted itself in the movie. On one hand the movie was talking about how there was always an answer to magic , however the whole re-making of oneself put into the movie totally contradicted itself . That wasn't logical and impossible. I found the way the whole movie was put together very well, however it should have stuck to one main theme. I would still recommend seeing this movie, you won't feel bored, however, it doesn't have a strong idea. The flow of the movie is very good, and the ending extremely well done. Definiatley one of the best movies i have seen this past year.

It has it all and I felt from this film that Nolan really did set the bar so high. As the viewer we are given enough but not to much to spoil , Its the perfect balance every movie needs but is so hard to achieve , it very rarley happens .

The acting is incredible and jackman in fantastic the plot is so good and so detailed right to the very end . As far as films go he couldnt have made this one any better hence the 10/10 rating a film about two magicians that has such a moral dilemma and twist that we could be watching a film on conspiracies in the American justice system .

31 July 2013,Two magicians on the edge of obsession,"The film prestige"" is set in London centers around two rivaling magicians in the late 19th century. The budding performers Robert Angier and Alfred Borden both work for the engineer Cutter, who creates the machinery for their tricks. Competition between the two men advances and a dispute arises when Borden's suggestion to use an alternate knot tying technique for one of their tricks is rejected by Angier and Cutter. The collaboration between the two magicians experiences a definite rupture when Angier's wife, assistant to a dramatic trick on stage, drowns in a water tank as she is unable to untangle herself in time from a knot Borden had tied. Angier blames Borden for his wife's death and is increasingly filled with bitterness as he observes his contestant living a seemingly happy life with wife and daughter and at the same time challenging his fame as a magician. The two magicians closely track one another's shows and are gradually more daring to use dirtier techniques in order to damage one another's status as a magician. While Angier is sided by Cutter, Borden has his own mentor, Fallon, with whom he develops dangerous and at the same time ingenious tricks. Having started from rough living conditions, Borden advances to an increasingly successful performer with a yet uncontested show demonstrating his own disappearance and reappearance. Angier, unable to grasp the secret behind Borden's performance, seeks help from the scientist Tesla in the USA and returns with his own interpretation of the ""transported man"". The two opponents have in common their desire for prestige and fascination for magic. These traits increasingly degenerate into an obsession, leading to an alienation from reality and, in the end, demanding a high price.

As introduced at the beginning of the film, each trick has three parts, the pledge, where an ordinary object is presented to the audience; the turn, where the object is turned into something unexpected; and the prestige, where the object is brought back. In seeking uncontested prestige in the life of magic, Angier and Borden experience, that in real life, once lost, some things cannot be brought back. Christopher Nolan's film depicts a dark side of the world of magic in which magicians have to go far in order to gain admiration and amazement from the audience, which expects more than a simple trick.",8
29 March 2023,One of the best movies I have ever seen,"I watched this movie only 3-4 years ago, without knowing the story, just this was about magicians and that's all. What a surprise... the first time, I didn't even remember if there was music into the movie, because I was so absorbed by the plot... plot extremelly well brought, minutes after minutes you discover a piece of the puzzle. This isn't just about magic and tricks at all, but about obsessions and secrets, and how they impact your life. I had to watch the movie several times to have a different understanding of the story and the characters, like an onion skin, each time a new layer. The ambience, colours and textures are beautiful, and the music links everything together in a very subtle manner. If you don't know this movie yet, watch it !

19 January 2022,"Personally, I like the challenge.","I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",
1 August 2008,nolan is definitely one of the best director,"this movie is one of the best movies of 2006.the story is gripping, soundtrack is good,casting is thoughtful and above all the direction is so perfect.

the reason why i rank nolan so highly is that he also writes his movies.not only the stories are good , fresh and interesting there are so many question to ponder about , thoughts thrown at you. and you savour the taste long after you have finished the movie.

prestige is best work after memento till now. its a story about two magicians,how they were friends before which turned into a rivalry which ultimately becomes deadly. both of the actors, hugh jackman and bale plays their role so smoothly as if they were also enjoying and at the same time feeling proud of this movie.the part of the movie where jackman meets tesla are amazing. the visuals are so realistic.nothing overdone.

its a must watch movie and a collectors item. i also recommend you to see all of nolan's movies.",8
30 August 2021,Another masterpiece by Nolan,"I really regret because of discovered this epic movie too late.

I think this movie is one of the underrated movies.

It could be seen this movie is boring but I absolutely didn't get bored while watching it (expect of 10 minutes).

When I finished this movie. Even though the movie was over, my curiosity didnt stop and I started researching at 3.30 am. Everythime When I learned somethingnew background I woke up more and my curiosity was increasing. So if you watch this movie I think you should make researching a little bit. That's gonna add even more meaning to the movie.

You will say ""doesn't it have bad sides"" it does but these errors not very noticeable.

Finally this are my thoughts you can agree or not!",10
24 August 2021,Annoyingly predictable,"This is a movie I kept seeing show up on lists of awesome thrillers but it was so predictable you can tell very early on what's happening. The 'twists' at the end are literally spoon fed to you throughout the movie. They're glaringly obvious. The only thing worse is the accents Hugh and Scarlett try to pass off! Thank goodness for Christian Bale. The intensity he brings made this barely watchable. I kept waiting, hoping the twists wouldn't be that obvious but, they were. Would love to read the book to see if the original creator of this story does a better job of hiding the 'twists.'

P. S this is my first review. I'm tired of these movies and their IMDB sucking me in only to waste another 2 hours on predictable crud! I'm not doing it anymore! If you've got half a brain this isn't the movie for you.

26 February 2011,Are YOU watching closely?!,"Christopher Nolan is a genius, I must say. You'll find this movie on anyone's favorite list, given that they've watched this movie. I, for one, wasn't very keen on watching this movie. But when I did, believe me when I say this, it shook me down to the core. I never write spoilers and never do I tell people in my reviews who's doing what in the movie. I concentrate mainly on what as we, as viewers as well as humans, take out of the movie. And there's a lot you can take out of this movie. It teaches you how jealousy makes you forget the difference between good and bad. How in anger one gets so blinded that while trying to hurt others one hurts himself, and the people he loves, the most. Christian Bale is stupendous in this movie, one thing I can't stop blabbering bout.

Anyway, back to the movie again, somehow people might say that the movie's ending was the best part. On the contrary, I believe that once you're through the movie and if you critically analyze the movie you'd realize that the parts in between were the most fascinating parts. I must say it was written so finely that everything makes sense to the viewer.

I rate this movie as one of the most defining movies of the decade and it defines the man who made this movie. To sum it all, if you watch it WATCH IT CLOSELY!",10
26 September 2010,The best movie experience,"I must have watched this movie a 100 times bye now... its an awesome experience and shows the pure genius in Nolan. The movie is perfect in the sense it has a great story, portrayed by an immensely talented cast and directed by a genius... after this movie i ve become the biggest fan of Christian bale.

The movie is all about the fight between 2 magicians and the quest of Angier to figure out the secret of the trick named ""the transporter man"". The movie successfully rides multiple story lines simultaneously and merges them beautifully at the end... The twist in the climax scene was breathtakingly awesome..No other suspense movie (usual suspects,6th sense, the illusionist) noting will be close enough to give a competition...

Its a 10/10 and a must watch movie for anyone who loves sensible cinema.

3 December 2010,Are You Watching closely,"This ones from my favourite director and is a a masterpiece. Great story,great writing,dialogues,throw in wonderful performance by top of the league actors,suspense,thrill and the WORLD OF MAGIC AND MAGICIANS and you have an excellent movie. went beyond my expectations.

One of those rare movie where you would love to cling onto every word uttered and every dialogue spoken which in themselves have very deep meaning(something similar to THE DARK KNIGHT).

and if will watch it you wont be disappointed. Only the question is:

ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY??

31 August 2023,Just boring,"I feel like everyone feels the need to like a Nolan's movie and even give it a 10 when it simply doesn't deserve it, the prestige starts interesting but then gives up completely on the story and characters making it boring and confusing. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but it's definitely not deserving of a 10 star rating and men should stop idolizing Nolan when there's lots of more deserving directors. The most interesting side of the movie has to be stage props and the behind the scenes of magic tricks, sadly Nolan makes it unnecessarily complicated and the movie get simply boring. The actors do a great job especially Scarlett Johansson.

23 December 2013,"Oh, that ending...","I will begin this review by stating that the ending really carried the film. If they had done the ending any different or had excluded it altogether, the film would have been entertaining, but not much else.

The movie was visually thrilling with the special effects and the acting was superb. I don't think there was anyone in the cast I truly didn't like watching. The plot twists, particularly in the last five minutes, were just...OUTSTANDING. There are few words to describe just how well this movie is and they're all alluding me.

The questions this movie brings to mind are conversational pieces long after the credits have rolled. I didn't fall asleep until a few hours after the end of the film. It was fantastic to watch and has definitely made it into my top 10.

21 August 2012,"Christopher Nolan yet again shows us a Masterpiece with ""The Prestige""","Christopher Nolan with ""The Prestige"", yet again shows his sheer brilliance and graces us with a Masterpiece. The Prestige revolves around the rivalry of two magicians; Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who's friendship turns into a bitter rivalry after Robert's wife is killed in a magic trick gone wrong and he accuses Alfred of the dirty deed.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's acting in this movie is impeccable. From the opening scene you get the feeling that both actors are literally as one with the character they are playing and this is what a top class actor must be able to do.

The plot of the ""The Prestige"" is intricate and genius; full of twists and turns that keep you in suspense and keep you pondering on what will happen next. I literally sat on the edge of my seat the whole movie. It is a well thought out and original plot that Christopher Nolan executes with mastery. Robert Angier's and Alfred Borden's whole past is shown and the whole story revolves around their rivalry in a manner deserving to be truly called a masterpiece. The rivalry between these two is depicted in a strong and vivid way and you feel as if you yourself are in the movie standing right next to the two characters. Nolan uses the idea of each of the obsessed characters reading each other's diary and this brings out a series of flashbacks mixed with the present happenings and this is what makes up the excellent chemistry of the movie.

The whole movie is a thrill to watch and the ending is profound and fitting for the whole plot; it is unexpected and one can only but give a standing ovation. I cannot begin to explain how much this movie amazed me. Nolan set out to keep the audience thinking the whole movie and he succeeded by a landslide. It is truly a movie that one cannot ignore. A story of two men's obsession with revenge and being better than the other but who can pay the ultimate sacrifice?

""Sacrifice is the price of a good trick"" --- The Prestige.",10
9 April 2007,Not as good as it could get,"The movie has all the right ingredients for a good simmering thriller. Two magicians with their bag of tricks, motive for revenge, class actors in Caine, Jackman and Bale, and above all the genius of Christopher Nolan.

However, at the end quite a few viewers may end up feeling a bit let down. Owing to Nolan's gift of offering an ingenious storyline with a twist at the ending, (Memento, Batman Begins), the expectations were always going to be very high. And indeed, the polished storytelling, the beautiful sets and the tight script all add up to a good package. But for people trying to figure out the movie, and guess the ending, most will feel a bit let down at the ease at which this is possible.

The cast is nicely rounded out. The two magicians do a very good job, and are very well supported by Michael Caine. Scarlett Johansson has little screen time, but performs well. The film is undoubtedly good, but one gets the feeling it could have been much better.",9

8 March 2007,Confused thriller about two magician's rivalry in Victorian London.,"There's only one way to say it: this is a bad movie! It uses a conventional form of interweaving the past and the present, starting with a pivotal event, the death of one magician with the other in attendance, and weaves back and forth, in and out, all the way through to the present.

Within this conventional structure we are supposed to be amazed by the magic, which is not particularly amazing, and we are almost always shown the techniques they use. Again, the magic in the film is mostly conventional.

The characters are the part of the movie that is not conventional, each one having enough neuroses and personality disorders to make them interesting, and rather humanly inconsistent, but also annoying and totally unbelievable. And I believe that all things that happen in movies have to appear credible, even the incredible events and plot twists. All of the ones in this movie seem terribly contrived.

With all the time they take for exposition (2 hours and 10 minutes!) they still have to hit you over the head with some of the plot points, and that is a sure sign of bad direction -- I won't spoil it by telling you where these are, they are so obvious that you will most likely be able to anticipate every surprise and be a bit bored as I was.

What kept me watching was the fabulous Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the beautiful sets and costumes of Victorian England.",3

18 September 2014,I always Use this Film for an Example of A Perfect Movie (Maybe Minor Spoiler),"Some reasons why:

1. The layer of the story ~ Watching the movie is like climbing up the stairs. The story goes step by step in climatic way. It's very interesting to watch and intriguing to wait what will happen next.

2. The development of the character ~ The most interesting part of the movie. This is the story about magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden that once were friends, and because of one fateful event, they became rivals and obsessed to beat and destroy each other. At first, maybe audience (in this case myself) will feel sympathy for Angeir's character, because he was the victim, and Borden was the villain that caused the death of Angier's wife. But as the story goes, and the characters develop, I don't root on him again, he showed more obsession than just revenge for his wife, his all motivation was just to beat Borden in whatever he did. And so is Borden. They both are flawed. I love how the rivalry goes darker and darker into their obsession. I change my support for the character many times, as they seem to top each other so many many times. But then i realized they're just perfectly equal. Just like Olivia said to Borden as she left him, just like the other people that just can't keep up their obsessive rivalry: ""you deserve each other""

3. The plot ~ The movie starts with ""near ending"" scene, and then goes backward from the start to the ""near ending"" point at the beginning, and reveals the final twist in the end. Before that, the audiences may have guessed so many conclusions before knowing the real twists are. Yes, there are twist after twist! I love how it surprises me so many time. Excellent!

4. The casts ~ Christian Bale vs Hugh Jackman. And they're just a perfect match on this. All the rest of the casts also brilliantly played. The visual is beautiful and this is a well made movie.

5. The tragic message and shocking end ~ At the beginning of the movie, Angier and Borden reveal the secret the Chinese magician. How he sacrifices his whole life pretending to be frail in public to hide the goldfish bowl beneath his legs just to able to perform his magic trick.

This is like a teaser to the whole story. How far one can sacrifice for his obsession, his magic, for the prestige! The point of this movie is a great sacrifice. In the end, when they both confess each other's secret, i was contemplating when the movie ended. How far one can go for their obsession. It's quite disturbing to think about what they have done to their own life. It's the movie that will make you think after watching.

Seriously, if you still haven't watched it, you have to give it a try!

PS: Don't root to one character, some people I know hate this movie because the character they root for is lost in the end. Well, just like i said they're both flawed and lost great time in the end. Be objective and you can see this is a great masterpiece and the ending is just equal and fair.",10
27 July 2020,Possibly the greatest film of the century,"No spoilers. This is probably Nolan's best movie. Do yourself a favor and watched it, if you haven't yet. If you have, watch it again. You will not regret it.

11 September 2009,A wonderful film--also see the Ilusionist,"http://mix.dailyevergreen.com/index.php?aid=29302 ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" were both phenomenal movies that received far less attention than they deserved. They made magic cool again, yet two blockbuster magic movies in one year may have canceled each other out. If you haven't seen these movies, I highly recommend renting or buying them.

Michael Caine's character in ""The Prestige"" explains that every great magic trick consists of three parts.

""The first part is called 'The Pledge.' The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called 'The Turn' – the magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary,"" his character says. ""But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough, you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige.'"" That is essentially what both movies are – great big magic tricks that will keep you guessing throughout the films. There are times during the movies where things get a bit slow, just like any magic trick, but the payoff at the end. The prestige is always worth it. As usual, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) does a near flawless directing job in ""The Prestige."" Two magicians, who begin as colleagues, become rivals after a tragedy. Their obsession with each other grows darker and more extreme as the film progresses. Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Wolverine) gives a great performance and creates the haunted charismatic Rupert Angier. Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, Batman) plays Alfred Borden the silent brooder. Acting all-star Michael Caine rounds out the trio as the experienced sage wise man caught in the middle.

On the other hand, ""The Illusionist"" focuses on a different obsession – forbidden love.

Edward Norton (Fight Club) is brilliant in his leading role as the mysterious Eizenheim the Illusionist. Despite my initial doubts, Jessica Biel (Seventh Heaven) gives a surprisingly solid performance as Norton's love interest, the Duchess Sophie. The chemistry between the two is very believable.

The conflict arises on several fronts. The Crown Prince already has plans to make Sophie his wife and grows enraged at her denial due to her feelings for the Illusionist. Paul Giamatti steals the show as Inspector Uhl, the man chosen by the Prince to shut Eisenheim down. His performance as a man torn between his duty and his own fascination of the Illusionist's many tricks is wonderful to watch.

""The Prestige"" is the better film. It had superb directing and a better plot. Yet at the same time, ""The Illusionist"" was a more enjoyable film experience. Giamatti and Norton rival Caine, and they completely outclass Bale and Jackman. ""The Prestige"" is dark, and for some, perhaps too dark. The magicians are so unlikeable at times that it is easy to stop caring about what happens to them anymore. ""The Illusionist"" has better pacing than ""The Prestige"" and doesn't veer into the absurd and unlikely.

Both movies are fantastic and either one is worth multiple viewings. They are similar but also very different. It just depends on the individual as to which one is better. However, both will make you believe in magic.",9
2 February 2008,It Was a Dark and Stormy Film,"The Prestige"" is a dark and stormy film, about two rival magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden. Angier's wife dies in a dangerous escape illusion. Borden tied the knot around her wrists, but he says he's not sure whether he tied an easy-to-escape slipknot, or much trickier one.

Angier seeks revenge, and afterward Borden seeks revenge in turn. Who gets the final revenge? Unless you are paying very careful attention, you won't know even after watching it to the end.

All the magicians are obsessed with the craft of magic, but one is slightly less crazy. And the chances are you won't be sure which is which until the end of the film.

This plot is so rich that you should see the film again to understand the nuances you missed the first time.

After you have seen the film, you can consider reading my second comment, which has spoilers intended to help you understand what's going on.

One thing: I sometimes had trouble telling Angier and Borden apart. To help you: Depending on where in the story you are, Angier has a standard middle-American or an upper-class ""King's English: accent. Borden has a lower-class English accent. Also, each of them sabotages the other's tricks at least once. After that, Borden wears gloves to cover his damaged hand, and Angier limps.",8
1 April 2022,This puzzle is a masterpiece,"From the beginning to the end, the movie doesn't fail to impress us. However you think you can predict events in any movie, here you'll fail. Unlike other films where you have to sit back, relax and start receiving data effortlessly, in the Prestige, you have to keep your mind working all the time during the movie. Needless to mention the extraordinary performance of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Cane.

I simply love it and 10 stars is less than it deserves.

29 October 2006,Abracadabra,"""The Prestige"" will dazzle you. It will show you the impossible and you'll love it. It will impress you. It will flabbergast you. You will sit in the theater after having seen it and try to figure out what you just saw. You will want to run back to the ticket-booth and buy another ticket to watch it again. You will want to watch it again, to catch it. One question will haunt you. Was it magic? ""Prestige"" is certainly movie magic, there is no doubt about that. After having waited in anticipation for many months for ""Prestige"", I was pleased to have it exceed my expectations. Starring Christian Bale (""Batman""), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine from ""X-Men""), Scarlett Johansson (The Island), Rebecca Hall, and Michael Caine (Secondhand Lions, Alfred from ""Batman""), ""Prestige"" is certainly filled with prestigious people. The cast also include Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis (Gollum), and David Bowie.

Chris Bale and Jackman play two magicians who begin as friends, but the friendship turns to obsessive rivalry when tragedy strikes. Bale is obviously the better magician, but Jackman has flair. When Bale performs ""the greatest magic trick he's ever seen"", Jackman decides to get even and the make a name for himself at the same time. Their hatred for each other puts Bale's wife and child and Scarlett Johansson in the middle of it all. The danger increases and the intensity rises as the men make attempt after attempt to outwit the other.

Chris Bale and Michael Caine had the most impressive acting, and I loved every minute they were on camera. That's not to say that Johansson and Jackman aren't great too. Surprisingly, Bowie gives a pretty good performance, not at all reminiscent of ""The Labyrinth"", which is a relief.

According to Caine's character, ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The magician of this movie is the director, and the actors who make his film come alive. When you see ""The Prestige"", you will see something shocking you've never seen before. You will look for the secret, but you won't find it. Because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. Interestingly enough, movies, just like illusions, consist of three acts. ""The Prestige"" converts a film into a magic trick. If you think you have it all figured out, think again. Because the only parts you've seen are the Pledge and the Turn. The Prestige is still to come.",10
22 September 2021,Absolute Masterpiece,"This is my favourite movie of all time. The story was very well-written and well directed. I always admire Chris Nolan's works and Christian Bale's acting skills. My eyes were glued to the screen in the whole time. Highly recommended and must watch.

29 October 2006,any one else confused?,"OK the movie was good don't get me wrong but come on now was anyone else as confused as me, i never understood it, it kept changing and the end really threw me off. it might have been better had they made it easier to understand, i mean how did the whole twin thing come up at the end? they both end up having a twin, that was weird. and you never figure out which twins live or die, its to confusing. i think they needed to explain more in the movie then it would have been a lot less confusing, i'm sure i'm not the only one who was confused, please help me out here. were you as confused as me? if anyone understood it please explain. again it wasn't a bad movie it just need to be more understandable.

22 March 2007,how far can prestige go?,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

The title itself says a lot about the movie. A lot, but for some reason it opens only after some time: for example, the meaning of the title in the concept of the entire film was revealed to me right now, when I write this. All in all, it's amazing!

19 December 2013,Another Nolan masterpiece,"Christopher Nolan has made many fantastic films. Not including the Dark Knight trilogy, he has created a reputation to keep you guessing until the very end of the movie, and often after you have left the theater. ""The Prestige"" follows the vein of Nolan's earlier works such as ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Memento"", in which the twists come fast and furious during the last third of the film. To summarize, Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play magicians who were once friends and now are out to ruin one another's career and life. Nolan creates narratives that intertwine from each magician's point of view, as both Bale and Jackman have each other's journals and are reading what they are believing to be each other's secrets. The time period is fantastic to see(late 1800's) with costumes and architecture breathing life into the film. Jackman plays an intense and determined role of Angier, while Bale often comes across as calculating and manipulative. The direction by Nolan was excellent in that he creates a story in which you genuinely like one character and loathe the other in the first half of the movie, and then your mind is changed the second half. That impressed me and kept me very interested to see the conclusion and how each character's obsession deteriorates their lives. It is a film you watch several times, as you get much more out of it after a second viewing, knowing the twists and seeing the subtle clues that Nolan cleverly waves in front of you. And of course, you don't know what hit you until the credits start rolling.",9
23 October 2006,A mess,"The movie starts out promisingly enough, dumping you in the middle of a story about an often vicious rivalry between two magicians. The setup flatters viewers' intelligence for a while, with some fancy gamesmanship and sleight of hand, literal and figurative, for them follow.

Unfortunately, it tosses away everything it had going for it. There's not enough emotional connection with either character to provoke concern about their fate--some momentary shocks, but nothing deeper. The pace slows down, so the plot becomes meandering and the viewer gets plenty of time to predict what scam is being run where. It would have taken a masterful conclusion by the time the movie ended to fully redeem the vapid tedium. There's an attempt to deliver one, but it fails miserably.

No complaints with the acting or production values. But simply not interesting.

16 October 2010,"Full of wit, intellect and gripping moments....","""There are 3 parts to a trick...."" Full of wit, intellect and gripping moments, The Prestige is a splendid watch.

Ever since I watched Memento, I've always admired the prowess of Nolan and watched most of his films(Batman series, Inception). This was a movie that was on my watch list for quite sometime now. I'm glad I watched it.

If Memento was a cerebral adventure, in this movie, Nolan tries to create an era bygone to tell a masterfully crafted narrative. Some distant reflections of Amadeus/Othello, the story adapted from a novel is original indeed. The director explores the magicians' battle for survival in a world that rewards only the best. In an attempt to overpower the other, they lose their emotions, morale and mind. The good and the evil are separated by a thin line....

Of the performances, both Hugh Grant and Christiane Bale deserve tremendous credit. Its a performance that's hard to chose between just same as that of Cage and Travolta in Face-off. Michael Caine is superb in his role once again and brings in authenticity & respect to his character. As his trademark in many movies, Nolan keeps the best for the last. Though you had enough clues, you'd never guess the climax. A simple yet riveting climax that will surely mesmerize you.

Christopher Nolan started shooting with his dad's camera at the age of 7 and made his first movie at just 27. Easily, my director of the last decade. With the kind of cinema he's making, he would soon be a legend - the likes of Scorcesse.

Looking forward to see the next Batman adventure in which I'm sure we'll see another legendary character 'The Riddler' panning out.

Prestige done. ""Following"" next; Nolan's debut movie :-)",9
30 January 2011,One of my All time Favorite Movie,"A film for not everyone A film just for true cinema lovers.

4 April 2017,The Absolute Best of Hollywood!,"In my opinion, THE best movie made by Nolan - The cast, the script and the story is just as the movie goes - Spell bounding! Just love the way the movie is setup in the early 1900's, whilst visiting some of the legends of the time (Nikola Tesla) and the element of magic only adds more flavor to the already magnificent ride through Nolan's eyes. Bale and Jackman deliver performances worth delivering.

DO NOT MISS THIS! at ANY cost!

29 May 2013,Really Wanna Watch This.,"Hey. I haven't seen this movie yet but I can't wait to see it. I really wanna see it. My friends have seen it and they really like it. I can't wait to like this movie. I really want to see The Prestige. Is there anyone on this site who wants to give me a summary or something. I am a very busy dude and so I don't know when I'll get to watch this movie. I really want to see it though. Can someone loan me this movie. Where can I find this. Do they sell this at Walmart. I have a gift card to Walmart that's why I'm asking. I really want to see this. I almost watched it last night but I didn't. It's okay though because I was just talking with Riley I don't know if anyone on this site knows her. She's a great gal. Riley has seen The Prestige. I want to watch it because Riley has watched it and so has her family. Chayse has seen it too and I bet Ana has seen it as well. I wanna see this flick.

16 August 2022,Brilliant twists,"The true story begins to reveal itself which is set in the 1900's. Borden and Angier have a long history. They are two rookie illusionists who work for the same man, Cutter. Borden had inadverdently caused the death of Angier's wife who was also his assistant. Then Borden has the audacity to tell Angier that he doesn't know which knot he tied on her, but it is not his fault really, he truly doesn't remember. Angier is a born showman who has everything that a magician should have, knack for misleading the audience easily. Borden is a more talented magician who doesn't have the showmanship, but he is improving constantly. Angier and Borden now entangle themselves into a life of dual in which neither can win, as we are shown at the starting itself. While Borden falls in love with Sarah, a sweet and beautiful young lady, Angier is sinking into a life of revenge against Borden. Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) is the beautiful assistant of both Angier and Borden. She loves both of them, but she has a much more meatier part than I am telling. I won't elaborate more on the plot than this, as it will be more amazing to see it without knowing anything about it.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play off each other perfectly and the period setting of the movie is beautiful. Except for the Batman movies, this was the first time I saw Bale in any other character and I loved his portrayal of Borden. (I skipped Terminator 4 as my friends said it was bad). Every actor performs amazingly and this was a film which I loved as the plot takes so many beautiful turns and twists, all done in a believable way (except, Tesla's machine, which won't give a shock to humans). The film also has three acts, the ending which they show at the beginning is elaborated further in the real climax. This film flows forward like a calm river which has a fall coming. It was really beautiful and poetic in many ways. The cinematography is excellent, the background score is also beautiful and the sets look very authentic. I didn't root for any one character, as both of them are flawed and no one's an upstanding man. They have their own beliefs and different methods to achieve them, but I didn't root for one, I cared for both. The ending is quite shocking and pleasing as well. If you still haven't watched this, please don't let this gem of a film pass you by. If there is a choice to see three films before I die, this will definitely be one of them.",8
9 January 2019,worth watchin several times,"This movie is a masterpiece! It is worth watching many times, as you will discover hidden clues everytime you watch it. Recommend!

27 June 2013,Review,"If you enjoy films of deception and mystery then you'll love The Prestige. The Prestige is one of Nolan's best films to date, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are a classic duo that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This film brings the magicians code to life and lets you experience how the most dedicated magicians live to perform and will do anything to be the best and better anyone who comes in their way. This film will blow you away and keep you wanting more. The film is pure gold and will not disappoint. The Batman trilogy duo Nolan and Bale have come together to provide a film that leaves you wanting more with strong characters and a war between two friends that ends with a bang. 9/10

14 September 2013,"Amazing, amazing, and again, just amazing.","This film takes a great explained ride that leaves just enough to the imagination to make you wonder, but also not leaving you wanting to rip your hair out with questions.

Firstly, excellent cast and acting, with Bale and Jackman really showing their elite status with really making these characters believable and heart felt. Secondly, the writing was great, with the tricks and the build ups being well done, not over doing it, nor under doing it.

I must say that this is my favorite magicians film, and has set the standard for which many other films of the coming years will be compared. Can't believe it took me until 2013 to watch this.

Watch it. And watch it now.

8 January 2021,Fluid and constructed well,"Tthe story follows two magicians performing in Europe circa 1900. Initially friends they will soon become bitter rivals in a tale of true obsession. As presented in the film, the story jumps around in time which is a key piece of what in the end is a masterfully constructed puzzle. Because of the skewed time line, at times we know more than the characters and at other times we know less. It makes it all the more enjoyable when all the various story lines and time lines converge and finally we, and the film's characters, finally know the whole story.

As one might imagine just by looking at the cast list The Prestige is filled with tremendous performances. As the two key magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do a wonderful job of bringing their respective characters to life. Bale is perfect as the quiet, dark and brooding Alfred Borden while Jackman is similarly spot-on as the more showy and ultimately obsessive Robert Angier. Michael Caine is reliably brilliant in his supporting role as magician's assistant Cutter, inventor of illusions. Scarlett Johansson plays a stage assistant and while her role requires her to do little more than look pretty she is certainly up to that task and makes the most of what opportunities the script provides her. Everyone else in the wide and varied cast falls into their roles well, including David Bowie whose appearance as a brilliant scientist screams out ""stunt casting!"" but who performs his part wonderfully and fits right in with the rest of this terrific ensemble. A truly great cast really brings this story to life.",9
22 October 2006,"Not to be confused with ""The Illusionist""","""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" both are end-of-the-century period pieces dealing with magicians. However, ""The Illusionist"" is a beautiful movie. Beautiful visually and beautiful inside the hearts of some of the characters. ""The Prestige"" is an ugly movie. Visually it is dark and gloomy, and the central characters are unpleasant to their core.

""The Illusionist"" is truly magical. ""The Prestige"" is more like a gangster/revenge movie at heart. Actually, heart is what it lacks.

David Bowie is wonderful, however, in his supporting role as the eccentric genius inventor Nicolai Tesla.

16 January 2021,Chris Nolan's Worst Film,"Finally saw this movie for the first time 15 years after its original release and man I have to say, what a terribly organized film. It's a shame, I really looked forward to enjoying this piece only to be left disappointed. Terrible writing and extremely poor character dialogue. Everyone seems to contradict what they say. Chris missed a lot of key developments in throughout the story. Waaaaay too many flashbacks that were completely out of sequence to the story, which in my opinion the downfall of any given piece of film. Perhaps he should have gone to film school after all. I gave it a three-star rating as opposed to one simply because it was well casted.

It was a BIG mistake. I will be hitting myself in the head for a long time to come because of this! The prestige is without a doubt a MUST WATCH for EVERYONE who loves to guess whats going to happen only to be left feeling stupid. Without a doubt (another) 10/10 movie by the great Nolan.

29 October 2006,When the Magic is Missing,"The Prestige Director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") pulls out all the stops for his latest film, the thrillingif emotionally voidThe Prestige, in which the strapping Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"") and Christian Bale (""Batman Begins"") face off against each as two magicians locked in a never-ending game of one-upmanship. Set in turn-of-the-century London, the film unfolds via flashbacks and flash-forwards that keep the audience guessing, unraveling the back story behind the murder mystery that serves as the backdrop of the plot. As the film begins, Alfred Borden (Bale) is locked a prison cell awaiting sentencing for killing someone, and that the identity of the unknown deceased comes as no great shock when it is revealed in the second act is only part of the film's troubles.

As we learn, Borden and fellow illusionist Richard Angier (Jackman, nicely shedding extended claws and rubber suits for snappy tuxedos and top hats) were once colleagues whose partnership came to an end following a tragedy caused by one of Borden's too-risky magic tricks. After parting ways, the men end up haunting each other's livesstealing each other's tricks, doing underhanded deeds, and transgressing in ways that only alpha males driven by ego and showmanship can do.

The film moves along at a brisk pace, its story punctuated by jumps back and forth in time and thrilling sequences of the men performing their awe-inspiring tricks onstage. The stakes are rather highindeed, matters of life and death are often up for grabs; yet for all the drama and heartache alluded to in the script, the film is ultimately a triumph only in style over substance. As he did in the similarly gimmicky ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia,"" Nolan places all the emphasis on events rather than characters, pulling audiences along on the adventure but never really giving us the emotional payoff the story truly deserves.

Which is a shame. Jackman and Bale both deliver commendable performances, with Scarlett Johansson luminous as always as the criminally underwritten assistant who becomes a pawn in their game of revenge. The film is also gorgeously shot and briskly directed, drawing one into the time period with such authenticity to detail yet driven by a contemporary pacing that the late 19th century feels like it could have happened just yesterday. The plot twists are often surprising as well; Nolan (working with brother Jonathan on the screenplay) is certainly a master at delivering surprises at every turn. But, ""Batman Begins"" excepted, Nolan's downfall as a director is his maddening inability to connect to his own characters. Like the feuding magicians depicted here, The Prestige merely gives the illusion of a satisfying period thriller. You may leave the theater feeling elated, but the effect wears off quickly, leaving you with the opinion that Nolan is a talented director who could afford to get himself a new bag of tricks. Grade: B.",7
1 November 2006,A terribly Disappointing Film,"The fact that this movie has received 8.6/10 is simply verification that theses ratings mean nothing. This is one of the most unnecessarily convoluted, poorly-acted film i've seen in theaters for a long time. The dialog is implausibly modern, the relationships do not take into account sex relations at the time, the the twists and turns are manufactured in a spirit of dues ex machina. Like ""The Illusionist"" before it, the twists in plot are not earned but sloppily thrown in, and even worse- boring and clichéd,save the final one, which is just stupid. The final scene is so melodramatic, long winded, and ridiculous, I considered leaving the theater- but regretfully chose to stay in hopes of some kind of redeeming quality emerging. The only one found was the long overdue appearance of credits. I'm not biased, I like Christopher Nolan's earlier works- Momento and the under looked Insomnia are both excellent- but his writing, has become very short sighted and melodramatic- Batman Begins was also poorly written, failing to cross the line into either comic book/ graphic novel fictionalized or cinematic realism. The emotional connections in this film are not developed, but like the twists lazily thrown in (particualry the relationships with women). It's the second worst film about magic this year.",4

22 December 2016,6/10,"The Prestige was decent film filled with and excellent cast, sadly the Storyline limits this movie. It is too prolonged for the plot, though it was an interesting and entertaining movie for the first 30 minuets it gets old and lacks serious substance aside from trivial feuds and shallow romance. I appreciated the realism of the dialog and admire the challenge it must have been to maintain the attention of viewers solely with the use of magic tricks but feel strongly that the length of the movie was too drawn out for the boring and anti climatic ending. Sadly it was predictable and lacked originality aside from setting and the occupation of the characters.

It has been a long time where I have seen a movie that has kept me riveted all the way to the end. The set was brilliantly made as well as the costumes. I love movies that keep you guessing and this movie will do that all the way to the end. They do a brilliant job of portraying obsession and how it destroys lives. Hugh Jackman does an excellent job yet again his portrayal of utter obsession makes the movie brilliant.I won't give away the ending but it was hard to see coming and yet it makes perfect sense. All in all it was excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a masterpiece of a movie.

21 November 2020,Genius,"The movie is not intended to be easy watch. It's meant to make your mind think and wonder Who? How? Really? Make no mistake, Christopher Nolan does not care that the movie has no hero, just two driven rivals who get caught up in a fight for power and prestige.

26 October 2006,um mm....now i need someone else to explain SPOILER,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

4 June 2018,Wonderful Movie!!,"The film ""The Prestige"" is directed by Christopher Nolan in the year 2006. The basis of the film is adapted from the screenplay from 1995 by Christopher Priest which was also based on the novel of the same name. The novel won the World Fantasy award and was famous in the world of entertainment on its unique platform. Victorian London is the place where the movie took place, by keeping it in mind that at the following time and place, and black magic were believed in by the credulous. Somerset Maugham's novel The Magician captures that period perfectly in its fictional portrait of Aleister Crawley, ""the evilest man in the world"", in which the illusion is created of the one being really an occult practitioner of dark forces. The Prestige is also plotted on the basis of illusion and magic which contains a touch of rivalry and passion. The movie has twist after twist which leads it to be successful in the film world. There are points when it will look like the movie has come to its conclusion; however, it is full of turns that keep the viewers engaged. The Duality, obsession, sacrifice, and secrecy pervading the conflict are the basic theme of the movie. The main characters are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), Alfred Borden (Christopher Bale), Oliva Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson ) and John Cutter (Micheal Caine). All of these characters have strong interpersonal relationships. ""The Prestige"" has almost about everything that is required in a movie about the world of magicians, except the prestige itself. The briefing by Michael Caine claims that every magic trick consists of three acts: (1) the pledge, an initial step in which a portrait of real situation gets set; (2) the turn, which is about challenging the initial reality; and (3) the prestige, where everything gets back to the normal and set situation again. The director tried his best to push the boundaries of their jaw-dropping parlour trick, from which the coherence of the movie's concept seems to be compromised due to the element of bunk. The film ""The Prestige"" is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned) since it has some violent scenes and a scary, menacing atmosphere; however, it is highly rated by the viewers. Overall, this movie is a serious enigma, but I highly recommend that everyone watches this movie as its very entertaining and puzzling.",9
21 October 2006,"Great movie, actors...","Well, the movie is great, actors great, everything....BUT - very clear to solve whole movie trick, beginning. They should not have shown the whole scene with the Angier's death in the tank...made me know the end and all the trick a lot earlier than I wanted. All other aspects are just great! Michael Caine is the greatest artist, Jackman is great too. I loved the performance of all the actors and the costumes, photographs were great! I will definitely watch the movie again, but with closer look! This movie is really one of the best movies, I have seen ""Batman Begins"" and this one is a lot more interesting, but just until you realise what the trick is. And as mentioned before, it is too early as for me...

22 October 2006,Go see it !,"This is an very good ""period"" film. The look of the movie (sets, costumes, etc.) are excellent and work well to set the dark, mysterious tone. Christian Bale is well cast as magician Alfred Borden and Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, & Hugh Jackman all turn in nice performances. Jackman especially seems to have fun with his portrayal of the drunkard, out of work actor ""Root"". David Bowie however, as Nikola Tesla was disappointing. Having read the book it was probably easier following the story's twists and turns better than someone who has not read it. That said, the screenplay for this film is so much different from Christopher Priest's book, I was confused by some of the movie's jumping back and forth from past to present. Although not as creepy as the book's conclusion, I found the movie's ending more satisfying.

5 November 2006,Great discussion movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. Very suspenseful, funny, and entertaining. Great acting as well and love to see Cain anytime. The movie was a little confusing as to what actually eventually happens. Most of the people I saw the movie with think that Borden had a twin brother. However I tend to think that Borden cloned himself and let the clone live. This leads to many questions. Was it Borden or the clone that was hung?....I think Borden. How come they did not suspect that Angier had bought a transporter machine?.....or did Borden's clone not know that he was a clone and that there ever was a transporter machine? Did the clones know they were going to die? You can amuse yourself for hours talking about this kind of stuff. very good movie.

30 December 2006,Very smart,"I went to see this film without big expectations. After all, there's another film with magic involved and none of them had Golden Globe Nominations. It was a big surprise to find such a clever and original film with many plot twists and amazing performances. I would recommend it to people who like to be surprised and to the ones who appreciate the world of showmen, circus, magicians, some bohemian love life, betrayals, etc ... The main roles (Slater and Jackman) are brilliant and very credible, and once again Michael Caine delivers a quality performance. Also Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful and is perfectly casted in this mysterious and romantic role.

If you haven't seen it - you've got to do everything possible, but see it.

After watching the film I've had a strange feeling left - just like I understand everything in this movie, although in fact I understood nothing... Guess, that's what The Prestige means.

Speaking with bare facts - Hugh Jackman's play is amazing. Never thought that it could be at such a high level. Bale is very, very good. Caine is astonishingly real...

Nolan's work as a director is... Unscaleable)

4 December 2021,A few hours down,"So in a fit of Daniel Craig-inspired self-loathing, I spent a few hours down the gym on Saturday. Now my normal Daniel Craig-esque physique is restored. Phew. But since my wife wanted me out the house for a while more - she works hard, she does, and I'm somewhat distracting, thanks to my aforementioned Daniel Craig-esque physique - I went to see The Prestige, a tale of two Victorian conjurors trying to kill each other.

The trouble with The Prestige is that it revolves around a single magic trick, done in three different ways. If you can guess two of them, it's not a great movie but it's still very interesting and fun; if you can't, you'll feel cheated when you hear how they're done, but it'll have been worth watching.

19 January 2022,Good,"A film about magic at different levels. The magic as art. The magic as axis of life. Art as only way to survive. Beautiful, mysterious, ambiguous and almost impeccable. In fact, brilliant job. And this status is result of delicate-precise mixture of acting, impeccable story, splendid atmosphere and the feeling than competition escapes from the screen. A seductive detail - David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a role who gives to film a special flavor. At first sigh, story of a cruel fight for success. Or a portrait of manipulation art. In fact, fresco of a time. And one of admirable roles for Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.

19 January 2022,Gloomy. Stylish. Prestigious,"The complex story of the confrontation between the two greatest magicians - the talented Alfred Borden and the spectacular Robert Angier - was woven from the slightest nuances and presented to the readers by Mr. Christopher Priest, who later entrusted the film adaptation of such a mysterious novel to his namesake - director Christopher Nolan, who previously distinguished himself with the curious film ""Remember"".

The charm of toughness, all-powerful determination and bitter irony of Alfred Borden in the masterful performance of Christian Bale entangles the viewer with invisible shackles. The charm of striving for the best results, some confusion and touching lameness of Robert Angier, played interestingly by Hugh Jackman, forces the viewer not to break away from contemplating the battle of two strong-willed and never giving up magicians, the secret of each of which is in the depths of the heart, the secret is not a well-chosen and elaborate presentation, but the secret of the soul.

This is an amazing mystical detective thriller. Often this masterpiece cannot be viewed, it needs to be reviewed only when the details are forgotten in order to feel the mystery of everything that is happening again. The cast is simply amazing. Everyone plays correctly, without trying to outshine each other. Hugh Jackman is just great, and there's nothing to say about Christian Bale, he's as good as ever. Beautiful men, beautiful women-just some kind of holiday!

You look closely but you won't see it,solely because you don't want to.

If you were to see the real trick you wouldn't want to see it another time.

Fabulous entertainment. You start with a curiosity,you sink into a mystery which would lead to another in a matter of time.

As Nolan said,do not try to understand it,feel it. Once I realized I was trying to understand it for real deal I was sunk in it,didn't know where I was or where to look at. The time sense in the movie really gives you this feeling.

But it's one of those movies that you will talk about and someone will say they never seen it like many people say this. It's crazy to me because this is one of the best movies I have seen. Please Please, if you like moments that get you tense or moments where you weren't even expecting watch this movie. A lot of people talk about Inception or Dark Knight, should be talking about this one too.

3 July 2023,"Movie Review: ""The Prestige"" (2006)","""The Prestige"" is a mesmerizing cinematic masterpiece that weaves a tale of obsession, rivalry, and sacrifice. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this gripping thriller takes us on a rollercoaster ride through the murky world of magic and illusion, leaving us spellbound until the very last frame.

The film centers around two magicians, Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman), who become entangled in a bitter rivalry fueled by their insatiable desire for greatness. Set against the backdrop of Victorian-era London, the movie immerses us in a dark and mysterious atmosphere, filled with secrets and deception.

One of the most captivating aspects of ""The Prestige"" is its exploration of the themes of sacrifice and obsession. The film delves deep into the minds of its characters, showing us the lengths they are willing to go to achieve their ambitions. As the story unfolds, we witness the toll their rivalry takes on their personal lives and the ethical boundaries they are willing to cross.

The performances in ""The Prestige"" are nothing short of extraordinary. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver nuanced and powerful portrayals of their characters, showcasing their tremendous range as actors. Their chemistry on screen is electric, and the audience is drawn into their intense and complex relationship.

Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, as he expertly navigates the intricate narrative structure of the film. The non-linear storytelling adds to the sense of mystery and suspense, keeping the audience guessing and engaged throughout. Each scene is meticulously crafted, with every shot serving a purpose in driving the plot forward.

The score, composed by David Julyan, heightens the tension and adds an eerie quality to the film. It perfectly complements the visuals and enhances the overall atmosphere of the movie. Additionally, the cinematography and production design create a rich and immersive world that feels both authentic and fantastical.

Special effects play a crucial role in ""The Prestige,"" seamlessly blending the world of magic with reality. The illusions are executed with precision, leaving us in awe and questioning what is real and what is merely smoke and mirrors. The film's editing and pace are also commendable, maintaining a relentless rhythm that keeps us on the edge of our seats.

But what truly sets ""The Prestige"" apart is the emotional impact it has on the audience. As we become invested in the characters' journeys, their sacrifices and the consequences of their choices resonate deeply within us. The film raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of obsession and the lengths we are willing to go to achieve greatness.

In conclusion, ""The Prestige"" is a haunting and profound cinematic experience. Its intricate plot, impeccable performances, and meticulous craftsmanship make it a true gem in the world of cinema. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction combined with the exceptional cast create a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. Prepare to be enthralled, captivated, and left pondering the power of sacrifice in the pursuit of art.",9

14 December 2008,Nolan at his best,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan.The climax of the film is far too awesome and well directed.I wonder if the movie is so good, then what about the novel? Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale have done an extremely terrific job.The magic sequences were very well executed and the secrets were an eye-opener. It surely is the best movie of 2006.The depiction of rivalry between the two magicians is very well portrayed and Bale's comic act is the high point of the film.In fact there are many high points, but i guess this was a cut above the rest.Also the opening and closing narration regarding ""the prestige"" is very beautifully penned and I keep repeating it in my mind.Nolan is GOD!

22 April 2009,The prestige is when conscious awaken folks minds!,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

16 July 2010,Interesting but confusing,"The film is great. I mean it has interesting plot, some action etc. BUT look at the actors. OK, they are not ""the same"" people, but with fake beards, hats and stupid cloth it is nearly impossible to understand who is on the screen now. Plus the plot is not chronological, so at the end of the movie you simply do not understand the reasons of what is going on. Who wants revenge, who does not, what does the other guy want!? This is the reason nowadays if there are 2 main characters in the movie one of the is white and the over is black. Because you do not get confused who is who!!! But com on, if you want to make two white actors make of them blond and the other brunet.

15 October 2022,You will lose the time you spend watching this folly for ever.,"This film is made for people who think they are clever by someone who thinks he is cleverer than anyone else. It's deeply cynical and heartless.

Apparently I need to write more characters to make this review go live so that is why I am writing this. Everything you need to know is the sentence above. The only reason I am writing any of his is to save the loss of precious time you'd experience by believing the hype surrounding this dead-eyed piece of film product. Cinema is an art form that can and should create universal understanding and give us a sense of what is possible and this is not cinema .

18 June 2013,Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout,"Well I've been meaning o watch this movie for awhile now but have never gotten around to it. Finally today I sat down and watched it and I was amazed, in essence this movie is beautiful. The acting by both Jackman and Bale is astonishing. Also Michael Caine preforms another fantastic role, not to my surprise of course. I also must give praise to Nolan for this adaption of the original book.

The plot was well driven and never got stale. It kept me guessing the whole time and it was full of twists and turns. After it was over I was left in an astonished.

I really recommend this movie to a sophisticated audience who doesn't mind a long, mysterious movie.

1 March 2011,Prestige of Nolan,"All right. Now this was one of the best movies I have ever watched. Christopher Nolan has never made any bad movies yet. Powerful screenplay, the end was shocking and I am still watching The Prestige over and over again to fin different ideas about what happened to Angier. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were acting really good. Bale won an Oscar with The Fighter but I think he should won another Oscar with Prestige. If the disappearing bird trick is real, too bad to those poor birds. But because of this movie, the audience aren't enjoying that trick in magic shows which is a good thing. Their ideas about Tesla Reactor was also very impressive. So let me get this straight; once again Christopher Nolan made a movie which changed my life.

30 June 2020,An unusual bad movie from Nolan,"I went into this movie expecting a lot. But when I finished the movie I felt sick, because I knew I spent 2 hours and 10 minutes of my life on this movie. Do yourself a favor, don't watch it.

21 May 2011,"OK Movie, BUT a failure as an adaptation!","When I first watched this movie, I thought it was brilliant. It's well acted, and the plot's pretty good. HOWEVER, then I found the novel by Christopher Priest in a second hand book shop. I've only recently finished reading the novel ""The Prestige"", and I have to say, the plot of the novel is so much better than the plot of the movie. After reading it, I've begun to wonder whether the Nolan's actually FINISHED reading it before they adapted it into a movie, since the plot of the movie is missing the most major plot point, which becomes obvious at the ending of the novel. To everyone who has complained about the use of Tesla's machine in the movie; READ THE BOOK, it's purpose is pivotal to the ending of the novel; a part of the plot which isn't even used in the movie!!! So, as a stand alone film, I would give Nolan's ""The Prestige"" 8/10, but Christopher Priest's novel deserves 10/10, and the fact that the movie neglects main parts of the novel for me pulls down it's rating as an adaptation by a lot...

15 May 2014,A Great Movie,"This movie is excellent! It's one of those I'm always in the mood for!!! I love that it has romance, mystery, suspense, & intrigue! I'm always a big Hugh Jackman fan but I'd have to say this is one of his best! Such great emotion in this movie... And David Bowie?!? Amazing!!! I loved him in this movie! And of course Sir Michael Cane... Exceptionally well as ever! I'm not a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson but I even thought she did pretty great in this movie! I think it's neat that Christian Bale plays in this and Batman as does Sir Michael Cane. Excellent Movie all around!!! I definitely recommend this movie... It is in my personal library!

1 November 2006,Okay Plot but Great Character Development,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The plot is perhaps a little thin, and often asks the audience to take great leaps of faith or insults their intelligence. Where The Prestige really shines is in it's ability to convey a message about the nature of obsession through its two main characters, rival magicians Borden (Bale) and Angiers (Jackman).

Will The Pretige keep you on the edge of your seat with heart pounding action and excitement? No. But if you're looking for some food for thought and a good topic of discussion among people with more sophisticated movie tastes, I highly recommend it.

25 April 2012,Amazing,"An amazing movie hands down. Slow to begin with but builds up. If your are interested in magic this is a must see. ""The Prestige"" is a little boring but you have to watch through it. Hugh Jackman is amazing and i couldn't even tell he was wolverine. Must see. Must see. Must see. Not the best movie Iv'e seen but certainly the best in a while. Yes. Its good. I cant say much else because this movie can get spoiled in so many ways. Must see. Must see. must see must see must see. Alfred from Batman is in it and he does a great job as somewhat a neutral character who you can't hate. So many twists and turns, so great. Must see. Must see. Must see.

20 October 2006,What film did this remind you of?,"For me this movie had more in common with ""The Sting"" than any film I have seen in years.

Outstanding period costumes and sets. Art direction was amazing. The Sets and costumes were so real that you just got lost in them. Just like ""The Sting"".

Convoluted and time shifting, terrific plot. You always knew what was going on but were totally surprised by the twists... Possibly even better than ""The Sting"".

I loved it... Cain should win the supporting actor Oscar for this and the people in charge of costumes, sets and writing should be rewarded as well. One of my favorite films of 2006 without a doubt.

It has been a couple of years since I have enjoyed a film this much. A great film about Magic and showmanship, about obsession and about illusion. Bravo!",10
24 February 2020,Absolutely great movie.,"Loved it. Totally. One of the best movies I've ever watched.

21 October 2006,Even better than the book!,"Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He has taken a tale that has already received international acclaim and boldly changed it into something even more spectacular. For once I was not disappointed that I had read the book before seeing the movie. Although the book is also great, this film makes a few minor changes to the story that have a major impact on how this movie works. The pace is changed up quite nicely and doesn't follow the same linear format of the book. There are also some new tricks introduced that are very pleasing to the eye as well as the mind. Most importantly, the movie does a great job starting the rivalry off with clear reasoning, which the book, although stated very plainly, was still a little bit ambiguous and confusing. The roles are brilliantly cast and Christian Bale in particular does a stand-out job as the cold, calculating, and very one-dimensional Borden. Much like a good magic trick, this movie will astound you with it's secrets and will have you thinking about it long after the credits start rolling. Even as someone who had read the book and thought he knew all the secrets - I must admit I was mystified and just as caught up in it as everyone around me. The Prestige is true movie magic!",9
22 November 2013,Was a great film for enjoyability and the story line and its production,"Was an excellent film.

One of Christian Bale's and Hugh Jackman's best performances as rivals. The production of the film is excellent as is the storyline. A film that is fun to watch sitting on the sofa with a big bowl of popcorn.

A great family film or film to watch with friends. Will keep you entertained and you'll be able to watch it over and over again and it wont get boring.

Bale's second best performance after Batman. Jackman's joint best performance going hand in Hand with Wolverine.

A film full of Eye candy for the girls. Also for the boys there is action so a bit of both.

11 February 2013,Censorship of Home Video?,"I rented a copy of the Prestige and when the scene came up with Alfred Borden's complex illusion, the full take was cut. Alfred Borden bounced the rubber ball, went in one door, and then the take was cut before he came out of the other door and cached the ball. I really remember being blown away the first time I saw this scene in the movie and I am 100% sure the full scene was edited out of this rented copy. Why would they edit this scene out of the movie? It was breath taking, but would it really be considered a disturbing image? I really think there is a special place in hell for censorship. If this artful scene was simply to provocative for some small minded Christian, then people need to be aware they are not getting the full advertised value of their purchase. I really feel bait and switched, ripped off, and offended by this beautiful movie being edited for reasons I find difficult to fathom. This movie ""titled"" THE PRESTIGE, 2006 was rented from Family Video, and was distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment Inc. Burbank California

If I find that this movie was edited at the request of Family Video I will cancel my membership with that establishment. If this censorship is the work of Buena Vista Home Entertainment I would demand that Family Video no longer stock titles from this distributor. If the efforts of Buena Vista Home Distribution are to censor films then I consider this company to be criminally destroying cultural history and your actions are akin to an Orwellian ""ministry of truth"".

I personally feel like part of my history has been taken away from me. I have heard rumors of censorship in the home movie industry but until now I was not aware of it affecting the art I love.",

15 November 2006,Do you really care about the clones!!!,"I really don't care much about the clones, the movies is great, the way they go back and to the future and present is good, it doesn't let you lose interest , and besides the ending is even greater, perhaps I have the same doubts, how come the clone always ends up on the tank? and why on his first try when he reached for the gun the clone tried to talk and say something, who know's and the one that got the bullet was the original Hugh and not the clone!!! shouldn't it be the same person? during the last hour of the film I was starting to hate ""Freddy"", he was bad and inhuman as Olivia called him, but with the twins everything made sense, and I feel in love with the character all over again! Every one tried to patched up their mistakes, one brother asked the other for forgiveness for Sarah's suicide and was worried hell for Jess's well being! And Cutter tried to make it up for hiding since the beginning the fact that there were two brothers, 'cause he knew, he made them disappear and reappear, as all magicians should! I hate magic

27 August 2013,Must See !,"Great twist after twist after twist! Maybe the final twist had something to be desired and could have taken the movie all the way to the upper echelons but like I say, MUST SEE ! The actors are all fantastic and maybe Bales' best role ever. No matter where Micheal Caine plays, it is always an added success to the movie. One sees that evidently from the movie Inception (also by Nolan). Script fantastic with all the twists and like I said above (not mentioning details so that no spoilers involved) the final twist could have had the element to take the movie rating to 10 and reach the upper echelons. The director has taken the movies to new levels giving the era of the screen play but could be very contemporary.

Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Did such a great job they look like completely different characters.

Plus I loved the directing style of Christopher Nolan and the cinematography of Wally Pfister

I highly recommend this movie.

20 September 2013,One of the best films that I've seen in awhile...,"This is my favorite film of all time right behind Schindler's List. This is my favorite film of Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (besides Les Mis). The acting is Perfection. And the concept is mind blowing. I had to watch the ending several times to fully understand it. But I like movies that make me think. If you don't like movies like that or you don't like mind twisting films then you may not like this film. But this movie is perfection. If I could give it a 9.8 I would. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys films like me. If you love a plot twisting, perfect film.. This one is for you. So I hope that my review helped you and that you take this movie into consideration because personally I thin it's worth it.

29 September 2013,Thought provoking and entertaining. A must see!,"The Prestige provokes thought the whole way through. It kept me guessing and every time I thought I knew what was going to happen there was another twist. It kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. It had multiple subplots that intertwined and layered perfectly together to deepen and advance the main plot.

The film was a great representation of the time it was portraying. The relationships between the two magicians and the assistant were intense and very believable. I enjoyed the grand illusions and how a behind the scenes look at them was presented to the audience.

So, you start off with a story that is exciting, thought provoking, new and exciting. Then you add a director with the caliber of Christopher Nolan and you know you have something that is purely amazing. Finally you cast actors with the talent and on screen chemistry of Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine and the final product? PURE GENIUS.

Although I was enticed by Jackman and Caine's performances Bale is the one who really stole the spotlight for me. I have enjoyed every film that I have seen which Christopher Nolan has been apart of.

It is a film like Inception and Donnie Darko in the sense that to truly understand and appreciate all of the elements in the film it needs to be seen more than once. The Prestige also exhibits similarities to these films in that they have a dark undertone and wildly interesting and captivating plots.

I recommend this film to all of my friends. It definitely makes the cut for my all time top 10 favorite films.",10
5 December 2006,Excellent plot- - but too predictable,"I went to see this movie the other day... I had seen many trailers and I've been expecting it for a long time. This is what I think about it: it has an excellent plot and pretty good performances (well...Scarlett is a piece of wood and Hugh-- I believe he didn't notice it wasn't X-men's set... but the rest of the actors are good). It has many ridiculous things (like the fact that ""Robert Angier"" kept all the bodies of the men he'd killed) but the special effects are amazing! Everything is SO predictable, that all the explanations at the end of the movie shouldn't be there... Finally, I think it could have been THE movie of the year.

8 December 2013,The Prestige: Are you watching closely?,"The Prestige is Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Christopher Priest's book by the same name. Some of the most memorable aspects of this film are the interactions and dialog between its characters. There's a scene where Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) tells his wife Sarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) that he loves her. She asks him to repeat it and he does, ""Not today"" she says. Confused, Alfred asks her what she means. Sarah: ""Well some days it's not true. Maybe today you're more in love with magic. I like being able to tell the difference, it makes the days it is true mean something."" Nolan is trying to show how Alfred's obsession with his hobbies is interfering with all other aspects of his life. But there's more beneath the surface. These interactions allow us to understand the movie's characters on a deeper level, a peek behind the curtain of their lives if you will. The actors picked to play these characters were nothing short of excellent; Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie... Hugh Jackman brings an unanticipated passion to his character Robert Angier. I'll admit when I thought ""magicians"" Jackman was not the first name to pop into my head. However I was pleasantly surprised with his spectacular performance. He really shows his versatility as an actor when you see him play his drunken barfly and prospective double, Root. Speaking of versatility Christian Bale has always been an intense method actor. It really shines through in his cold and devious take on Alfred Borden, so much so his character is even fearful and menacing at times. Bale truly makes you believe his character is willing to go to great lengths to become the world's greatest magician. Under the direction of Christopher Nolan, The Prestige is clever, daring, and ultimately surprising. He continues to prove himself as an established director in the industry with his brilliant take on the source material. He's created a unique film with a wide vision for this time period. With an all-star cast and a keen eye for detail, Nolan provokes audiences to see past the surface to the deeper meaning behind the illusions. Symbolism is a huge facet of multiple scenes which begs the question, ""Are you watching closely?"" I particularly enjoyed the element of suspense he was able to inject into this type of film. After all, what good magic trick doesn't keep you guessing? The fact that I couldn't immediately tell the fate of most of the characters involved was extremely refreshing. That element of suspense created another feeling of fear for the wellbeing of each character. I often found myself wondering, ""Who would best the other and how would it happen? Are these men willing to kill one another just to prove a point?"" The Prestige is dramatic story of rivalry, betrayal, and sacrifice. This is a world where people want to believe in magic, they want to be fooled to think that there is something greater outside their average and ordinary lives. The magicians know the secret and the audience might think they know, but as Borden says, ""The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything."" The quest to hold that bewilderment over the audience is a central theme these magicians seek to control. The road to this type of power is wrought with greed, bitter loneliness, and even death. Another theme here was that of a broken heart. Tragic though it may be, some hearts just never mend. How far would you go to peruse your passion? How far is too far? This movie is about becoming so consumed in a lust for vengeance and fame that nothing else matters. At our very core we are human and humans make mistakes. I'd like to quote Alexander Pope by saying, ""To err is human; to forgive, divine."" If The Prestige is meant to teach us anything it's that we often lose sight of what's most important in life, that we can even lose sight of ourselves. The secret here is nothing is more important than the lives of your family and loved ones. We should also be content with what we have; obsession poisons the hearts of men. Nothing is worth destroying the existence of others to benefit ourselves. In this case, the end will never justify the means. So again I ask you, how far are you willing to go? Would you take a life? Would you save one? This is a film that will surely resonate with its audience for some time, as it has with me.",8
31 January 2017,Wonderful,"This is absolutely one of the best movies ever seen.

I don't know why it's still so ""unkown"", compared to many other movies of the same level, or less.

Here you can find the right mix of suspense, surprise and a marvelous plot with a touch of Sci-Fi, that doesn't impact the reality of the scenario. Wonderful the final, one of those you keep in memory for a long time. Impossible to forget!

Adding two actors like Hugh Jackman and Christopher Nolan (both of them in one of their best interpretations), it's difficult not to give the maximum vote: 10!

30 December 2013,Make sure you are watching closely!!,"Arguably the best movie directed by Nolan. Every time I watch it, feel like I have discovered a new secret in this movie. Sometimes I feel one can do doctorate on this movie. A movie made from a good book always makes sense. Though I have not read the book still I feel it is one of the best movies based on a book. Its a complete Psycho-mystery, as it progresses form two different psyches. This movie allows you to be the judge between the good and the evil, and yet it leaves many doubts in your mind.Dare you allow your mind to wander on something else while watching The Prestige,you will miss many things. This movie can be presented in hundred ways and the way it has been presented and edited, leaves you full of surprises and doubts.It will confuse you but will entertain you and will give you optimum utilization of your time.I am sure I have not given you any valid reason to watch this movie, but if you like watching movies, you must have already watched it or you don't really like watching movies.

28 March 2014,One of My Favorites,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.

It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.

Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.

10 April 2014,impracticable magic,"I watched The Prestige in class. The first time I watched it, it was really hard to understand, because the action jumped from the past then to the present too many times, so that made me confused. However, that jumping from past to present turned out to be a big adventure in this movie. The changes in time happened because the story frequently followed the events written about in a diary which was written by a magician. One of the main characters was a man named Borden, who had his hand injured during a dangerous magic act. He had a twin brother, but the two of them pretended to be only one person. Because of this, the second twin had to cut off two of his fingers in order to look exactly like his brother. Also, one of the twins always had to pretend to be someone else. They did this to fool people in their magic act. I asked myself lots of questions while watching The Prestige. If I were in the movie, I do not know if I could give up my fingers to be popular. A Chinese magician in the movie also lived a lie for by pretending to be old and weak just to make his magic work. He did impracticable magic that people were amazed by. I could never do that. I think this movie does not focus only on magic tricks. It shows us how humans are unreliable, greedy, delouse and full of tragic madness, all to create amazing magic.",9

7 July 2014,A true masterpiece,"A psychologically thriller plot, a subtle sci-fi background, a twisted romantic story that doesn't eclipse the main one and a jaw-dropping ending are the recipe of this true masterpiece. I think that while Memento is the expression of Nolan talent behind a camera,this is Nolan best screenplay and book adaptation. Nolan brothers have done something astonishing in terms of plot: they did the best work that can be done! Everything is in the right place, at the right time, confusing and hypnotizing you until you are completely caught in a spiral of violence and love, reason and magic. These two sides of a magician show are wonderfully interpreted by an amazing Bale and a surprisingly good Jackman! I recommend this film to all the people who love to be tricked, charmed and amazed by a movie, because this is The Prestige: only something that seems so normal and trivial that can surprise you like no other can.

14 August 2016,A masterpiece from Nolan,"This movie isn't the only unique narrative that has come from Nolan. Among the most known are obviously Interstellar and Inception. However, in my opinion 'The Prestige' takes the cake. It tells the story of two stage magicians driven by rivalry, hopes of fame, money and happiness.

The movie starts off by explaining the three elements of a magic trick. 'The Pledge', or the ordinary, 'The Turn', or the extraordinary done by the ordinary, and 'The Prestige', the essence of the extraordinary (also called the reveal). The movie itself is implicitly split into the three parts, with Nolan building up to the movie's own Prestige. In the Pledge, the movie introduces our primary characters - magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in London. The movie explores how the two magicians who start off as friends slowly end up at each other's throats due to a magic act taking the life of Angiers' wife, and the water escape artist Julia.

The whole script is written in a series of flashbacks, and narrations from a diary which consistently misdirect the audience's concentration like an attractive assistant in a magic trick. The whole movie focuses on proving to the audience how we, as the spectators, like to be fooled by the trick, rather than figure out the trick itself. Nolan puts all clues in front of our eyes, starting with the hats, Borden's weird behavior, Borden's ingeniør's character, his continuously switching love interest and yet, the reveal is unpredictable and comes as a shock when it finally happens.

Angier is the typical showman. He knows how to charm his audience, but lacks the technical prowess. Borden on the other hand, understands the nature of stage magic, but fails to understand how to sell his show using proper showmanship. It all starts when Borden's urge to try a new knot in the water escape trick causes the death of Angier's wife on stage. This causes a long series of hatred, jealousy and cheap tricks(sabotage, accusations and killings) between the two magicians now working alone.

For a movie on magic to have the desired effect, the ambiance created within the movie needs to be very powerful. This has been done exceedingly well in the movie as well. All the stage costumes, the background music, their disguises, everything creates a spell of immersion for the audience to enjoy.

In my opinion, The Prestige is a must watch movie for anybody who wishes to give his/her mind a jog.",9

24 February 2015,Dark magical thriller,"This movie enthralled me in every shot. The actors showcased finesse in terms of acting and Chris Nolan achieves a tour de force in every shot. For a lover of period dramas, I found the movie incredibly well-directed and the suspense trickled drop by drop as the scenes progress. I have not read the book but apparently the author wanted Nolan to adapt his story. I would say he had an excellent hunch. Rebecca Hall especially made a mark. The last time I saw her in Parade's End (the BBC TV mini series), she took my breath away. Hugh Jackman lives under the skin of his character. Christian Bale succeeded in pulling the wool over the audience's eyes too. All in all, a classy movie.

In the point of own subject,deserved better than 7 rating man. Bcse of wondering whats gonna happen during the film,its not boring. I specially enjoy watching films which unknowable until it goes end. Using Tesla and some theories made film' atmosphere interesting and you feel yourself living in those times. As result of my own experience this film,I recommend it to every sci-fi lovers.

14 October 2015,"Justifies the genre. Mystery, Thriller, Drama!!!","The title never gives an idea about the movie (unless you are a magician or magic fan). The star-cast DOES INCLUDE a lot of STARS. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and so on.. Movie depicts two competitions. The most part is the competition of two stage magicians trying to defeat each other. On the other hand, the competition between two iconic scientists (Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla) is shown as well (not much of it though). I wont tell much about the story but one thing is for sure, when you are going to watch this movie (for the 1st time of course) then do keep your heart-rate under control (Mandatory stuff). Christopher Nolan showed his class. Entire crew did great and the movie turns out to justify it's category of being MYSTERY, THRILLER, DRAMA! (Also Twister from my side). 10/10 movie.. Cant say whether it's a one time watch or more but surely this movie deserves a lot of appreciation (that it got)..

2 June 2015,One of the best movies ever,"""The Prestige"" is a thrilling and entertaining movie until the last second. It is full of unexpected turns and sudden twist, which lead the spectators to stay in their seats. I liked to watch this movie a lot, because most of it was very realistic. I just did not like the part with ""the transported man"" and this whole science stuff. For me the movie gets better the more you think about it afterwards. You recognize a lot, when you watch the movie again, but I won't spoiler now, because you are maybe going to watch it. In my eyes it makes up the beauty of the film, that there is no villain or ""good guy"" the audience wants to survive. To conclude, the actors were brilliant, the story was great and absolutely everybody loved the film.

4 June 2015,Underrated and Should Not Be Missed!,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is one of those movies that I think has gotten overlooked, and may have been looked at negatively because of it. I think that this is one of the best movies that I have seen for several reasons, and I think that everyone should give it a try. I will focus on two things about the movie: what makes the plot so compelling and the casting of the movie.

The Prestige is about two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who become rivals to one another. They begin working together as friends, but a terrible event tears them apart for the rest of their lives. The story consists of exciting plot twists, revenge, sabotage, and an end reveal that will keep you thinking about it for a while after it's over. The story really excels at spending its duration leading up to the climax while keeping you interested and thinking. In a world where Hollywood is dominated by action blockbusters, this movie stands out by asking you to think. In a way, the movie kind of gives you an active role because you will be trying to figure out what will happen throughout the film. This movie has added value in that it should be watched more than once for you to fully understand the ending. There are many times throughout the movie that Nolan hints at the ending that you will think nothing of until you know how the movie ends and watch it again.

Christopher Nolan also did a good job in the casting for this movie. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were perfect for the two main roles. They really gave you the sense that they were once friends, but now only had the goal of destroying the other's life and work. They were surrounded by many other good actors and actresses like Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, and Andy Serkis who all provide great performances. Overall the casting choices really fit well together, and they made the movie flow very well. Everyone felt very well fit for the roles that they were given.

So to finish off, I think that this movie is underrated because maybe it is hard to understand or it is not an action blockbuster, but I think that it provides lots of entertainment and worthwhile content. The benefits of re-watching it is another reason that I think that everyone should check this one out. Anyone who like movies that make you think even after they are over, and provide an incentive to watch them again will not be disappointed with the prestige.",10
6 November 2006,*Spoiler* about Angier,"Here's what I think. I don't know if it's already been stated, but I'm sending it anyway.

The first time Angier ""transported"" himself he did transport himself, leaving the clone behind. That's what I gather from the scene, because it seems that the clone picked up the gun as Angier was trying to explain that he was the real one, but was shot before he could finish. So from then on out the clones died. That explains the reason why at the end when Borden is down there Angier is so shocked from drowning. Yes, it could all be part of the frame up, or he could just be freaking out because he was in fact drowning. And that's got to suck. But you'd think after the first time of going through that, if it was him who was dying every night and not the clone, he'd figure out a different way. So go ahead. Tear me apart.

10 August 2015,Amazing twists and great thriller!,"It was magic! An amazing Christopher Nolan thriller and a great drama. 130 minutes may seem long, but I did not even realize that I spent more than 2 hours when the film ended.

The atmosphere was breathtaking, the costumes were original and represented the late 19th century quite well.

Christopher Nolan used successful flashbacks; in every flashback you complete the pieces of the puzzle and your curiosity increases until you see the final scene.

One last word for the performance of Hugh Jackman, it was spectacular, you really see that he feels his role deep inside his soul.

Do not miss the magic, are you watching closely?",9

5 November 2006,Possibly the best picture of the 21st century,"I'm going to keep this short and to the point, I've got to admit, this, for me as an experienced film composer, is probably the best written and most entertaining film of the 21st century thus far. On a whole new level in comparison to some of the other pictures and screenings with similar settings. It literally kept me in my seat glued to the screen in attempt to understand and comprehend the plot at hand. The acting was superb, really impressed with Jackman's and Bale's performance! Great actors as far as i'm concerned. Caine and Johansson added great flavor and were completely appropriate. I recommend this video 100%, whether it be at home with the family and friends, or by yourself at theater or with your loved one (Kelly), there just isn't a setting in which this movie isn't superb. Not surprised if it is listed as an academy nominee, should be rated higher on IMDb.

22 October 2006,"Magic ""tricks""","I found it jarring that the movie kept using the term ""trick,"" as in ""The greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" If you see the trick, it's not good magic. This is particularly annoying since the introduction (included in the previews) purports to give you a lesson in magicians' terminology, (the Pledge, the Turn, the Prestige) and then goes on to use grade-school argot. A magic trick is something you buy at Jack's Joke Shop. Magicians don't ""do tricks"", they perform, and the performance involves a series of effects or illusions, not a bunch of tricks. An effect may involve one or more tricks (slights, gimmicks, etc.) and it's proper to refer to them as such, but to confuse the effect and the trick is a vulgar error. You don't display tricks, but there may be a trick to what you do. The effect isn't a secret, since that's what people see. The trick IS a secret. Professionals at the turn of the century were pretty huffy about this.

25 October 2006,"A slow, obscure story done very well","After all the critical brouhaha, I found this film a snore. Ponderous. Glad I saw a screening and didn't have to pay for it.

I started out wanting to like this film. It's visually beautiful - great art direction and visual effects, but the pace is much too stately and the major plot lines are too purposely obscure. There is a sense of obsession and an undercurrent of evil, but it's so well hidden you aren't scared, or very interested.

While Bale, Caine, Jackman, Johansson, et al gave credible performances, we don't care about the characters enough to attempt to wind the confusing threads of plot into a story we care about. I found the ending ""Yeah, and?...""

Compare and contrast this with 1967's ""Eye of The Devil"" with David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Sharon Tate, et al. While some think this film somewhat slow and muddled, the viewer cares about Catherine's fear and suspicion of the ominous conspiracy surrounding her, her husband, and children, yet she never stops loving Phillipe. You sense Phillipe's love for her and because of this, his ambivalence about accepting his approaching fate, which Catherine discovers, to her horror. And despite her best efforts to protect the children after Phillipe is sacrificed, we see at the end that their young son secretly accepts his gruesome legacy.

Wish it had been better.

22 October 2006,No Hocus Pocus here,"Following the plot is a little confusing at first, but once you get into the swing of the flashbacks, it's a fascinating movie. And the casting, my god, it's genius: Two of the hottest, most talented male actors under 40 - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman; the latest It Girl - Scarlett Johanson; an established character actor - Michael Caine; and a rock legend - David Bowie. An article in Premiere Magazine says that both Bale and Nolan agreed that right after the first viewing, they wanted to watch it again. I can see why: there are so many layers to this movie that it will take a few watchings to understand and truly appreciate what's happening. Don't know if any of the performances are Oscar-worthy, but it's definitely a film to watch this fall.
