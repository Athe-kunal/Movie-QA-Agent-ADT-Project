4 October 2013,"Great Visuals, Weak Script overall",Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,7
19 October 2013,"A stellar space film that is literally about space and vertigo and survival--fiction, but not science fiction",Gravity 2013 A ridiculously visual movie The photography is astonishing Astonishing Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie The idea of being under constant stress worrying for your main characters should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron s previous major film Children without Men And like that film he works with his same cameraman Emmanuel Lubezki who has become a co conspirator in his films That s a good thing This movie is a visual stunner Yes it has a lot of effects if you can call them that but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable even as they tip into the fabulous It s an achievement Sandra Bullock is the main character here even more than her co lead George Clooney And she s pretty amazing You might think she doesn t get much room to stretch her abilities trapped in space the whole time but this is exactly where it shows how good she is Even when she s talking to herself she makes it real and moving not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment Clooney is also strong playing the more experienced astronaut to a T including his enduring calm in crisis Once you are done watching and leave the theater or stand up from your couch you might actually feel disoriented Certainly in 3 D and I saw it in the IMAX version the effects are visceral But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about Or rather if it was about anything more than the one relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near death mishaps The answer is no And that s a strength It s definitely good that the writers including the director did not push the sentimentality too hard there s a little And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self No this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth haha as the vivid Grey No distractions here Except the visuals Even in 2 D this must be something to marvel at The 3 D was really really good and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft but it s also really subtle There are few moments memorable ones like Bullock s tears where the dimensional aspects come forward But the film basically uses the 3 D effects to enhance what is already there nothing more This of course enhances a lot but in respect to the story The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work including the almost laugh out loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes with fluidity and without breaks no edits no cuts is both beautiful and effective There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it let alone then do and succeed The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock s The camera continues its approach getting in on her helmet with reflections and her face and then finally her eye yes that close and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head looking out at the spinning universe listening to her panic Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this step by fluid step It takes a really long time it happens without a single break which means you are given no emotional escape and it s both gorgeous and taut with terror There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away but you have to just let all that go It doesn t really matter It s not about likelihood on any level And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable It s hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another No it isn t crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film and it doesn t work its way into social or psychological significance but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless a postscript be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film Aningaaq which is recently posted all over Google it,8

23 July 2023,Planet Earth is Blue & There's Little You Can Do...,You ve been floating round the Earth outside the bubble making repairs to telescope whose name is Hubble and then proverbial hits the fan deviating from the plan before you know it you re cast adrift in lots of trouble Matt Kowalski reaches out to gather in you make your way with him to station that s within but it s battered and quite bruised you re frustrated and bemused and the air you breathe is getting rather thin But the cards that you ve been dealt may just play out although there s not insignificant amounts of doubt in fact the chances are quite low that you will find a place to go though a trajectory has been set somewhere about,8
27 July 2014,The Most Visually Stunning Film Of 2013,Truly epic in scale Whilst Gravity falls short against films like 2001 A Space Odyssey it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso Cuar n Cuar n is one of my all time favourite directors and this CGI heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director DOP and VFX artist The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats this is true in every aspect the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Just shy from winning Best Picture over 12 Years a Slave Gravity left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name and it deserved each and every one of them A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect,

13 October 2013,Stars in Space,Visually stunning A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent None of the great themes of Kubrick s 1968 masterpiece 2001 A Space Odyssey are present here This is a superlative 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to story wise It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn t accomplish because what it means to accomplish it does in spectacular fashion I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Why If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before great unknown actors would have added an extra something Kubrick used Keir Dullea in 2001 A Space Odyssey yes Keir Dullea or as Noel Coward put it Keir Dullea gone tomorrow We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she one way or another will land safely She s terrific don t get me wrong but I wasn t as worried about her as I should have been The last problem was the score Why A standard horror action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department Now putting all that aside director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D,8
14 September 2013,In Space No One Can Hear You Scream,Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER In space no one can hear you scream Alien s In space no one can hear you scream tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all time That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuar n s latest thriller Gravity Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock Gravity puts the two A listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr Ryan Stone Bullock to float untethered in space Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky Clooney who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90 minutes Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible Alfonso Cuar n is chiselling himself quite a career He was last behind the camera for Children of Men 2006 which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 2004 But Gravity is his best work to date Bullock carries the film expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination and Gravity centers on the two main characters only There are no other developed characters Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn t amount to 2 minutes if strung in order With only two actors to carry the entire 90 minute runtime the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background And the visuals are fantastic There are no side stories sub plots unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left Gravity is the best 3D film ever Ever Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound both loud and quiet and you have a faultless mix Gravity will contend for Oscar s in Visual Effects Sound and Editing Cuar n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character s success in each new attempt at survival With still a few months left in the year it s too early to call a film the year s best But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year s conclusion It s that breathtaking It s that good www killerreviews com,9

21 September 2018,"Gravity isn't just a movie, it's an experience",Gravity isn t just a movie it s an experience It s an experience of sight it s an experience of sound and it s an emotional experience as well This film makes you feel like you are drifting among the stars instead of just showing you a story set in space The visual effects are unique awe inspiring and terrifying and while the plot is simple there is beauty in its simplicity I ve never seen a movie quite like Gravity,9

15 June 2014,"If this had been a silent film, it would have been perfect",Visuals 10 Script 0 If this had been a silent film it would have been perfect but sadly it s rife with banal and irritating chitter chatter none of which was used to truly propel the story nor profoundly flesh out the characters Everything that needed to be known could have simply been shown in a couple of captions and expressed through body language facial expressions NOTHING needed to be said here especially not this dribble that was passed off as dialogue The special effects and astounding real ness of this film however blew me away The attention to detail and the shocking realism of the actors weightlessness is stunning Though I warn you anyone who is highly sensitive to motion sickness will want to avoid this film Clooney s performance may be generic due to his weak water scripting but Bullock s performance is impressive and uncharacteristically physical There is a faint hint of 2001 Space Oddessy in the scent of this film though it clearly stands apart The not so subtle metaphors for gestation birth re birth and evolution are beautifully illustrated in this film and give the viewer an eloquent buffet of food for thought The ecological situation this film presents is quite serious and not something that one might have been previously aware of kudos to director and writer Cuar n for approaching this little known yet globally effecting subject which not only effects the environment but also the future of human space exploration and communications I recommend that you check out the accompanying documentary which is offered as a special feature on the DVD Because the dialogue is so painfully stupid next time I watch Gravity I ll be sure to put the film on mute and enjoy its visual excellence with some ambient music instead voila perfection,5
8 June 2017,"A visual technical and directorial achievement, but there is much more to 'Gravity' than those things",To me Gravity may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film s merits However while it is easy to see why some won t like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1 10 rating with the visuals effects and direction being such an achievement the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director all his films to date have proved that Children of Men is especially good and one of the best films of the decade have always have had a huge soft spot for A Little Princess Y Tu Mama Tambien is not for everyone but for me it was a near masterpiece Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the best directed films of the Harry Potter franchise and as polarising as Gravity is there is no denying that Cuaron s direction and the visuals were exceptional Gravity may be my second least favourite film of his with Prisoner of Azaban still very good faring least this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron s talent Gravity does fall short of perfection Its weak spot is the script it does tend to ramble feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn t do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clich s The story doesn t always grip with a few slow dull spots and the ending puzzles However as said already in this review and by previous reviews acknowledged in most less than positive postings Gravity is a triumph visually and technically The cinematography is tremendous quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013 The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel Cuaron s direction is exceptional some of the best he has ever done a master of visuals and mood With that being said Gravity has much more to it than the visuals and direction The music is an incredible fit it s haunting sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful A good deal of the story is gripping with intimacy tension and great emotional impact Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly Ed Harris is also impressive Overall an achievement visually technically and directorially but despite its faults Gravity is much more than those things 8 10 Bethany Cox,8

21 February 2014,"GRAVITY (Alfonso Cuaron, 2013) **1/2",I really cannot understand the gushing reviews this has been getting and the accolades being constantly bestowed upon it there is really nothing outstanding or even new about it period Much has been said about its excellent visual effects but the same is true of countless other sci fi efforts so no big deal there Similarly it was acclaimed as a tension filled two parter set against a forbidding backdrop well this type of film has been done and much more engagingly if you ask me for years take John Boorman s HELL IN THE PACIFIC 1968 for one As space operas go then its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY both 1968 and ALIEN 1979 only serve to expose its essential dramatic and artistic shallowness enough said And frankly the decision to cast stars annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney yeah right I totally buy them as astronauts which goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself Thankfully the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film s running time so we do not get any tear jerking flashbacks to Bullock s tragic past on Earth even so her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clich d as they come Anyway the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so panic attacks contact with Base is invariably lost early on incidentally Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 1995 floating all too easily between various space stations most of them conveniently unworkable being peopled by corpses boasting non English friendly equipment oddly self combustible or simply meteorite targets As for its visually arresting silent sequences of the extensive shuttle damage again this is no novelty Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT and in any case it eventually wears thin with the repetition And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney bailing her out when all hope seemed lost by the way his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her while he is himself headed for certain death come off as comical more than anything else One might argue that I have said very little in the movie s favour to justify even its average rating this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance,5

22 November 2021,Fantastic,I really love this movie I read many reviews here questioning that several things in the movie are implausible hurt science etc etc I would just like to know which sci fi movie is totally believable kkkk none The name itself says it is a fiction if it were reality it would be a documentary Matrix 2001 Interstellar Prometheus Blade Runner Alien The Terminator Star Wars Dune Arrival Contact etc They are all implausible and hurt science And All wonderful So this argument from implausibility is the stupidest I know Didn t like the movie Okay but don t use this argument it s a fiction not a documentary Finally I would like to say that this was one of the few movies in my life that I enjoyed with Sandra Bullock I really think her filmography is terrible as I remember only this Gravity and The Lake House are saved And the funny thing is that besides thinking she s very beautiful I think she s an excellent actress therefore a waste of talent in so many bad movies By the way excellent soundtrack 10 10 rating,10
5 October 2013,Gravity for your eyelids,Open Water in Space i guess A lame story which fits on a coaster stretched to the excess before people would get bored to death All solely carried by visual effects The problem here to convey the infinity wideness of space to the audience you need a reference point otherwise all you could show is a black background with little light dots on Obviously you have to show the only reference point available over and over again the Earth from 400 km above and what you see is more or less the same for 90 min And honestly Sandra Bullock in a space suit doesn t give me the slightest impression of what it would mean to be in such a situation as an astronaut Either you see a white space suit in front of the Earth spinning around or you see a face from inside the helmet of a space suit The drama plot could be easily translated to someone being captured in a small room anywhere that the whole thing happens in Space does not make any difference plot wise The possible ways to get rescued are crystal clear either someone picks you up or you die And if this wouldn t be boring enough for the viewer there s only one possible way to die no sharks or whatever and you can t die from being attracted by gravity So even the title of the movie is a kind of stupid 1 extra point for the nice Earth view CGI,2
8 November 2013,Boring,You can throw all the technical razzamatazz at the screen you want You can tempt us with sumptuous visuals and eye popping 3D effects But when a film is boring its boring Sandra Bullock drifting through space talking to herself is boring George Clooney acting like a wise ass with a heart is boring Seeing floating debris and explosions in space when you never feel anyone is in danger is boring Attempts at sentimentality using the hoariest clich s in the screenplay book is boring Writing this review now is boring In fact I think I ll stop Right now Cos I m bored The most overrated movie since Inception 3 10,3

24 October 2013,HK Auteur Review - Gravity,In my opinion the key to making special effects convincing on screen is designing the effect to look somewhere between real and unreal When the audience can t figure out what s real and what s not they will believe it This is what happened to me during Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity Since Children of Men Alfonso Cuar n takes his love of the long take and brings it to new levels I couldn t figure out how these long shots were accomplished The camera floats freely around the astronauts in space in long takes occasionally shifting from third person perspective to first person The camera loops twirls corkscrews around space completely forgoing the human sense of up and down It looked like the cameraman was really floating around with the actors I knew that wasn t possible But eventually I tapped out and let the movie spectacle just wash over me As science fiction thematically explores the extreme potential of mankind awe is an important component to every science fiction story I was in sheer awe through the entirety of Gravity Firstly outer space and the beauty of Earth from a distance awed me Then there was the solemn beauty of witnessing the space stations being decimated in space I began to marvel at the destruction and momentarily thought deep thoughts It was as if for a second I was watching waves wash ashore on a beach while reading J Krishnamurti Finally I was awed by the fragility of human life After all all astronauts are just little fishes trying to survive out of their own habitat The experience was otherworldly self reflective and dangerous all at the same time I walked into Gravity mistakenly thinking it was a George Clooney vehicle To my surprise it s a Sandra Bullock movie Sandra Bullock has always had a natural personable quality on screen Whether it was pining for her crush to awaken from a coma in While You Were Sleeping or driving a bus that s primed to explode in Speed she s always able to draw the audience into her plight with vulnerability Bullock s characters never feel above the audience Often this quality of hers get overlooked from having to play cheerful funny characters in romantic comedies In Gravity that quality is used to its full extent We watch as she struggles to survive a series of obstacles Her performance is as immersive as the special effects She draws you in completely into her plight I wish more depth were given to her character By the beginning of the third act the film starts to run low on its spectacle and it came to the moment where more character was needed for a bigger statement Gravity elected to stay with its spectacle and jetted for the finish line It had a good ending but it was missing that final thematic punch that answers What is this story ultimately about and Why am I watching this And for that Gravity is a great gem and one exhilarating thrill ride I am even happy that it was a great role for Sandra Bullock I just do not know if the thrills will be as compelling on subsequent viewings So in the end it is not a masterpiece but a very awesome movie nonetheless For more reviews please visit my film blog http hkauteur wordpress com,8
20 November 2013,The intensity of the experience covers up for the weaknesses in the events and writing,I am really not a fan of 3D I dislike that everything seems darker and a little bit harder to see and even for the big banner 3D movie Avatar it seemed like an unnecessary gimmick that didn t do enough to cover up a not particularly good film Add to this the number of films that are cheaply retrofitted with 3D for the sake of money and I really have no interest in seeing anything in 3D if I have a normal option Gravity was the exception since from what I heard it was probably worth seeing in 3D and from seeing it I can agree with this As a piece of technology Gravity is really impressive I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don t stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn t made a fuss of and doesn t get in the way of enjoying the film Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn t stop until the end Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision but in this case the feeling of being in the film really work and aside from one or two thing coming at you moments it really worked For me equally impressive was the sound engineering most sound effects are given a really satisfying via contact sound the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects The one thing to say though is that all of this probably only applies if you see it in the cinema and with the full experience because this is what it is about and it would be wrong to get sucked up in the experience and not see the weaknesses within this film Specifically these are in the content and they will be more apparent on a smaller screen The events within the film are so unlikely that without these strong aspects drawing you in they will probably be more likely to push you out of the experience to question what you are watching Attempts to add character and back story are OK but only as part of an already engaging experience mostly they are only so so and one or two rather clunky bits of symbolism really don t work That said it is not down to the cast Clooney may be very much about his calmness under pressure and his great presence but Bullock does a very good job to be vulnerable and fighting to survive and just like the effects do her performance draws you in even if the material she sometimes has to deliver has the potential to do the opposite Gravity is only 90 minutes and it moves with intensity and urgency that is effective and greatly helped by how great it is as an experience As such it will work best by far with a large screen and those silly overpriced glasses on because it is all about this and in this context the weaknesses are less impacting but there are weaknesses and they do have an impact and I suspect that as the film moves onto smaller screens these will be more apparent,
28 February 2014,Absolutely unique and spellbinding.,I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a score of 1 I just don t get this as Gravity is one of the most creative and visually striking films I ve ever seen The only film that reminds me of it somewhat is Avatar where an entire world is created digitally much like in Gravity However Gravity is very much unlike Avatar is most every other way and represents an interesting what if scenario in this near future sci fi film The date in which the film is set is uncertain but is sometime in the near future In this near future the International Space Station is still in use the Chinese Space Station is up and running and the Americans once again have a shuttle program The film begins with an American space mission in progress A scientist Sandra Bullock is working on fixing her pet space project while being overseen by an experienced astronaut George Clooney Without warning a series of explosions emanating from a Russian satellite create a chain effect launching space debris everywhere and destroying the shuttle and severely damaging the two nearby space stations Unfortunately at this point only the two astronauts are left alive but not for long unless truly extraordinary events take place that allow them to return to Earth I was worried that I d find the film boring After all 13 minutes into the movie you are left with two living characters and you see no others for the duration of the film Yet inexplicably the script and direction keep the film from being dull There are no lulls and the action and acting really work well together and suck you into the film I have rarely felt as tense as I did as I watched the movie and many times I found myself moving about in my seat along with the action Technically the film was amazing Using the actors faces a CG world was created that looked real You really felt that it was filmed in space and the physics were really awesome I rarely use words like awesome or amazing in my reviews but this IS the only way to describe the technical prowess of the film While I am sure physicists and rocket scientists could spot a few flaws here and there the film makes it all seem so plausible and real that I cannot help but admire and love the film Do yourself a favor see this film and try to see it on the big screen,10

9 March 2014,1/2 star,1 2 half star for the wire green screen CGI 0 zero stars for the rest Who cares about accuracy and education with our fantasy 1 Anyone who has watched NASA TV broadcasts of shuttle Hubble ISS walks will laugh at all the stupid dialogue that this movie pushes forward as a reality 2 The Russians as joint participants would never use a missile to experimentally blow up a satellite close to any working space endeavor And there are much easier ways to allow a satellite to de orbit and burn And just to test missile capability for satellites again there are much easier alternatives 3 Although space junk and natural space entities can reach relative speeds in the tens of thousands of mph it is far fetched to have so much debris accumulatively arrive so quickly 4 Velocity and acceleration is far more fine tunable with pressurized gas from a MMU so all that flying about was a bit excessive Even the movement by hand seemed excessive 5 The talking out loud dialogue presented by Bullock would be comical to any who has faced life ending desperate situations 6 Clooney s scenes were just as far fetched 7 The tumbling escape module all aflame with heat tiles rarely in a position to help should have left her as a cinder 8 The landing in a lake removal of suit do you know how long most people can hold their breath in a relaxed safe environment walking out of the water like after a dip in the Mediterranean pleassssee,1
28 September 2013,"A thrilling ride from start to end, must see on the big screen in 3D",Just returned from seeing this at the Haifa Film Festival As an astronomy enthusiast I thoroughly enjoyed Gravity It was more absorbing than any movie I can remember in recent history and probably the closest most of us will get to being in space any time soon The stunning visuals combined with great 3D work and sound effects totally draw you into orbit right along Sandra for the 90 minutes it lasts By the way the teaser trailer does not do Gravity justice but it was nice to be pleasantly surprised for a change Plot wise it s not the most sophisticated film ever Hollywood couldn t resist some of its usual manipulations no need to elaborate here you ll know it when you see it but in this case it s forgiven,9

15 April 2016,Gravity -- much more than a space movie!,Gravity pulled me in right from the start The cinematography of Earth and space is stunningly breathtaking The CGI was flawless lending the impression of actually being there I can t remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly Gravity is a film that takes place in space but it is SO much more than just a space movie I identified with Sandra Bullocks character on a couple levels and I felt like I was in her place at the final scene Gravity It pulls us down It places us solidly where we are It defines us There is no escaping the reality although sometimes we try Sometimes all we need to do is let go and let gravity bring us home Questions that the film conjured in me Where do we escape What causes us to awaken How do we pick up ourselves against the weight of the world and learn to walk again Who are we really when we are stripped down to our core To feel the pain the fear the loss of dreams amidst each breath To try again To never give up To heal To dare embrace life To love,10

5 October 2013,Go but lower your expectations,The more I watched the trailer the less I was sure I wanted to spend the money to see it I am glad I went but it is not something I would see again The visual is very good If you go see it you must see it in IMAX 3D or don t see it at all It is great to see views of the earth from space and also nice to see extreme closeups of the Hubble the shuttle and the ISS both inside and outside The 3D was so realistic I blinked a few times as things came flying toward the screen As for the story don t even both paying much attention Just sit back and watch the visuals and ignore the story The believability is not even in the near vicinity of this universe There is almost nothing about this movie that is any way related to how things like this would happen in space I would go so far as to say you could take along earplugs and not listen to the story Just watch the visuals,6
16 February 2014,Dull and Boring,Judging by the high votes my opinion seems to be a pretty unusual one but come on A Hundred Million dollars for THIS How can a Director with so much cash at his disposal allow scenes to be left In the finished Movie where Bubbles can clearly be seen In the Underwater shots See Goofs for best example We would be forgiven for thinking that In this day and age Writers Directors Producers i e The whole Movie making world would with such Information technology freely available on such a massive scale no longer make obvious mistakes regarding the laws of Physics In Space Sadly many such silly mistakes are evident throughout this Movie and there really Is no excuse for It But the main problem Is It s boring Okay so space Is pretty empty on a Human scale of course and so we can t expect much In terms of Interesting photography at the best of times but let s face It In this case the vast majority of the dialogue Is far from thrilling either Science Fiction has always been a favourite of mine but this certainly won t be one I ll ever watch again I barely managed to stay awake,1

10 December 2013,only view it for the visual experience,As many other reviewers here I have no clue as to which movie the prof reviewers have seen Apparently it s not the same movie that i saw What i saw was stunning visuals bad story telling bad story writing one dimensional characters and a ton of supposed realism gone out the window I felt like the movie tried to sell me on something that could be real and i found that it showed me a fairy tale without much realism The plot was so thin and the realism of the movie so low that i know for sure i will never watch this movie again Because unlike a lot of other movies it will never have anything new for me or interesting And when you have seen it once you can sum it up again in 10 seconds or less Do me a favour and never ever pay full price for this pos,4
6 July 2023,"As ""science fiction"", Alfonso Cuarón presents us with an epic, that is, a work strongly rooted in reality, which at certain times works almost like a documentary",In Gravity the fear doesn t come from an alien In the plot astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney is on a mission to repair the Hubble telescope along with doctor Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock who is making her first flight This introduction shows the astronauts exchanging minor conversations with the mission control center in Houston voiced by Ed Harris who here almost reprises his role from Apollo 13 Suddenly the astronauts are surprised by a warning to interrupt the mission due to a shower of debris resulting from the destruction of a satellite by a Russian missile The wreckage of the satellite thrown into outer space is on a collision course for the astronauts who are soon hit Ryan is thrown and wanders lost through space until Matt who here looks more like a western cowboy for his lines and behavior manages to lasso the character of Bullock Together the two need to make their way to the international space station to try to get back home It is clear that midway through the journey there will be a lack of oxygen the wreckage will hit the duo again and everything will seem to conspire against the two The successes of the films undeniably account for the technical part It is impossible not to be surprised by the visual form found by director Alfonso Cuar n from the excellent And Your Mother Too from 2001 to narrate the drama of astronauts lost in space Cameras use and abuse in the best possible way different angles capable of impressing Hardly has the Earth seen from space been so beautifully portrayed as here The film is the sum of extremely tense long shots almost no dialogue and no sound other than diegetic sounds and a parsimonious but potent soundtrack by Steven Price which blends into the images exquisitely starting with the deafening opening made solely to enhance the silence that follows Cuar n who also co wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas and worked on the perfect montage with Mark Sanger created a simple even basic but visceral story of survival told through long blunt takes of a technical brilliance that has long been unheard of Sees and which they mimic while swallowing Cuar n s own sequence shots in Children of Men As science fiction the director presents us with an epic of the so called hard science that is a work strongly rooted in reality which at certain times works almost like a documentary There is Kowalksi s flying backpack the space shuttle the Hubble telescope the International Space Station and a Chinese space station which if it doesn t already exist has concrete plans to be launched in the very near future The dialogues are all functional and reveal procedures that may well be the exact replica of what would happen in such a situation They are expository to a certain extent but organic at all times The effects of gravity on bodies and objects impress anyone and become an essential part of the narrative If in 2001 we had velcro shoes to prevent the stewardess from floating on the PanAm ship in Gravity we see the details of space suits and how liquids and fire too behave in a vacuum without gravity And what we see before our eyes is so impressive that even Buzz Aldrin the second man to step on the Moon in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter gave his seal to the film making it clear that what we see is really what happens It is exactly because it is a reproduction of the reality that exists today that Gravity is not an example of the science fiction genre but a thriller that takes place in space And to accomplish all of this of course there is a heavy reliance on CGI special effects tape But this dependency here is extremely positive as it is these effects that allow Cuar n s camera to walk wherever it walks without cuts to present unusual angles and to observe a breathtaking visual Nothing seems out of place Nothing feels fake over the top or less than it would if Cuar n had shot Gravity on location It s the massive use of CGI the way every director should use it to tell the story he organically wants From spectacular scenes of destruction to small details like Ryan s tears floating out of her eyes the camera panning in and out of the astronaut s helmet and ice forming on the capsule hatch the special effects mesmerize and captivate creating a believable logical and cohesive universe In outdoor scenes in open space 3D allows a depth of field that is sometimes beautiful enhancing the natural landscape that is Earth and sometimes terrifying by making us stay attentive and close to several layers of the film the astronauts in the foreground others further down and even the space shuttle all under attack from satellite debris In interior scenes inside escape pods and space stations 3D enhances the claustrophobia of these places making us closely follow the confined space and suffer along with the actors And this is all thanks to the excellent work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Cuar n s partner in Children of Men and Terrence Malick in The Tree of Life Knowing how to use extremely wide shots that easily pass into more closed shots reaching extreme close ups Lubezki and Cuar n bring out the beauty and danger of space and Dr Ryan Stone Seeking to create a narrative that grants as much respect to the word scientific as the one devoted to fiction the film avoids the absurdly common mistake of bringing disasters into space resulting in explosions and bangs which makes the destruction portrayed in Gravity even more impactful for occurring in silence and in a brutal way So most of the time the diegetic sounds that accompany actions are just those the characters would actually hear under similar circumstances the voices of each other and the command in Houston and of course the heavy breathing inside the helmet And if the genre s standard and expository dialogues are in a way the weakest point of the production they at least serve to give some necessary humanity even artificial to the central duo through their interactions and personal reports With this we perceive the security of the experienced Kowalski and the fear of his colleague who in addition to the frightening situation in which she finds herself is still surrendered to past traumas that can serve as motivating or discouraging elements depending on the moment Sandra Bullock who during half of the film only appears with her face and even so inside a huge astronaut s helmet gives an acting show in a much more natural and convincing role than the one that won her the Oscar in 2010 for The Blind Side She achieves an enormous amplitude even limited to the medium in which she is changing from a straight scientist to an astronaut adrift the tortured mother and the heroine of an action movie without ceasing to be perfectly believable for even a second George Clooney does what he has to do efficiently but the nature of his role is very different from that of Bullock so his participation is more allegorical and self conscious again thanks to the clever script that knows how to joke with the actor himself But don t expect an intricate story as already mentioned above Cuar n and his son wrote a basic adventure where the heroes have to get from point A to point B and so on with a light layer of personal drama so that we can identify with the characters Enemies are space debris and space itself not villainous humans or space monsters And we have to accept in a way certain lucks that the characters have throughout the plot but nothing that is not part of the necessary suspension of disbelief that although Cuar n demands a little more from us than usual he makes up for it by literally catapulting us into the action to the point of leaving us breathless along with Dr Ryan and allow us relief in the already classic new version of the space womb from 2001 Gravity falls into the commonplace of films typically made in Hollywood to win Oscars that of working with human beings overcoming problems that are apparently without solutions but that after much suffering these people manage to achieve victory All this drama is deposited in the character of Sandra Bullock To begin with her daughter died when she was four years old and that s why the girl s life no longer seems to have any meaning She soon gives up the fight until George Clooney s character takes on the role of saving her with strong words and catchphrases So Gravity is much closer to movies like Wall Street and Jerry Maguire Does this make production bad Not necessarily after all the look makes up for the flaws It s just a shame to see a production with so many successes not going beyond a mediated script In this aspect the film becomes predictable and from a certain point Ryan s destiny already seems clearly traced Ryan s overcoming is perceived in each scene At the end of the film the camera which before was shaky when showing Ryan changes and starts to focus from the bottom up now showing a confident determined woman like a good American willing to survive In 1968 Stanley Kubrick released 2001 A Space Odyssey based on similar principles seen in Gravity a stunning look and a particular plot eternalizing in the history of Cinema More recently in 2009 Duncan Jones brought back the space theme and made the fantastic Lunar which unfortunately went unnoticed by the mainstream media Even without the originality of the proposal not least because we are talking about Hollywood it is undeniable that Cuar n also leaves his mark on contemporary science fiction with one of the best films of 2013,8
31 May 2018,Insult to common sense,It s a well known fact that Dutch astronauts bring their skates on a space mission Likewise Americans bring their baseball bat and glove So what do you expect flying around in an abandoned Chinese spaceship A pingpong bat of course I give this movie two stars one for the graphics and one for the fact that it kept me anticipating yet another blunder There are just too many I stopped counting,2
20 January 2014,"Less Than Perfect, But Visually Stunning",A medical engineer Sandra Bullock and an astronaut George Clooney work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space Obviously this film has garnered the attention and accolades it has because of the special effects and visually stunning design And there is no arguing that this looks amazing with or without the IMAX and 3D Some have called it this year s Life of Pi or Avatar and there is plenty of truth to that Others have been critical of its scientific accuracy which seems odd Sure Bullock is not wearing space diapers and not everything might have behaved how it would in zero gravity situations But this is hardly the point The chances of anyone surviving in this scenario are basically nil so just accept that it is fiction and give them a little bit of wiggle room to tell the story As for the story itself I was not terribly impressed The themes of isolation desperation hopelessness and hope are all good ones and I have to give them credit for providing a fair range for Bullock s character Others have pointed out the spiritual symbolism which I concede was lost on me and may be one reason I think it was not the masterpiece others have said The praise is near universal with critic A O Scott saying that the film in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them How do you top that James Cameron stated I think it s the best space photography ever done I think it s the best space film ever done and it s the movie I ve been hungry to see for an awful long time Which coming from the leader of cutting edge film technology is the highest of compliments With regard to the Academy Awards the film earned ten nominations tying it with American Hustle many of which are in the technical categories and it sincerely deserves to win those awards Director Alfonso Cuaron known for his Harry Potter film and Y Tu Mama Tambien among others really went out on a limb here and should be recognized for that He won the Golden Globe and I think he deserves the Oscar too To helm such a project takes intestinal fortitude few besides perhaps Cameron could muster Bullock as best actress is debatable Although much was done by computer animation and thus amounts to more or less voicing a cartoon the parts she physically appeared in deserve respect and admiration Bullock stayed in a special mechanical rig for up to ten hours a day communicating with others only through a headset That is dedication that was not matched by Amy Adams or Meryl Streep Best score I could accept though I do not feel strongly about it one way or the other Steven Price at age 36 is a relative newcomer and it would be nice to see him enter the world of Hans Zimmer and John Williams But is this his time Lastly best picture And I say no Much like Ang Lee received best director for Life of Pi but failed to get best picture I think the same could be said here The direction and cinematography are excellent but is this a film that will resonate in years to come I have my doubts The emotional impact simply is not there,7

24 November 2013,Saving Scientist Ryan,One of the biggest grossing films of the year and one of RYM s highest ranking movies number 60 all time as I write and it s only just come out No shortage of expectation on my part then as I donned the 3D glasses and sat in for show time Well I was disappointed I can see it s a technical wonder with its depiction of life in space both inside and outside a space station but frankly the lack of drama never mind action very much bored me in my seat It s very hard to convey character garbed in a space suit whirling around the cosmos you can barely see the actors faces for the first hour or so I found nothing greatly original in the very thin story line either and some of the quirky character traits either overly sentimental Bullock s loss of her young daughter or just plain irritating Clooney s country and western music predilection I appreciate the difficulty of one solitary character carrying a film but The Spirit Of St Louis and The Old Man And The Sea in their depictions of human kind s battles against earlier frontiers managed it and while I liked that it was a woman rather than a man who carried the film Sandra Bullock is no James Stewart or Spencer Tracy I m no expert in these things but her ability to successfully navigate her weightless way around the spacecrafts of two foreign countries and just by picking up conveniently situated manuals actually fly the things and engineer her escape to miraculously land on water yards from shore all beggared belief Watching this film was like sitting in a theme park simulator okay for 10 but certainly not for 90 whole minutes,4
10 January 2014,Brevity,It s a modern ninety minute short film therefore it s probably a great film without even looking full stop Most new films stretch out longer than their event horizon with cgi cartoonery too daft to laugh at and say less than this one s end credits But however entertaining this might possibly be it s still as vacuous as the space that is the er real star at least the ninety minutes didn t drag though Two astronauts Buzz Clooney and Ripley Bullock the entire cast are tinkering around a space ship when debris from space collision causes space mayhem and serious space problems for them to get back to safety There s some gripping and some risible moments always complemented with eye boggling cgi although this is a live action cartoon it looks real to me at all times is that partly because we all know Americans with their backs against the airlock are always as resourceful as this If I d seen this with some Buddy Holly 3D specs in the cinema I might have come away seasick so thank the Lord I didn t Without the 3D gimmick it s a film easier to concentrate on and criticise for its empty headed plot And why off Earth did I keep reminiscing about Fireball XL5 I d watch this again when it s on the telly in the future as a slot filler as no big loss But it certainly was fantastic and space breaking work by the legions of cartoonists and technicians it looks great appears heavy ends up lightweight,8

18 February 2015,Hmmm...,Like many films I want to watch I do read reviews here and positives ones plus the average score made me think it is a good one Well it was not I can not say it is totally awful but it is pretty much close to it Besides the fact that nothing happens and that I was waiting whole time something to happen nothing is the right word to describe this film I do not like Sandra very much but in comedies she is totally fine But add her to a boring film the result is zero interest for me I guess some beautiful scenes of the universe is what saved this one not to get one from me You lose nothing if you skip it,2

11 January 2022,GRAVITY....You Don't SEE It....But You Sure as Heaven EXPERIENCE It!,Long Live Alfonso Cuaron Que Viva Alfonso Cuaron In just a few hundred words I will now try to do the film its director and cast Sandra Bullock George Clooney justice The Seventh Art is a term that seems to have fallen into disuse during the past 20 or 30 Years GRAVITY s director Alfonso Cuaron Children of Men has not only resuscitated but also reinvented it adding a signature spin all his own Where is it written that a movie s commercial success is almost always inversely proportionate to its artistic Intellectual and aesthetic quality GRAVITY most certainly brings to mind the adage The exception proves the rule When this review was being written Gravity was rated 8 5 on IMDb with 184 000 Votes placing it in the all time film top 75 just behind The LION KING and just ahead of REQUIEM FOR a DREAM OK Now some Years later it has slipped to a 7 7 Rating Not GREAT But surely Very Good Truly great films are both original and work on multiple levels How specifically does this one manage so much in just 90 minutes Alfonso Cuaron s artisitic and poetic visuals enable us to view his reality through the eyes of a cinematic genius A glimmering tear floating aimlessly impacts the viewer with a Tsunami of emotion The breathtaking yet surreal backdrop of hovering earth and stars provides an ever present reminder of both our relative insignificance on a cosmic scale and the fleetingness of our problems however transcendent they may seem to us in the moment GRAVITY communicates more via imagery and resourceful subtle yet intense acting than it does through dialog Here the dialog mostly serves as a buffer a veneer to calm and disguise extremely turbulent inner emotions Some of life s great tragedies are framed in the most insipid of words There is genuinely something for everyone here If gut wrenching is what you seek there are some chaotic frenetic and viscerally charged moments Almost forgot to mention GRAVITY s use of 3 D is never over the top in your face nor employed gratuitously It is deftly and strategically used to highlight on screen occurrences not to detract from them or be the sole or even central focus per se Bullock s character Dr Stone who at first seems utterly driven to achieve perfection is in reality locked into a self induced drone like state of professional isolation resulting from a profound loss she seemingly refuses to come to terms with The intense innner conflict this causes her and Bullock s ability to involve the audience in her character s catharsis translates into moments of overwhelming poignancy Why is her performance Oscar worthy Ms Bullock literally carries the entire last half of the movie solely on her shoulders Her performance is tersely awe inspiring Very few Hollywood actresses could pull this off And to think that initially she wasn t on the short list for the role George Clooney s character larger than life veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski is the jovial kind of guy who can be a bit of an hole at times but amazes you with his simple selfless professionalism when it really counts In this supporting role the on screen platonic chemistry with Sandra Bullock is absolutely uncanny Honestly some of the very best I have ever seen Lastly in addition to gut grabbing heart involving and mentally engaging GRAVITY does what only one film in a 1 000 manages It captures your soul Some really fine films try to provide the right answers After experiencing GRAVITY you ll be asking yourself many of the right questions ENJOY DISFRUTELA 10,10

29 October 2013,"Astonishing, Technically Brilliant and Very Moving",I saw Gravity on opening weekend and was so overwhelmed by the visuals that I went a second time on the same weekend to absorb the rest of the film once the novelty of the visuals had worn off I wish I had posted my comments then because now that it s become a phenomenon my review is just so much white noise and to those who are determined to hate Gravity because it s so popular I ll be easy to dismiss as just one more lemming But I did love Gravity I thought it was an absolutely beautiful movie a story about loss grief and rekindled hope disguised as a simple space survival story It affected me very deeply and moved me to tears a few times sometimes through the strength of its message sometimes through the wonderful performance of Sandra Bullock and at other times from the sheer visual beauty of the film I can understand why others wouldn t be moved by the film one of the things I love most about cinema is the subjective reactions audiences have to it but I can t believe that anyone who purports to love movies won t at least acknowledge the sheer technical filmmaking mastery on display in this movie Alfonso Cuaron has vaulted to the top of my list of favorite directors on the strength of this and Children of Men another of his films that slugged me with an emotional punch to the gut He s the rare director who can make us marvel at the technical achievements he s putting up on the screen even while he s touching us deeply with an emotional connection In that way he s a much less maudlin and sentimental version of Steven Spielberg I m almost disappointed that Gravity has become so popular because it s the kind of movie I responded very personally to and now it s going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and all we ll hear about between now and February of 2014 is how it doesn t deserve all of its acclaim Grade A,10
10 December 2013,Rent-A-Review strikes again!,I wonder what percentage of the budget was spent on reviews Going off the glowing reviews I see here my guess is that Rent A Review have been working overtime again In fact I think this is the most blatant case of review fixing I think I have ever seen I could possibly understand people being impressed by the CGI and maybe giving it a 5 10 based on that but anything more than 5 10 is ridiculous and an insult to anyone with an IQ greater than that of a gherkin I was contemplating giving the movie just 1 10 but the effects were quite good I had even considered giving it 3 or maybe 4 out of 10 based on the effects but special effects don t make a movie at least not for me and all the special effects in the world won t change the fact that this movie is crap I recently watched a time lapse video of the earth taken from the International Space Station and I can categorically state hand on heart that the video from the ISS was far more entertaining than this pathetic offering It s a sad day when this sorry excuse for a movie ranks higher than Blade Runner which is arguably the best sci fi movie of all time Maybe it s time that IMDb took a long hard look at their voting review system because based on what I ve seen here it just isn t working,1
27 February 2014,Suspenseful and exhilarating.,Gravity was a very unique and original movie and because it was also executed incredibly well it was a great movie and deserves much of the praise it has received The special effects cinematography perfect amount of first person angles sound and lack of development all create a certain sense of unknown and suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat almost from the beginning The acting essentially Sandra Bullock is also very good albeit slightly overrated While it isn t the movie of the year in my opinion it is still an exceptional film and one of the few movies I ve ever seen that I felt like 3D added something rather than taking something away,8
4 October 2013,Grand Elevation,Gravity doesn t seem like a big epic film like what most Sci Fi pictures are treated today The concept is quite simple but despite of being simple it s surprisingly more of a rewarding experience than you would expect The real idea of the film is to portray how nature can bring both wonder and danger within the universe The movie takes place in space but there s definitely no alien twists to consider because gravity and physics themselves are already their enemy and all you have to do is to take its ride like you ve never seen space before The genius of the film is just being simple but what s extraordinary is how it elevates the use of CGI and a direction giving us a good amount of suspense we need for a space thriller Gravity is a cinematic experience that anyone shouldn t miss The plot is indeed straightforward in spite of some scenes when the astronauts are talking about their personal lives The rest is all amazingly put together set pieces where danger can happen anytime and anywhere it can be a struggle by the difficult movement in space satellite debris destroying anything that passes or just losing oxygen Watching these characters trying survive the disaster going on is technically the only plot here and how the film realized these incidents is astounding I think the most memorable feat is whenever a soundless destruction occurs as the music score s beat replaces the clash But really most of the time is built in tension and while everything is supposed to look terrifying it also looks quite spectacular But it s not always about the the terror the film is already remarkably stunning with the marvelous perspectives that the camera picks Most of its shots linger as it flies around from people to people and place to place and it rarely shifts angles until it actually needed to This brilliant camera work makes you feel like you re part of the ride which is pretty obvious for a film like this Big budgeted CGI is usually used for blockbusters to impress the audience how cool the movie looks but this is one of those that is able to be both cool and electrifying Looking at planet Earth is indeed a breathtaking view that may give you goosebumps until an equally spellbinding peril happens up there It of course had some human elements but it works better in the exhaustion and longing of the characters situation than the drama they make about their backstories The performances makes it all easy to relate if not nuanced This is most of the time Sandra Bullock s show and she controls the role decently And George Clooney is always likable in any of his scenes Gravity is a magnificent achievement It can also be an alternative to the genre in a while since Sci Fi is recently or has always been taken over by epics with aliens and giant robots or whatever but never forget what s scarier than those myths simply just how force of nature works This review probably sounds too hyperbolic that some might expand their expectations One thing people should know about Gravity is it s a very simple film with a very simple story and concept but by Alfonso Cuar n s strong ambition all of its elements are perfectly fit together As a result an experience that may stuck in your memory for a long time Gravity is easily one of the best films of the year and again it should be seen in theaters either 3D or not,10

25 December 2022,Great Survival Film,Gravity is one of those movies that I don t really think about that often when thinking of the great movies but when reminded of it it is looked back upon with fondness Absolutely breathtaking special effects that still look very good almost a decade later Everything about this movie on a technical level is just sheer genius Visuals sound design cinematography George Clooney and Sandra Bullock also give great performances The story is pretty simple and I ll admit there were a few lines of dialogue that came off a little goofy I liked the survival aspect of it and there was some interesting imagery here with Bullock s character floating in space like a fetus the shot mimicking human evolution toward the end of the film Deep themes of fate and Murphy s Law Check it out and watch it on the biggest screen you have if you have a nice home theater set up you ll really enjoy this with the surround sound turned up and on a high resolution screen,9
2 March 2022,A visually stunning thrill ride,This film serves up an experience no other has achieved it takes you into space with such effect that you believe you are there alongside the protagonists Then it adds amazing special affects as everything that makes space somewhere that a human can survive is obliterated in spectacular fashion You cannot take your eyes off the screen Some have criticised a lack of plot I disagree Here is the most elemental plot of all survival against all the odds Here is the deepest human question the value of life I forgot to breathe as I watched this Amazing,10
27 August 2018,Possibly the most visually incredible film I've seen.,Five years after its release I thought it was time to watch it Seven Oscars which largely were awarded for sounds and visuals and you can see why it is a beautiful film the visuals are jaw dropping it really is a game changer in terms of sci fi movies The music is also incredible it really does help increase the film s tension The story itself is quite simple but very effective all events revolving around the concept of gravity It is incredibly clever superbly written with thought given to cause and effect the whole way through It is so bleak that anything that can go wrong does go wrong Sandra Bullock is great as is Russell Crowe for the time he s in it I m glad I ve seen it I wouldn t rush to watch it again as it doesn t perhaps have enough content for me personally but I get why people would deem it a masterpiece A thrill for the senses visually sensational 8 10,8
12 July 2022,a graphic masterpiece.,What was done in this movie in terms of the graphical effects is surreal Simple story not so realistic but that manages to push the plot well George s character with his funny way comes to relieve the tensions experienced by Sandra The film is good don t expect anything from the plot as it is a bit simple but visually the film is excellent,7
2 March 2014,"Gravity is one of the most beautiful, gripping, intense, moving, and downright satisfying movies I've ever seen.",Have you ever seen a moment in a movie where it gives you a certain feeling inside I like to call them Pixar moments We ve all been there We see a Pixar movie most likely Toy Story Toy Story 3 and every movie in between and we feel something It s a combination of satisfaction heart and strong emotions That s the impact that Gravity left on me but instead of one part of the movie it was the entire thing This movie stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who are astronauts They are on their normal day job when all of a sudden lots of debris flies at them Sandra Bullock gets separated from them and she has to find her way back to Earth I am really bad at describing movie plots And it s to describe this one because it is so well written and well executed that I don t want to spoil it Not only is the plot very intense but it s also realistic Astronauts have to deal with this all the time and it s a scary thought when it does happen That s also something I should bring up This movie does a great job at keeping you on the edge of your seat There s lots of destruction but with the added bonus of zero gravity and no oxygen it makes for one heck of a ride And I like how the destruction looks and sounds When you see the debris fly you know that crap is about to go down And let s not forget that in space there is no sound so when debris does hit everything it s not a loud crash but a quiet thud It s like the sound that is made when you tap a microphone It s very well done The acting is well done too Sandra Bullock definitely stole the show She does a great job at reacting to her surroundings and doing her scenes in general George Clooney had a great performance too His character is the confident talkative type and that really worked for this role He even looks like an astronaut That s a plus The cinematography is some of the best I ve ever seen in my entire life The camera displays everything in a swooping motion like the camera is in space too And how the scenes are set up is just amazing I heard that every scene they had to do was choreographed so specifically They had to know when to move and when to react to things That added to the realistic factor and I liked it And know it s time for the big one the special effects HOLY GUACA STINKING MOLE They are without a doubt the best special effects I have ever seen in my entire life Everything looks absolutely beautiful from the stars to the sunrise to the Earth itself It really feels like you the viewer are in space with them and that adds to the movie a lot Overall this movie was a masterpiece This is one of those rare movies where while viewing you can t think of anything you wished you would ve liked changed or done differently Gravity is in my top four favorite movies of all time up there with the three Lord of the Rings movies I loved this movie and I can t wait to see it again on Saturday If you haven t seen this movie please please please watch it This movie is amazing,10

27 February 2014,A great sci fi flick with pull,Visually Gravity is the most beautiful and enthralling film I ve ever seen Watching it on just a Dell computer screen lights off amazed me I actually felt I was there if at times in the actual actor s shoes Slumped back in my seat I just got lost in the cinematography God knows what it s like in 3D or at the Imax theatre Our two acting heavy weights Clooney and Bullock turn in good performances especially Bullock when the helmet comes off Although she s a stereotyped actress given these independent woman roles like a few other actresses to name Clooney honestly I just wanted him to shut the f k up He really got annoying whether helmet on or off The plot borrows or unintentionally borrows the catalyst similar to that of an old 80 s sci fi flick Starflight One What we ve got here is a space station attacked by chunks of metal from another exploding vessel puncturing and tearing up the station leaving Clooney and Bullock as the only two survivors who get separated where fatally only one is left standing Gravity s script starts off better with Clooney and Bullock talking co ordinates whatever where later it s just cross conversation but interesting and thought provoking dialogue from Clooney still a narcissistic p ck Bullocks transportation from space back to ground zero where in many seconds we re no longer viewing satellite is something that must be seen like this movie Though it s not worthy of Oscar nomination for film no way Gravity is worth the watch alone for it s cinematography and it s brilliantly fitting music score,9

27 October 2013,beautiful cinematography,The movie goer is transported to a place the vast majority of us will never go I now have a greater respect for astronauts besides the technical side of their work the personal side comes out and the working with other nations in space Ryan is the newbie a medical trained astronaut who is running from a sad event in her life as she says she drives With an experienced astronaut they are subjected to a happening that probably could happen Their dependence on each other and then the training that makes for the rest of the story they are smart The best part of the story is the cinematography the filming is amazing and I admire the director and all who were able to do this film it is one of the best Even though there are some things not true you do believe it when you see it I have read about this and admire the actors for what they did I m sure it was a challenge in many ways I really liked this file but with what I consider a really great film I cannot get it out of my mind for several days I saw this yesterday and that has not happened with it But the cinematography did it is worthy of an Oscar,8
11 May 2021,but nah how cringe,Sure nice visuals but really boring on all other fronts Acring is really not that good Some CGI aged terribly Some awful 3d gimmicks and a nonexisting story with terrible writing So sure its nice to look at but apart form that its void of significicance 4 10 acutally bad,4
8 September 2014,Over-Overrrated!,I just got back from watching the film and to be honest I feel it is rather overrated It is no doubt a visual marvel and will be a hit However for me it just got kind of boring after a while and I didn t really engage with the tension I thought Bullock s character was annoying and generic and George Clooney while being likable was playing George Clooney I think it s a good film but not film of the year and far from the best space movie ever It s a feast for the eyes but nothing more The physics were wrong in some parts of the movie which annoyed me greatly and Bullock is simply frustrating to watch and listen to the movie quickly turns into her story and i fell asleep her story was not that interesting and i did not care whether or not she died,2
6 October 2013,"Did the producers of ""Gravity"" pay for glowing reviews?",Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,6
26 June 2014,I Have A Really Bad Feeling About This Mission,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
13 November 2013,An outstanding visual space film,Gravity is an outstanding visual film directed by Alfonso Cuaron crammed with some lovely area views and excellent 3D effects that were used in an appropriate manner to create an extraordinary CGI appearance I enjoyed the movie but didn t find it to be one of the very best of the year The problem with this movie is the story technically it s a flawless masterpiece and the 3D is amazing with a strong performance by Sandra Bullock but the story is thin and predictable Bullock does give one of the better performances of the year and the man vs nature storyline is always a compelling one but this movie mainly works as an amazingly beautiful visual feast and little more Overall Gravity is technically sound and very likable but looking back you might wonder what the movie was about If you accept Gravity as pure popcorn munching fun and nothing else you won t go away disappointed,8
27 February 2014,'I hate space.',Father and son team Alfonso Cuar n and Jon s Cuar n wrote the screenplay with assistance from George Clooney and Alfonso Cuar n directed with capable assistance from director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki what is likely to go down in cinematic history as a shining moment of the art of the craft It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless It is a staggering achievement Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky George Clooney in command of his last flight before retiring But on a seemingly routine spacewalk disaster strikes The shuttle is destroyed leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible This is a film that must be seen to understand and appreciate the little miracle Alfonso Cuar n has created,10
8 October 2013,Art!,Alfonso Cuar n has a way of hooking into the viewer emotionally and he did so again with this film The movie was gripping suspenseful and expressive I felt as if I was right there with Bullock going through everything that she was going through The scenery throughout the film was so stunning and overwhelming that I almost felt unworthy of watching it I m not an astronaut or scientist so I can t comment on how accurate the depiction of space was but I sure did appreciate the visuals I was hooked I was scared I cried I laughed and I questioned what I could do to make my life better This is the effect watching this film had on me Alfonso Cuar n doesn t just direct movies He creates art like a painting And any good painting incites emotion So that s what watching his films does to me This movie was definitely a 10 from start to finish,10

16 March 2014,"A massive disappointment, but certainly a beautiful one",Movies in space are as common as they come be it the shaky sets and questionable science of the 1940 s and 50 s the camp and kitschy 60 s and 70 s the alien filled deep space of the 80 s and 90 s or the explosive CGI of nowadays audiences have always had a thirst for space opera and film makers have always had a vision of the great darkness above the sky But never has it seemed so real so beautiful and so utterly terrifying as it is in Gravity Alfono Cuaron s first movie since the excellent Children of Men 2006 It is a truly stellar vision possibly the finest use of special effects ever Yet oddly I kinda hated Gravity because for all it s promise and early vigour it s just your average Hollywood popcorn muncher wrapped in a pretty bow Deep into a space mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope rookie engineer Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock focuses on her work while the wily veteran Matt Kowalski George Clooney hums pop tunes and makes cocky remarks Suddenly they are hit by high speed debris from a Russian satellite and are flung into space Their shuttle Explorer is destroyed and their entire crew dead and their only hope is to float across the great nothing to a Chinese space station where they hope to re connect with Houston and find a way home But with the debris quickly making it s way back around and the perils of nothingness in their way Stone is faced with some quick and tough decisions It s a shame I didn t get to see this in the cinema as although I m not a fan of the 3D revolution the staggering visuals and wonderful cinematography would have no doubt complimented the medium Space here is a terrifying beast the first time cinema has really captured how vast it really is When Stone is first flung away from the Hubble she spins manically out of control reaching out for objects that aren t there screaming when there s no one there to hear her Of course smooth operator Kowalski is on hand to fly out and rescue her but in those few minutes of desperation she is truly alone Yet away from the action Gravity dabbles in terrible ham fisted dialogue familiar disaster movie set pieces and heavy handed metaphorical imagery about birth death and life This is the kind of film that has lines like you ve got to learn to let go and clear skies with a chance of satellite debris Normally I would brush this off as your typical pap but I wanted and expected so much more from Gravity After the heart pounding opening 20 minutes the film begins to drag and actually feels long for a movie of just 90 minutes Bullock s character is meant to an underdog sympathetic in her never say die attitude but she comes off as inept and annoying and I fail to see why the Academy found her performance worthy of an nomination A massive disappointment but certainly a beautiful one www the wrath of blog blogspot com,4
30 January 2014,"Impossible to Be Described, Must Be Experienced in 3D Movie Theaters",The veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney is in charge of the Shuttle Explorer s STS 157 mission to repair of the Hubble Telescope by the rookie specialist Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock Out of the blue Houston control aborts the mission warning that a Russian missile hit a satellite causing a chain reaction and now there is a storm of debris coming upon them Soon they lose communication with the Mission Control in Houston The debris strike the Explorer and Ryan is released from the shuttle and Kowalski is forced to bring her back to the shuttle However the Explorer is completely damaged and now their only chance to return to Earth is to reach another space station But they are short of oxygen and fuel Gravity is a movie absolutely original and different and impossible to be described in words The only way to understand the reason for 10 nominations to the Oscar and another 79 wins and 81 nominations is experiencing Gravity in 3D Movie Theaters Alfonso Cuar n associated high technology with magnificent performances and Sandra Bullock was nominated to the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role and this is also remarkable The movie transmits anxiety distress and anguish to the viewer mainly because of the performance of Sandra Bullock that is wonderful as actress and woman My vote is ten Title Brazil Gravidade Gravity Note On 12 February 2014 I saw this movie again,10
2 March 2014,"Boring. Pedantic. 5 minutes worth of ""real material.""",Incredibly boring and simplistic plot Pedantic performances particularly by Bullock Whiz bang CGI is nothing more than porn to the Oscar voting crowd Whatever Hollywood produces they have to vote for They have to vote for something and give an Oscar to something however shallow uninteresting boring pedantic etc Too bad Clooney wasted his time on this one And the plot would have been much better if Bullock s character would have bought it within the first 5 minutes In fact the whole movie should have been 5 minutes long That s pretty much how much real material the film had 5 minutes The end Boring Stupid Pedantic Move on,1
18 July 2014,cool special effects,but not a lot happens This isn t a space adventure Some astronauts are out in space out of their shuttle working on something and nasa lets them know a satellite has been damaged and there will be flying debris They don t get inside fast enough and get hit be the debris Some die and two survive floating in space trying to get to the next orbiting satellite Some more things happen and with the right amount of luck one of the astronauts Ryan can make it back to earth I didn t think it was that great of a role for Sandra Bullock I m surprised she was nominated There just wasn t much for her character to do FINAL VERDICT Drifting and turning in space was cool and it was a short concise story just not that exciting I d recommend it if you want to see a slow moving drama,6
5 January 2015,Warning: Stupid Movie!,I haven t reviewed a film in awhile but I was so appalled and insulted by this worthless childishly written and ill conceived film that I had to warn you not to see it You re going to wish you d spent your time more wisely The writers the Cuar ns don t seem to understand an awful lot namely space technology people NASA reentry realities how people speak philosophy their attempts at philosophical statements are so corny and vacuous they sound like cheesy coffee cup sayings from the 1960s and more The writing is vapid empty unbelievable the comments at times of crisis incredibly cheerful and unreal Example the character played by George Clooney whom I admire and is the one shining light in this dreadful film which he couldn t save in spite of his efforts asks the character played by Sandra Bullock what town she s from to get her mind off a crisis in space Come on guys These astronauts would already know what towns they re from by this time in their lives The writers are just dopes Sorry Another example Bullock s oxygen is low yet Clooney has her talk to him incessantly and it s all stupid small talk that makes you want to puke to stay focused notwithstanding that this very activity in real life would cause her to use up her oxygen all the faster This movie is an insult to the viewer s intelligence It plays out like those childhood games we used to play on the playground you know hey push this button see if that one works Hey it does No need for training eh Dumb dumb dumb and you re going to feel stupid if you watch this flick The only thing good are the visuals but those don t sustain a movie and they re not exactly the most state of the art stunning displays of creativity ever In fact you don t feel you ve seen anything new at all I m just really angry that Hollywood felt audiences would be so uninformed and unsophisticated that they would think this movie was anything other than what it is namely space trash Want another example of how very stupid this is Sandra Bullock spends much time in space bare legged and barefoot and actually returns home from space bare legged and barefoot and essentially wearing underwear Come on The ending too without being a spoiler is just so fantastically unreal as to make you shake your head What was the studio that put out this hopelessly clueless movie thinking Did anyone at all research what real space flight was like Doubtful Regardless this movie s ignorance of its own subject is one thing Its dialog is another It s so amateurish to make one wonder what made these guys think they could get away with their incompetence,1
21 January 2016,Space is beautiful and frightening,Sound 2 2 Stephen Price s music is alternately nightmarish and euphoric between lulls Acting Characterization 1 5 2 George Clooney is well Clooneyesque but Sandra Bullock shows palpable emotion It s easy to root for her character as a fellow human being despite her seeming incompetence as an astronaut Script Writing 0 5 2 The script is uninspired peppered with unfunny anecdotes clich d backstories and inarticulate fretting but it wisely avoids pretentious meditation on the meaning of it all for a few poignant moments of the heroine quailing in the face of death Visuals 2 2 Impeccably shot Gravity is stunning from start to finish Objects move with geometric beauty while Earth is a vivid distant dream Concept Plot Theme 1 5 2 The threat of space debris is wonderfully mundane and realistic but everything that follows the initial catastrophe requires some suspension of disbelief as survival becomes increasingly improbable Still the film adeptly captures the minuscule fragility of human existence Total Score 7 5 10 Gut Feeling 8 10 While I wondered how her character qualified for a space mission in the first place Bullock delivers a moving performance in an immersive film that is worth seeing for the cinematography alone Final Average Score 7 75,8
19 October 2013,A celebration of nature,It s pointless to talk about the technical and artistic values of this movie It s obvious and it s inevitable not to be amazed by it from photography to acting kudos for Sandra Bullock especially What I would like to point out is the movie s meaning I just got out of the theater and I m still in awe and what really got to me beneath all the visuals and everything is that this is the ultimate movie about nature It s a celebration of the complexities of nature about how we as human beings are so insignificant and weak facing it We are a tiny little thing among a vast system that s beyond our control This movie is a study on the humanity s place in the universe so it s a call for us to face the larger picture humbly and see how our lives our societies our achievements and our problems are NOT as important as they seem to be Look further your life will seem very fragile At the same time and that s the brilliance of the movie Gravity is a celebration of the human being because even though we are in fact very insignificant it is our will to life and our effort to make our lives meaningful that make us matter This is now my favorite movie ever because it s so rare to find a movie especially a Hollywood one that can speak so deeply so poetically and so subtly about life the universe and everything in 91 minutes with such astonishing grace and artistic honesty,10
4 November 2013,So So Disappointing,My wife and I were so looking forward to this movie after reading all the glowing reviews what a massive mistake that was The 3 stars I ve given the film is for the special effects that s it I don t like movie reviewers never have but so many raved about this movie I thought they couldn t all be wrong they were Trust me I m not one of those people who picks apart plots and believability I go to the movies to be entertained I don t care if that can t happen or as if anyone could do that For crying out loud I loved all the Twilight movies The biggest problem with Gravity is that you feel no sympathy or empathy for the Sandra Bullock character nothing at all It is impossible to enjoy any movie if it does not illicit any feeling for any of the characters It cost me 50 00 to see this over rated piece of garbage next time I ll read IMDb first and continue to ignore the experts,3
5 June 2021,"Scientifically inaccurate, boring plot",The only real thing i liked about the movie was the 1917 uncut feel where it almost feels as if the entire movie was done in one shot Scientifically inaccurate though which bothered me more than it should have,2
9 March 2014,Great Visual Experience! 8/10,Review What a fantastic visual experience I was wondering what the hell the director was going to do for an hour and a half with someone floating in space but after watching the film I m very impressed I can now see what people are going on about Sandra Bullock deserves all of the praise that she is getting for her performance It couldn t have been easy to show emotion whilst floating from all of the place The director cleverly added an in depth storyline to Bullocks character which made the movie watchable for everyone The main thing that is great about the movie has to be how the movie looks and feels It s extremely realistic and you really do feel the intensity and emotion throughout the movie The director has definitely upped the bar in Hollywood A Great Watch Round Up I honestly can say that I haven t seen a movie like this before The closest movie that I can think of was Moon which was also based on one character stuck in space but this concentrates on Bullocks journey to earth When the debris hit that spaceship it really did look amazing which made me think how great it must have look in 3D or in the cinema Anyway this I some of those movies that I can watch over and aver again which is very rare for me The only problem that I personally found with the film was the ending but that s just me being picky Budget 100million Worldwide Gross 708million I recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional space movies about a woman s journey down to earth 8 10,8
19 October 2013,A jaw-dropping story about the human spirit and the will to survive,Gravity is a movie about trying to survive an impossible situation and its filmmakers do something almost as difficult Create a Hollywood blockbuster that s so original and eye popping it causes the collective jaw of jaded moviegoers to drop This thriller about two astronauts stranded after a disaster in space is so harrowing because its visuals are so believable It s the rare movie where the effects are so convincing you forget they are effects at all In this day and age when every DVD seems to come with a whole batch of behind the scenes documentaries most savvy moviegoers can spot the tricks of the trade and know how most cinematic illusions are achieved So it s enormously refreshing to watch a movie that is wall to wall special effects and not be able to discern any of its secrets Director Alfonso Cuaron is known as an innovative filmmaker any movie buff who has not seen Children of Men needs to stop what they re doing this instant and go see it With this film he devised a whole new bag of tricks to get the movie from script to screen One hint Cuaron reportedly dangled the actors from wires inside a cube of LED lights I can t begin to fathom how that translated into what you see on film and I m not sure if I want to know The result is a movie that demands to be seen not only in a theater but in IMAX 3D Splurge for the more expensive ticket it s worth it As it has often been said the most spectacular effects are worthless if they re not used to tell a compelling story Cuaron knows the audience must be invested in the characters Having two likable stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney helps accomplish that aim as does a script that fleshes out their personae albeit through some clumsy exposition Clooney and Bullock are the only actors with speaking parts whose faces appear on screen but they both have such natural charisma they are all we really need to see One other key character is heard but not seen Ed Harris in a clever bit of casting reprises his Apollo 13 role as the voice of mission control Apparently it s a law in Hollywood that you can t make a realistic movie about the space program without the star of The Right Stuff being involved in some way The character moments are sprinkled into a story that unfolds at breakneck pace in near real time At a concise 91 minutes the movie is perfectly structured and a model of narrative efficiency Bullock s character barely gets a chance to catch her breath and neither does the audience Gravity is not without it flaws however Despite the movie s extremely realistic look it contains a payload bay s worth of scientific inaccuracies Allow me to go all Space Geek on you for a moment Beyond the obvious fact the space shuttles are all currently residing in museums and that one of the other spacecraft depicted in the movie does not yet exist there are other glaring problems According to this movie every man made object orbiting the earth is at the same altitude and latitude Fact They re not Some basic laws of physics also apparently don t apply in this film s universe I could go on but I won t The movie s accurate depiction of spaceflight though is less important than its emotional genuineness It s a story about the human spirit and the will to survive Bullock s character a space rookie was a doctor in her earthbound life and her backstory is a tragic one For her venturing to space is a way of escaping her pain But in facing death she discovers a newfound desire to live It s an inspiring portrayal in a movie that is itself an inspiring artistic achievement,8

10 June 2015,Like it more and more,This is a beautiful film when seeing these images from space towards earth it just looks so peaceful and beautiful like nothing can ever go wrong or disrupt the big peaceful silence but something can and does After about 10 minutes you are hooked sitting on the edge of your seat wishing hoping and sayings thank god that is not me out there This is a great sci fi thriller it is very realistic and very powerful in this deliverance of the story and sub stories I don t know it this is unrealistic or not but it really was entertaining and fantastic I think it was very hyped but after talking about it with others who have seen it I like it more and more in the beginning I might have set my hopes to high but digging into the film more gives it more meaning and the fact that this is so technically good and very well acted is amazing,7

1 November 2013,Tame and Lame! You Have Got To Be Kidding Me! Where's the Rest of the Story?,When Gravity ended my friend and I looked at each other and said simultaneously That s It We both thought the movie was far from over It s the first time in years I had to literally apologize for picking such a lousy movie for a friend to see Sandra Bullock s acting was terrible and unconvincing And she looked like she was constipated most of the time George Clooney came across just too perfect for such a life and death situation He was too much like a saint in outer space I also felt mightily deceived by both the film s movie trailer and by the official news media critics that fawned all over this pitiful movie Gravity is so tame and lame you could take a child to see it without a second thought It certainly won t offend a soul on planet earth But worst of all was the ending After you a watch a film you want to feel like there was a beginning middle and end In Gravity your jaw is left hanging because there s was no satisfying ending My friend and I both felt like we were in the the middle of the story when the film ended BORING,1

5 May 2017,"Excellent Video Effects...Then, That's About It, The Rest Is Bad",Yes Hollywood has managed to create enormously excellent video effects in movies the budgets are huge the pictures are awesome but often sadly much too often there is virtually nothing with a capital N behind this Gravity seems to be an over rated over praised and over estimated movie that is in fact a boring endless even 90 minutes may become endless and excruciating torture which never stops No Zappa here but generally even such huge luminaries as Sandra Bullock and Goerge Clooney cannot save this yawning boredom from being tedious slow and very very annoying OK this is a very dramatic story OK the main hero is a brave woman and yes she does well in such shocking circumstances Yes the Earth and space visuals are stunning Yes the sound is awesome No there is no captivating plot to grab our attention It only crawls so slow it nearly kills And yes we saw this type of plot way too often a hero saves the day Nothing new here jut the setting is different Can be seen and then forgotten,3

20 February 2014,Just a motion picture? No! The most breathtaking cinematographic experience ever? Yeaaaaaah!!!,I can not judge this film just as a motion picture Because it s something far beyond that I can only judge it as an experience for that s what it s been to me Well as an experience this film is just a unique one It took me several minutes to come back and the only critic i could then articulate when asked was a very short one I am speechless I think the ones who didn t like it or just declare so are either too f ing snobbish or just sentimentally amputated or both For how can this ever be possible for a viewer not to be overwhelmed by that ultimate sentiment of Awe which the unprecedented visual effects and the amazing direction make not only the screen but also everything above under and all around him over flooded with OK there is not much of a story like the ones we usually watch on screen Gravity looks more like a real time report of an incident that takes place within the 90 minutes the film lasts But it s exactly this supposing real time coverage of a potentially realistic event that makes the difference and through the superb way of telling the story brings the audience within the core of something nobody has ever experienced before in a movie theater Anyway no matter what some narrow hearted may say Gravity belongs to that kind of sublime films which make one think And now what is still to see in a movie theater what may come next worth watching Are movies a finished story for me after this one Well this is its only negative point if you want to see it this way But try to be positive Try not to be mean and open your hearts for what is yet to come Hopefully Gravity is only a short stop and cinema will soon amaze us even more with another extra ordinary movie like this one,10
7 June 2014,Idiots these days are easy to please,This the worst tripe I have ever seen nominated for an Academy Award I would say it takes the Guinness World Book Of Records on that one followed closely by AVATAR Bullock looks like her typical lugubrious self albeit in a space suit for 90 minutes Kim Kardashian could have played this part better as any moron could have been cast in this role I saw only bits and pieces of this movie and immediately knew I would NEVER watch such hogwash even if I was so bored I only had the pastime of laundering my socks It is totally implausible and BORING What this movie proves more than anything else is that it sure doesn t take much to amuse the younger generation these days,1
22 January 2014,"Gravity in a Word: ""Captivating""",Gravity is the latest in science fiction feature films a thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar n that will have your heart racing and your breath held for most of the film Gravity toys with your emotions from minute one juxtaposing the beauty and serenity of space with its impending danger and destruction The film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and tells the story of two astronauts and their fight to get back to Earth after the destruction of their space shuttle Bullock plays the role of Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer on her first expedition to space with Matt Kowalski played by Clooney a veteran and the more experienced of the two Bullock s acting is wonderful as she shared strong and true emotions with the audience despite the fact that for most of the film she only has herself or Matt a man her character isn t very well acquainted with to talk to What set this film apart are the special effects With a budget of 100 million about 80 per cent of the production was done in CG more than James Cameron s Avatar to create a visually stunning film Viewing the beauty of Planet Earth from space is what captivates you for most of the film with the help of 3D technology designed and added in post production under the supervision of Chris Parks giving an amazing depth to the film The work producers put into bringing space to life is phenomenal not to mention the light box with over 4 000 LED bulbs that had to be created invented even to film the actors faces inside their astronaut helmets Gravity shares similarities with traditional tales of determination to return home and survival The Odyssey and Castaway come to mind But in space this narrative takes on a new perspective The theme of perseverance is written all over this movie with Stone questioning her ability to keep fighting to look death in the face and either go on or give up This is a story about going against all odds when the entire universe is against you There are several hints of a rebirth theme as well with the astronauts hanging from the space shuttle with their lifelines like fetuses with their umbilical cords Look out for the scene partway through the film with Bullock floating in a C shape fetal position and remember the way astronauts have to relearn to walk and gain strength in their muscles upon returning to Earth like a child All these instances suggest a Kubrick like interest in demonstrating the evolution and vulnerability of human life united with the scenes of confronting death Gravity is at the top of the list where the Oscars are concerned with ten nominations tied for the lead with American Hustle including a nomination for Best Picture Even astronaut Buzz Aldrin gave the film positive reviews and he told the Hollywood Reporter that he s happy Gravity was made and hopes it will stimulate the public to encourage advancements in space technology I think with a movie like this and all the recent press from Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield we re taking one small step in the right direction http juliekinnear com blogs gravity movie captivating,8
11 January 2019,"That's what I call Entertainment! Yes, with a big E.",What will never cease to amaze me is the amount of people that have no sense for quality How on earth can you score this movie with the lowest rating possible That s just being unfair The lowest rating possible means this is one of the worst movies you ever saw in your miserable life Really You never saw worse than Gravity I thought Alfonso Cuar n did an amazing job and that for a story with basically only two actors and for the most part just one Sandra Bullock and George Clooney made me sit on the edge of my seat more than once in this movie I honestly don t care if it is realistic or not it s most probably not I just wanted to be entertained and that s exactly what I got entertainment Visually it s just perfect as the CGI s make you feel like you re in space yourself The soundtrack brings a special atmosphere to the movie so that was also good Am I surprised Gravity won seven Oscars Absolutely not Gravity deserves all their Oscars as this movie is one of the best of 2013 I wished I watched in the theater though that must have been impressive It was already stunning on my big screen television so I can only imagine the sensation watching it in a theater,9
26 August 2014,Overrated and an embarrassment,Let s start with why it s overrated The plot is boring Yes boring A space action movie that s boring with is an accomplishment kind of This is happening a lot with Hollywood where writers are paid a thousand bucks to write a script and a billion dollars on special effects Compare and contrast to the tense and gripping scifi film Moon Or Dark Star But if those aren t mainstream enough consider Planet of the Apes original made on a shoestring budget You can make a great scifi film without a lot of money Next the acting Big stars in big empty roles Their pedigrees actually made me ask why the film is so boring Like the astronauts they gasped for air to be interesting in stereotypical roles and failed Consider great scifi movies with nameless talent at the time Mark Hamill Harrison Ford and a villain you never even get to see his face and robots Next the embarrassment part The India mars mission cost less than the film something they are proud of The USA space program had a greater day and now Hollywood spends similar money to make sub par films that used to put men on the moon Shameful Disgusting Finally I suppose the biggest problem with the film is that the space station itself is boring much like a bus station in space Aging Soviet rockets take astronauts and cosmonauts to 70 s era style cans to monitor experiments and then back down to Earth Nothing groundbreaking When was the last time you watched space station footage with excitement Since the real thing is boring how to make an improbable real life scenario interesting Lifeforce space sex vampires on the space shuttle was more fun for the love of God I m glad Sandra Bullock wasn t cast in that leading role Hmm perhaps something more fun would be a MURDER in space Perhaps someone dies on the station while everyone is asleep and they try to solve the mystery on the ground That crazy diaper wearing astronaut could be the inspiration Hmmm I should write that up and register it as a screenplay,2
11 October 2013,Jaw-droppingly Spectacular; It's One Hell of a Ride!,Jaw droppingly spectacular it s one hell of a ride Alfonso Cuaron already a well appreciated Director of artistic genius takes us on this incredible journey with Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home towards Gravity The harrowing situation itself is stupefying the stunning visuals the incredible acting and the powerful background score just add to the horror In this era of 3D movies this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect as well as the gripping reality of the film For most of us this is the closest we can ever get to be in space it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts The acting by the lead Sandra Bullock is commendable the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic She single handedly caries the movie on her shoulders The well timed bouts of humour by George Clooney s supporting character the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around Mera jootha hai Japani in space was hilarious as well Other than being an adventurous suspense thriller the slow character development helps us to form an emotional bond as well So by the time the movie reaches climax you re in it as much as the heroic lead Dr Ryan Stone The mesmerizingly orchestrated meteoric shower like scene of the entering spacecraft towards the end of the movie is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history Whether you re a fan of science fiction thrillers or not whether you re a fan of 3D films or not to quote the lead characters from the movie either way it s gonna be one hell of a ride,8

1 March 2014,GRAVITY Soars,Some films Castaway 127 Hours have a simple premise a basic tale of survival devoid of large casts and complicated plot lines Co written with his son Jon s Cuar n director and co writer Alfonso Cuar n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Y Tu Mam Tambi n has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular tension filled adventure Gravity American astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances As hope fades and oxygen running low the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive Caur n successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments Even director James Cameron Avatar who was consulted early on championed the film s ambitions for space realism that was years in the making A ground breaking achievement in visual effects not since Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity Great care and research obviously went into the production The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb like position which acts as a metaphor of life Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects When did any 3D film show a person s tears This one does The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films Cuar n establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harm s way and then to go home to earth The one film this reminds you of is Marooned This is Bullock s The Blind Side show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat she is in virtually every shot We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life Paradoxically space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now It s about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy You will never guess who voices mission control but here s a hint see Apollo 13 Sure despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace And it runs a lean 90 minutes How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity,10
27 June 2015,Beyond Extraordinary,Films like Blackhawk Down attempt through the art of the film maker to bring the viewer into the experience of something that is planned a certain way yet goes horribly wrong That said what this extraordinary piece of film art has in common with Blackhawk Down and most other films of that genre is pretty much nothing Because in Gravity the writer director started with the same theme something planned that goes horribly wrong and transformed transfigured morphed it into a story that defines the very best aspects of what it is to be human to be alive I have done a fair number of reviews for IMDb but I confess I am humbled by this one The technicals Sound direction settings special effects editing Perfect Better than I have ever seen You know you are looking at someone s idea of what it is to be in deep space and the cynic in you keeps trying to find flaws stunts that do not work But there are none to be found Perfect Now the acting Perfect again Bullock has never given a better performance in her career and no disrespect may never surpass this one There is a throwaway line late in the film what used to be called an aside in stage plays which reads in the script I hate space It is tribute to her work here that she not only nails the line but after you leave the theatre or close the DVD you cannot imagine any other actor doing that line and making it work as well Clooney During the run of the original CSI VEGAS the producers were embarrassed by surveys showing that Grissom was the boss most Americans wanted to work for regardless of their job or where they lived After watching this film and even though he has minimal screen time AND ONLY A FEW MOMENTS OF FACE TIME George Clooney is like the only person you would want to call if you were in a dangerous situation and needed counselling That s how good he is And just when you think this perfect film could not get any better you get an ending that makes you cry laugh and wince all at the same time Extraordinary,10
1 January 2022,Visually stunning crap,If you like hours of CGI masquerading as NASA footage then this is the movie for you It is a gorgeous feast for the eyes However the plot is ridiculously thin and I was so tired of Sandra Bullock s whining that I wanted her to die the minute Clooney left the spaceship Movies like this are one more nail in the coffin of awards shows that claim to recognize superior film making but really reward famous actresses and trending topics Awful,4
28 October 2013,Deceived by IMDb--utter CRAP,I convinced my husband to go see this movie solely based on the astoundingly high rating on IMDb com currently 8 6 even though it looked absolutely pathetic in previews I laughed when I read the spoiler disclaimer there is no plot in this movie to spoil Seriously I couldn t tell you what the point of this stupid film was What most angers me is that it has this collective 8 6 rating on IMDb com and we would NEVER have wasted time and money if it weren t for this site which we trusted prior to this I don t know who paid and how much they paid or what favors they called in maybe they have incriminating evidence against someone high up in the company to get this film rated this high I can t imagine anyone giving this film higher than a 5 and that would be just because they are fans of Clooney and or Bullock SHAME ON IMDb and or anyone involved in perpetuating these false reviews ratings In comparison these are the ratings of other space movies that are far and away better than Gravity 2001 A Space Odyssey 8 3 Apollo 13 7 5 The Right Stuff 7 9 Moon 7 9 Sunshine 7 2 Solaris 1972 8 0 Alien Aliens 8 5 Armageddon 6 4 not arguing the rating just that it is WAAAAAYYYY better than Gravity and lastly Gravity is currently ranking about the same or better than all of the Star Wars Star Trek movies SERIOUSLY By the end of the movie I wanted to beat myself for a not trusting my instincts b sitting through one of the all time worst movies I ve ever seen prior to this that honor was held by The Amazing Panda Adventure c spending precious dollars even one for this crap and d dragging my good sport of a husband who isn t a fan of space sci fi films to this show and wasting precious marriage capital Sandra Bullock must be dragging the bottom of the barrel She already starred in two movies this year so awful ridiculous and denigrating to anyone with even a shred of talent that I can t believe she went for a third this bad There was absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie other than a few good special effects but not even enough of those to warrant a mention,1
8 October 2013,I was duped into watching this movie.,I haven t gone to the theater to watch a movie in over a year and this movie just confirms why I don t go anymore Three words describe this movie Disappointing Overrated and Unimpressive What a joke Don t waste your time Stay home and save your money I honestly believed this would be a good movie The reviews the critics the actors the cinematography everything suggested a blockBUSTer but unfortunately it was a total BUST I was bored out of my mind Some of the dialogue was so cheesy I was squirming in my seat and looking around to make sure no one saw me How could anyone give this a raving review Please I get the feeling that the buildup to this movie is just as fixed as the stock market,1
27 December 2019,Watch it again,If you gave this a low review watch it again this is a beautiful film It s not so much a space film or an adventure film or a survival film as much as it is a film about what it means to be human what it means to be alone and the human need for interactions with other humans It s a movie about strength and resilience,10
9 March 2014,What the actual ...,I saw this movie when it first came out and it was so awful that i didn t bother writing a review But when i heard gravity got 7 Oscar nominations i was so furious I honestly don t know whats wrong with the critics The movie was already doomed from the start I was bored out of my mind only 15 minutes after the movie started For those of you who have not seen the movie it is basically a story of a woman trapped in space trying to find her way back to earth The problem with this movie is not the story line but how it was executed It is extremely boring and awful because the story wasn t going anywhere it was too long the acting was poor there was only one setting Sandra bullock faced way too many problems and there was no chemistry what so ever between the only two characters in the entire movie I was surprised because Clooney and bullock were supposed to be great actors but i don t know Frankly i won t advice anyone to go see this movie if they don t want to regret wasting their time,1
22 February 2018,"No, no, no.",Gave it another shot on FXM 19 minutes in I have said no nope no no Satellite colliding into satellite colliding into satellite etc I don t think they actually get anything right More ludicrous than the friend zone guy getting the girl in any every rom com,1
4 October 2013,What an utterly worthwhile experience this is,Like me you ve probably pondered whether the planet might be better off without us humans And maybe it would but Sandra Bullock and director Alfonso Cuaron make a pretty good case for our having some redeeming qualities despite our usually reckless behavior Early on in this movie I began to realize that there s no one I d rather spacewalk with than Ms Bullock if only in 3 D IMAX We re meant to care what happens to the lead engineer Ryan Stone and the movie focuses on and depends on that performance I personally am convinced no other actress could have pulled this off like the endearing Ms Bullock and I d be very surprised if she wasn t nominated for an Academy Award This movie is a wonderful old style science fiction movie where ordinary dreamers like you and I get a chance to muse about the reality of being in space I remember as a kid thinking up pretty much the same sort of not so simple adventure as here though not nearly in such detail That our guides are Ms Bullock and Mr Clooney is just icing on the cake The earth looms below us throughout and it s made very clear how fragile life becomes away from it Everything is about oxygen electronics and the ship its fuel and its structural integrity And one thing more the daunting dynamics of moving in space play a very large and effective role here Don t expect everything to be rock solid logical there s at least one liberty taken just enjoy the trip and you ll be very well rewarded Any flaws amount to nothing compared to the soaring achievement of the movie itself as an unforgettable entertainment For once it s unlikely you ll feel cheated being charged extra for either the IMAX or the 3 D though I suspect those who see this movie without them will still feel quite well satisfied,9
8 October 2013,It is what it is,This is a special effects vehicle nothing more nothing less It follows the formula of every Hollywood action movie You ve got your trauma of seeing people killed then 10 minutes later talking calmly about the old days You ve got your forced homage to a classic movie the 2001 fetal position thing You have your liberties taken with physics and proportion And of course every situation is taken to the extreme they just make it to safety before or someone grabs something or pushes something just before If you re down and want to escape life for a couple hours knock your socks off If you re a relatively happy person with at least marginal intelligence I d wait for it to come out on Netflix,5
12 July 2014,Can't believe anything,Finally saw this thing Thank goodness it was only 91min and I had fast forward All the hype Positively disgusting Maybe it s in part that I do not usually like a Sci Fi anyway but nothing about this movie made me want to continue watching it But I did How did Clooney and Bullock get so caught up in this thing Speaking of which The Thing now that was an intriguing and entertaining Sci Fi back in its day I m referring to the original I was mostly disappointed by Bullock Her expressions and reactions seemed lifeless and unrealistic to what was happening And they start out the movie stating how in space you hear nothing and all through the movie there was this annoying sound track I just didn t get it So they need some music But there were many segments where silence would have been so much more effective and less annoying That s about 86 minutes I will never get back No I didn t watch the credits either All that hype I am rarely compelled to consider writing a review I like most movies I ve seen Some I see multiple times or buy the DVD This one just irritated me with all the phoney antics Bullock herself was the main flaw Special effects did not impress me either All in all a real disappointment Updated Aug 2014 I recently saw Contact on Encore I had never seen it because I m not drawn to Sci Fi and Jodie Foster tired me Not a fan Well I was wrong This movie was really good And I thought it the best I ve ever seen Jodie Foster She was brilliant Gravity What a hoax,1
16 December 2013,Terrible acting and epic fail,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,1
4 October 2013,"Good, but let's not say it's completely realistic...",The visuals for this movie are impressive The story line is enjoyable and it leaves you appreciating your place on Earth The characters also provide some good laughs It was one of the better space movies However as a geek I know I know it s a movie the orbits are all wrong for some of the events to even remotely take place So if you know anything about space travel as usual suspend disbelief for the moment It at least stayed largely true to the no sounds in space thing and provides some good lessons about linear and angular momentum The fact I even get to bring this up means I give the film makers some serious props I wouldn t go so far as some of the reviews where they says the movie is creating a whole new genre The reviewers and movie makers just never realized until now what us geeks knew all along space is much more awesome and frightening if you portray it more realistically Hopefully the movie also provides a good reminder about how special this little rock is and how unforgivable the rest of the universe is Let s try and keep our planet that way At least I was reminded of this when I left the theater,7
6 October 2013,Wonderfully Visual Event But Not Really A Complete Movie.,I really do hesitate to call this a film or movie because there really is no story here It s an event put to film but there is no heart or plot at all It s a wonderfully visual hypnotic and captivating event in orbit Do spectacular visuals trump the lack of character development and an actual story Maybe in this case it does I enjoyed it but all this hype and praise seem like trumped up bandwagon stuff to me This movie is gaining great praise so the week willed among film fans want to attach their movie wagon to a critical winner Again I give this a big thumbs up as a visual and captivating event but it s not a true movie by definition It s an IMAX nature event with fictional death and destruction mixed in,
3 December 2013,A film with no redeeming qualities,This is where I get really annoyed that there is no possibility of giving a film zero I am also pre warned about not adding spoilers How could I possible say anything that would spoil this film Visuals mwah Acting The pits Storyline As one reviewer said could be written on the back of a cigarette packet and he LIKED the film Plus it s totally unbelievable Dialogues Corny as corny can be Characters 1D Meaning To make money for the producers,1
29 November 2018,Scarier than most horror movies,This film had me on the edge of my seat almost all the way through The special effect are astounding and the story is gripping I honestly don t see the hate this film gets,10
15 November 2013,Not even a B movie.,We know that marketing can sell products that are less than good but how trailers reviews and previews have managed to convince so many people that this is a great movie is beyond my comprehension This movie is dire The story is weak unengaging and unbelievable The characters evoke no pathos and empathy in the viewer resulting in an experience that is woefully dissatisfying Sandra Bullock supposedly a trained astronaut begins by complaining about feeling nauseous in space and rapidly moves to ongoing pleas for help as she is thrown around in space Whilst this would probably be a frightful experience George Clooney fortunately manages to stay calm and gradually secure some kind of rescue for the distressed damsel He should have thought of himself OK so we have impressive 3D visuals but after 10 minutes of extreme depth of field anyone whose thoughts are drifting from the less than riveting storyline is likely to begin contemplating how 3D movies don t actually simulate how our vision works We are selective in what we focus on and 3D films offer us visual information that is frequently irrelevant Save the entrance fee and cost of the spectacles and go see a good story told well e g Blue Jasmine Gravity isn t even a B movie,1
15 November 2013,A Masterclass,This review will contain spoilers and I really mean it Not many new films get me pumped up at least not as many as I would like The last time I was this eager to go to the cinema was a few years back when I was able to see B la Tarr s A torin i l 2011 and Terrence Malick s The Tree of Life 2011 both on the same day actually Before that perhaps David Lynch s Inland Empire 2006 I had read about Cuar n s ambitions and considering Children of Men 2006 is just as masterly as they say and wrestles with just the kind of filmic issues I m fond of space length of sequences movement of camera why wouldn t I have been over the moon to see this But really After this first sequence of 17 minutes I was sold and they could have done anything and I mean anything after that and I still would have had the time of my life I have seen quite a few 3D films and never felt its use was cinematically necessary but here it s more than justified it s integral The movement of the camera is gut wrenching at times and the sense of space is achieved through the use of 3D not through gimmicks that emphasize the technology but through subtlety often emphasizing the naturalness of the environment I have a list of the most uplifting and lucid film moments and that sequence has its place there Not that the film goes downhill after that On the contrary it s a cinematic masterclass in entertaining and cinematically profound filmmaking condensed in 90 minutes The camera soars in space becoming a third character We become weightless In contrast when we finally arrive to Earth the camera stays down on the ground only able to glance upward unable to rise and soar as it did because of gravity Is there a film where something so naturally mundane to us as gravity is lifted up from its everyday context and given fresh relevance I think this makes a fine companion to Al Reinert s For All Mankind 1989 a profound study of space our insignificant yet beautifully meaningful part in this vast universe the importance of achieving space travel becoming acquainted with an unknown and thus fearsome yet grand and immensely breathtaking world the feeling one might have when gazing upon the Earth as we gaze upon the moon from our planet But space has no feelings for us If we think of space in terms of its dangers we often describe it as hostile But it is not hostile nor is it friendly Space simply is And that sense of loneliness and terror in helplessness is also grandly present in these films as it should be Of those of us who have ever thought about space and what it might feel like to be there who hasn t also thought of how it might feel like when one is adrift alone facing the infinite seeming blackness with no hope of return,9
7 December 2013,"Surprising they made it into space, since the movie doesn't take off",Let s get one thing clear 3D and special effects don t do it for me OK it s nice technology but they don t make a movie I look for a story for actors who can convey emotions Gravity had almost nothing of that A far fetched script Sandra Bullcok hyperventilating and panicking continuously George Clooney being ridiculously cool and relaxed what a waste of the talent of two good actors And the clich s a ping pong paddle floating in the Chinese space station vodka on the Russian station This reminded me of the disaster movies that came out during the 70s and 80s thank goodness those have been forgotten since I was hoping that an intelligent movie could come out of Hollywood not this time,4
8 March 2014,If this deserves 7 Oscars the Oscars lost their weight,I am going to make this a quick one because it s not even worth my time Normally i do reviews from films that are underrated This film obvious is the opposite No story Barely dialog Dumb acting from Clooney And because it s just Clooney and Bullock the only thing i liked a bit was her acting but that couldn t made up for this horror of a movie Without the end title screen the film lasts 80 minutes The first five looked like space odyssey 2001 In comparison to time 70 minutes there was something going on But no story I really ask myself how many turds vote this film above average And are some involved in the film industry Since Nespresso Clooney got drunk This film as an abomination There was no script i think Just some guys having some cool CGI and took some disaster orbit shots of debris NO STORY AT ALL Man i miss Battlestar Galactica 2003 This film got 7 Oscars and i really wonder for what Only some CGI looked cool The rest of the film is very bad And so not believeble First time I say this on IMDb but this was not worth the time i spend on it Make up your own mind but my advise stay away from this flick Its a waste of time,1
5 October 2013,"A technical wonder, a visual stunner",James Cameron has called Alfonso Cuaron s GRAVITY the greatest space film ever made I want to believe he means after 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY although that should be a given right Nonetheless Cuaron s follow up to his brilliant CHILDREN OF MEN 2006 is another landmark in the sci fi genre The premise is simple but the execution is what makes it a work of art Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a biomedical engineer from Illinois and astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney must find a way to survive after an accident leaves them lost in space The universal themes of survival and resistance in space give room for Cuaron and his troupe to create some of the most beautiful visual effects you ll ever see As of 10 04 2013 I have seen only 3 films that have used 3D technology to really complement storytelling Wim Wenders PINA 2011 Martin Scorsese s HUGO 2011 and GRAVITY However even though GRAVITY is just as impressive technically as the aforementioned titles it is my least favorite of the three because of its lead actors Clooney is just being Clooney and although this is the best Bullock has ever been that hardly means much to me as I think she s a very bland actress That soulless stare remains there and I can t help but wonder what someone like Jessica Chastain could have done with this role In Sandra s defense I can also say she doesn t compromise the overall quality of the film too much but she is my major complain about it there s even an obvious Oscar scene written just for her GRAVITY may just fall short of masterpiece level but it s still a fascinating film for its technical achievements If the Academy does not recognize the work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki this time they never will Go see it in 3D as it s supposed to be seen and enjoy the ride,
6 February 2016,Gravity as symbolic of new era,Gravity Gravity is in fact a beautiful film What to add if not to write about the special effects the characters or the plot And what about the symbolic aspects of the film which makes it a desirable film to talk and write about An aspect neglected when talking about the film The acute use of symbolism starts at the moment after the first catastrophe when George Cloney breaks away from Sandra Bullock in order for her to survive She enters the Russian Spacelab and takes off her astronaut outfit After taking off the outfit she swings her arms upwards to see her body in full extension to a point that before she reaches a foetal form her extended body shows her legs as if they had become some sort of a mermaid tale It might seem far fetched yet I would advise to take a close look at that scene again The she attains the foetal form where one cable looks like the umbilical cord then we are afterwards launched through a narrow corridor which could be the uterus From that scene on up until her reaching and landing on planet earth it will be her growing up experience as the tight tunnel in the Spacelab could be a representation of her coming out of the uterus But where would this all lead up to The only flaw I see in regards to the symbolism and that is and we could ask a question at what moment does the shift from our reality that of a space catastrophe which has been the fault of the Russians and their missile launch on American satellites to bring us to a new dimension as we will discover it at the end The only moment I see is when inside the Spacelab George Cloney comes back then she wakes up alone I believe the Twilight Zone effect starts at this point where the fantasy kicks in to bring to a deeper level of thinking and plot development Our reality has disappeared for a new one How can all of this be linked Near the end of the film when she crashes in a lake somewhere which could be China since she used the Chinese Spacelab it is to ask if there are still people on earth Now the capsule is flooding with water and like a mother s womb full of water she reaches the surface like a baby getting out of the womb As we are shown we see only her head out of the water a solitary background and she reaches shore dragging her way out like the first amphibian that populated the earth before the dinosaur era And more interesting it makes the link to the foetal form in the Russian Spacelab and the mermaid effect with difficulty she succeeds in standing up The camera angle filming her legs is for one reason To show the new era of humans that will originate from her and the male she will seek since she could be viewed as Eve and her future mate Adam the background almost representing the Garden of Eden What then is special about her legs When one observes the camera angle her left leg is in full view showing her muscled side which demonstrates human training and exercises However the right leg which is further back shows a skinny leg which resembles that of an alien leg feature skinny In other words the new era of humans would be half human and half alien due to her prolonged stay in space and experiences In all I would say that a film of this nature is very rare and more should be made I rate this film 9 out of 10,
19 December 2013,AWFUL - One of the worst films made in the last 30 years,I am so angry tat like this gets made and that so many people like it Bad acting BAD script BAD BAD BAD Its called GRAVITY so maybe learn how it works and not just make it up for a film Bullocks character would never have been given that job Clooney is my least favorite actor ever and this has made me loathe him more What SPECTACULAR miscasting I also thank the makers for adding to an onslaught of SPACE movies in the next few years How many years training does it take to press any old buttons and say Eeeny Meeny Minny Mo and read Russian and Chinese One last thing because a film has breathtaking jaw dropping amazing etc etc special effects doesn t mean its good Definitely in my Top Ten Worst ever,1

2 April 2014,Can somebody please explain the hype to me? Please?...,When I first read about this movie I laughed Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in space A barely existent plot I decided that I wanted to check it out as a movie fan I wanted to at least see how bad I thought it would be The movie was slightly better than I expected mainly the elements of tension it occasionally stirred up but the flaws were overwhelming I cannot see how people can praise this film There are so many problems And I ll forget the endless plot holes because one could dedicate an essay to that subject alone The camera work was at times busy but a lot seemed random and seemed to only occur during a bad event as if to emphasize the suspense due to the lack of any meaningful dialogue or acting just Sandra Bullock comfortably floating through a space station that is being ripped apart by shrapnel in her underwear no apparent fear for what could happen Her acting is just there The character development is ridiculous as it is a dream that essentially turns Bullock from timid to heroic When the crap started hitting the fan the CGI looked okay but it didn t look real The problem was that it was supposed to look real I m not sure what planet they were orbiting either but it doesn t look like any Earth I have seen a picture of Perhaps I was hallucinating Not much else can be said There are only two characters and Clooney makes Bullock look amateur by turning himself into the macho and arrogant but with a soft heart lieutenant without even trying Compare this to say his performance in BURN AFTER READING He was just going through the motions And for someone lost in space Bullock was amazingly bland The silly story and script didn t help her either Sh t Sh t Ugh this damn thing Ugh I hate space Amazingly horrid dialogue juvenile and extremely typical of Hollywood This movie was quite clearly a pretty looking cash grab and nothing more and it paid off if you take any notice of what The Awards Season recognises that is 3 10 is being generous but it was better than I went in expecting So there s that,3
16 February 2015,"Visually outstanding, underwhelming in every other regard",This movie is one of the most overpraised of its time Admittedly there are some outstanding visual effects which are very stimulating to watch but that s a necessity for this movie given that it fails to engage on any other level The script is minimalist and unimaginative the acting is average I don t rate Sandra Bullock as an actress anyway and the story is stretched out well beyond the length it should have been I honestly cannot comprehend what has so many critics raving about this film because there s nothing outstanding about it whatsoever When I saw the trailer I thought it was going to be for a short film and after seeing the movie all the way through now I strongly believe that my initial impression was dead on This should never have been a movie but it would have made for a reasonable short film,4

20 November 2013,Gravity is all cinema should be.,Gravity is all cinema should be Perilous contradictory cathartic insightful It s a film about everyone and a film about just one person It results in a film that s at once the biggest scale film possible and incredibly intimate and personal This is a rare event to be treasured After one of my all time favourite films Children of Men the brilliant sensual Y Tu Mama Tambien and the best of the Harry Potter films Prisoner of Azkaban it was quite clear that Alfonso Cuaron is a talented director who will stand the test of time Which meant he was free to take his time as it seemed like we were waiting forever for Gravity coming 7 years after we last saw him I read the script while it was still playing the festival circuit and even on paper it was compelling moving and unpredictable Even though I knew what happens I couldn t have been more excited and the hype was the highest it s been for a film in a long time And what a total full body full soul roller coaster it was Like the rest of the world I had tears in my eyes the whole time with my jaw dropped in awe and my breathing in sync with its protagonist It captures the human condition in all its physical and meta physicality Needless to say about its true star this is most likely the best visual effects there s ever been It seems every year we re going to get a special effects laden blockbuster from an auteur that innovates the technology gathers all the technical Oscars and attempts to use it to its full artistic potential Sometimes that potential is limited with Martin Scorsese s Hugo and James Cameron s Avatar disappointing Sometimes that potential is pretty good with Ang Lee s Life Of Pi and Christopher Nolan s Inception satisfying enough But it s never been quite as extraordinary as Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity Combined with the careful and stunning use of sound design and Emmanuel Lubezki s thrilling and intelligent cinematography its conviction provides a convincing and heart pounding experience It has ideal pacing as it stays suspenseful yet is able to breathe There s a priceless excitement and cinematic magic with excessively unbroken shots that films of all genres indulge in but Gravity takes it to another level in its shots that last over 15 minutes Sure there was undoubtedly extensive post production work involved to stitch shots together but that work was meticulous that you can t help but get swept away in the illusion In the IMAX saw a trailer for the next Hobbit film beforehand and I immediately regretted what I had gotten myself into 3D just doesn t seem ready to do justice to its name I only ever enjoyed it once and that was Toy Story 3 where the filmmakers had control of all the layers However Gravity may be the first live action 3D film I ve seen to actually make it work Life Of Pi may have deserved some of its acclaim but it only worked in certain shots That s because not all the layers were designed for 3D Gravity has the benefit of having very few layers often it was only astronaut and or space station Earth background resulting in more control and less to get in the way In the script the distances between things were often miles apart but with nothing to obstruct the view 3D enhances that sense of scale and makes it immersive and utterly visceral Even now life still feels so small scale in comparison Despite its limitations of plot and character it s extremely rewarding that Gravity is a film where every viewer takes something different and valuable away from it Whether it be about a woman s plight with gravity the human instinct of perseverance or simply having a story to tell The idea that stuck with me most is the acceptance of death If not now if not in an hour then anytime in the future It s something that has always motivated art and Gravity hits the spot While it is thanks to the depth of the writing in such an action packed film reading the script didn t have the same effect It s due to Sandra Bullock s committed performance There s a lot to admire in Bullock and George Clooney s performances The way Gravity was shot required them to repeat actions to the milli meter For them to still incorporate soul into their characters with such restrictions requires genuine talent and although I skipped The Blind Side I definitely believe in Bullock That said Clooney is getting a lot of the complaints in that he s irritatingly just being Clooney While I feel I can defend that in the level of precision required in every take that the fact he does just do Clooney is a feat in itself the film does suffer from its Hollywood cheese charm dialogue It does add an essential flavour in the otherwise sparse film but its timing is the problem and often it feels inappropriate Unfortunately that Americanised appeal added to the film also damages the score that too often feels invasive and manipulative It s a great score but it needed to be dialled down a few notches for a more subtle and graceful effect Regardless of these minor inconsistencies Gravity is an instant iconic film for the ages It may be another special effect heavy film that will most likely play second fiddle to something more to the Academy s taste assuming the predicted 12 Years A Slave Gravity love split stays strong til Oscar night but this time it s a completely worthy one Even detractors have to admit in many ways Gravity is simply astonishing However the concern is how will it fare on DVD Is this exclusively a 3D IMAX experience We ll have to wait a few months to find out but I urge anyone to witness it in that way rather than tablets and phones Now I m going to find an even bigger screen to watch it again 9 10,9
12 December 2013,Gravity: an Astounding Space Adventure,Where to start from Let s see I think I found it Alfonso Cuaron is a great director and an even greater writer The movie he put together is amazing and catching and delicious Is about being in the space loose your own weight and your more rooted habits Shows how beautiful is the human body Sandra Bullock rotating out of her space suit how beautiful is the earth and how beautiful human beings can be George Clooney never losing his good mood The last scene explaining what gravity means for us all is worth an Academy Award for the best finale if ever there will be one I am aware of all the criticism raised by others there are already more than 1 100 reviews while I m writing my note about Physics laws not always completely respected but being a nerd myself I can assure you that this will not bother you not even for a moment unless you as a kid were bothered when Jules Verne made you travel to the Center of the Earth and return on a brazier coming out from the Vesuvius Your eyes will be delighted and You will feel very privileged to be orbiting the earth live the International Space Station as it were your own place taste the oxygen blended with excessive CO2 and feel the desperate need for mother planet we all have,10

16 October 2013,DO NOT Waste Time or Money Seeing This - FALSELY Rated Film,To say I feel disgusted and ripped off by this film is an understatement I watch a LOT of movies and this is just an outright terrible film I saw it in 3D which added nothing to the movie experience and to be honest was a complete waste of time and money and there were few scenes if any that merited 3D at all However my greatest contempt is for this website itself IMDb who have either actively been involved or deliberately allowed a false rating to be contrived and displayed on this website to dupe people into seeing it Either the film studio has paid people to write and give falsely great reviews films above 8 0 are rare or IMDb have taken money to deceive people like myself into seeing this film with its artificially created high rating Whether I like a film or not it is irrelevant because I can always find reasons why others would disagree with me but this film had nothing at all to offer To summarize it was a very weak story line with rather unbelievable lines as to how anyone could have survived and little or no special effects making me for only the third time in my life want to ask for my money back but this film definitely was my highest rated rip off film of all time as I was conned by this site into seeing it because of its false 8 7 rating I feel so strongly that I may even sue the film studio for misrepresentation as I was definitely not entertained in any shape or form by this film an very much doubt I shall be using this site in future unless they do something about this rating fixing,1

27 February 2014,An embarrassment,This is not a spoiler There is nothing to spoil I have rarely given a film such a low score and I am one who enjoys the subject of space travel and good sci fi I am shaken that any part of this film was nominated for an Oscar I am disappointed at the high score of readers on IMDb in my mind it creates a cloud on all future high ratings By any measure except special effects even those are not that spectacular this film is a failure If you enjoy watching things fly around and Sandra Bullock grunt and gasp for an hour and a half by all means watch it Dialogue what little there is is insipid Plot is preposterous I can only imagine NASA workers laughing and rolling their eyes Anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking take my advice Don t waste 90 minutes of your life You can t say you weren t warned,1
9 March 2014,space junk alludes to Earth junk,Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity comes across as a metaphor for our own world The debris that strikes the astronauts isn t that much different from the problems that we see on Earth whether physical pollution or personal stress But in the end we like the astronauts must face the problems directly The movie deserved its Oscar wins for the technical categories and Cuar n s direction It creates a chilling feeling of isolation much like 2001 A Space Odyssey did But the bulk of the praise goes to Sandra Bullock as the embattled medical engineer the character is the perfect balance between terror stricken and persevering in the face of a seemingly insurmountable challenge It s a movie that you have to see to believe I also recommend Cuar n s movies Y Tu Mam Tambi n and Children of Men I haven t seen 12 Years a Slave but it sounds as though that one has a much more important story As for the ones that I ve seen Nebraska and The Wolf of Wall Street are really good,9
23 February 2014,A story of survival,By definition Gravity is a technical wonder All of the details were meticulously orchestrated by Alfonso Cuaron in a very masterful way Given the incredible work that was put into this part of the film it s quite understandable that the story is a bit overshadowed at least in my estimation It s not a bad story by any means and the fight for survival is always an interesting enough subject to portray in cinema especially when you take into account the complications that our leading star goes through Still it fails to impress when compared to some more complex stories at this year s Oscars As far as other aspects go I must say that Sandra Bullock handles her role very well as she brings a lot of intensity throughout the entire 90 minutes of the movie Much like Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave although in different circumstances Bullock is the central focus of the movie and therefore must be very convincing There are mostly two aspects that I d like to highlight in the movie The first is the amazing job Alfonso Cuaron did directing the film You could really tell this was a passion project and the end result was something quite outstanding On the other hand though one can t be a little turned off by the simplistic story of survival in outer space one that while well constructed ultimately fails to capture the dark yet beautiful magic of the world that is Gravity Rating 8 10,8

22 May 2014,"Great special effects, skimpy script/story",I heard great things about this movie but besides the outstanding special effects the script was pretty clich and cringeworthy and there was very little character development We are supposed to feel for Kowalski yet the guy s a cartoon superhero with absolutely no background other than a love of country music stolen from Apollo 13 Bullock s character is inconsistent a scared babbling citizen astronaut to an experienced looking pilot who can read foreign manuals and navigate her way through foreign space stations like she s been there a hundred times In general despite its special effects and a few exciting scenes an ultimately forgettable and clich d film,5
6 March 2014,"Its a work of fiction, not a documentary!!",I have just watched this in 3D and to be honest i was somewhat blown away The film is visually stunning and the score deserves the Oscar win it walked away with I am not going to launch into some film critic diatribe on the scientific plausibility of the whole film as IT IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY Its a film a work of fiction to provide 90 minutes of pure entertainment Suspend your disbelief and just go with it as for most of us its the closest to space we will ever get When i see the reviews that lay into this i fear that we have lost the ability to just enjoy a film for what it is rather than expect some life changing world peace bringing disease curing on screen miracle,10

6 December 2013,Are you freaks joking?,If you have a logical intelligence quote over 75 then you will most likely find this movie to be totally rubbish The movie is almost from start to end filled with things that not in a million light years ever would occur but if such things disturb you then perhaps you can find something good out of this movie but then i ask myself what should that be since nothing else but just that how this movie got 8 5 here is to me a huge mystery I really don t find the characters even close to be somewhat trustworthy either what normal person would trapped in space crack jokes and laugh like they were having a drink on the french coast I want my money back Br Thomas,1

20 March 2016,Liked It,I missed Gravity when it came out and finally caught up on it after having it on my bucket list of movies to see Wow did I miss out on a great one Once again my praise of the movie has as much to do with the amount of awful and clich kinds of movies that continually are made and come out these days that either bore me or are an insult Most are underwhelming and what I would refer to as opportunities missed Gravity doesn t miss It is all it can be and I would highly recommend it The beauty and visuals of the movie are incredible and awe inspiring but I was also surprised that the story acting action and dialogue were also very good After seeing many survival movies where only one or two people battle nature or the elements I had a good measuring stick for what to expect There s Castaway and The Revenant for instance and although both these movies are good the boredom that sets in at times due to having little instances for dialogue with others you do feel In Gravity the key to its never boring take on such a solo survival story is that it s short The movie is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long so there is never a feeling that it drags at all unlike similar movies like the aforementioned Gravity is intense gripping fun to watch emotional and at times sprinkles in some unexpected humor to boot Sandra Bullock is an inspiration This is a must see classic science fiction movie with some of the best cinematography of a space movie ever I was really glad I watched it and finally caught up on what I missed 10 10,10

18 October 2013,"Buy the Hype, Buy a Ticket and Witness Something Truly Remarkable",Gravity 2013 out of 4 Visual masterpiece about an astronaut George Clooney and a medical engineer Sandra Bullock who must try to find a way to survive in space after an accident leaves them cut off from everything GRAVITY does a lot of great things and it also puts to rest the whole notion of not watching movies in a theater Those saying I ll wait for the Blu ray are going to be missing quite the experience because this is a film that was born to be seen on the big screen and in 3D There s really no way that any words can pay justice to the special effects in this film but I guess I d say that watching this movie is the closest most people will ever get to experiencing outer space I was really amazed at how wonderful the special effects are as they certainly live up to the hype It seems every month movie goers get more hype about something grand but I think it s safe to say that the effects here are perhaps the greatest that you re ever going to see and not too many movies have used effects to such an advantage I think this entire movie would fall apart if even for a split second you didn t feel as if you were with these characters all alone and in space The idea is terrifying on its own but the way the film turns this into an adventure is something quite amazing to watch It s also rather amazing at how simple but powerful the story is As the short running time moves along we re told bits and pieces about the Bullock character and when everything plays out it s certainly an incredibly touching and emotional ride Given the right material Bullock can be truly great and this here is without question the greatest work of her career She s certainly limited in the movements that the character can do so she must act with her eyes and she does a masterful job Clooney is also very effective bringing his calm and cool nature to the role which so perfectly plays well against the other character who is in a panic I m certainly not going to ruin how things play out but the entire film just leaves you in a state of drama from the opening scene to the closing There s no question that GRAVITY will be remembered for decades to come So if you think waiting around for this is a smart idea buy the hype buy the ticket and witness something truly remarkable,
23 February 2014,The finest science fiction movie since Inception.,Gravity was a flat out amazing experience at the movies that filmgoers will keep talking about for years Everything in this movie was absolutely gorgeous from the visual effects the perfectly planned cinematography and 3D the flawless direction of Alfonso Cuaron the believable script and the unforgettable performance of Sandra Bullock From the moment you see the opening shot of the Explorer Shuttle get closer and closer to the camera in one shot and introducing the main characters of Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney and Ryan Stone performed by Sandra Bullock this shot shows how they see space in their own different ways Gravity is the Citizen Kane of digital cinema There are no problems with this fine film everything in the film has a purpose whether it be beauty in the imagery especially some of the shots of Earth in the film or the terrifying experience of spinning into the starry black abyss of space out of control or the character reveals that play out through a scene If it weren t for Alfonso Cuaron s bold vision of the potential modern cinema can have Gravity may have turned out to be a very different movie Gravity is an honest film in that it knows to use the imagery to full effect and have the visual effects affect the characters not have them be invincible to giant CGI robots or something like massive explosions Alfonso wants the film to be an experience that is full of moments that are awe spiring beautiful unpredictable terrifying and full of impact I thought Gravity was THE film of 2013 a must see that no one should miss Even if you never got to see it at the cinemas in 3D still watch however and whenever you can Gravity gets a platinum 10 10 stars,10
19 October 2013,A Spiritual and Tranquil Ride in Space,Our earth is so stunningly pretty if we step back and look at it from space On this enormous big blue marble we see typhoon sunrise sunset Polar lights mountain ranges and city lights all from a different angle It would have been such a nice ride if not for the accident which causes Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney stranded and roaming in space with limited fuel and oxygen There is absolute silence except her own breathe With loss of gravity even with it now we know human is so fragile Life is so delicate compared to indefinite space Yet the will to live can be so strong and powerful because we have someone we care for and we respect life whether it is a dog woofing a baby crying or a frog swimming Up there in space there is no boundaries no orientation no nationality or even language barrier Whatever you believe in does not matter anymore Whatever we strive or fight for on Earth is not such a big deal anymore Our hung ups should not be bothering us anymore in that absolute space It echoed what an astronaut I interviewed years ago who said when you are up there in the space shuttle you would not think of your national background just found yourself a global citizen or resident of the Earth May we protect and keep our Earth in good shape for future generations to come In that Zen like drift panicking does not help Just be calm take a deep breath and do what you have to do while enjoying the ride What a spiritual ride that urges you to appreciate solitude and being alive Excellent visual effects where we are seamlessly drifting and floating together with them even inside Dr Stone s spacesuit The first 10 minutes were all seamed in one shot while we as the audience are also rolling spinning and flipping gently in space What an elating experience How did they do that This has to be watched in 3D The sound effects music and breathing were also breathtaking which match perfectly with the mood of the spacemen and the edging circumstances No more worry about whatever that is on your mind This will definitely give you a new perspective of looking at life and at ourselves Just go and enjoy the drift,8
19 November 2013,Amazingly manages to keep its audience engrossed for an hour and a half in space,I would love to give gravity top marks I really would It is a genuinely unique movie Set in space for 98 percent of its running time Plus its special effects are amazing and look completely jaw dropping on the big screen It is a great flick I have to say but one that relies on and in some ways NEEDS its 3D effects to get by To me 3D is still a gimmick If you ve seen one 3D movie you ve seen them all If you haven t seen anything in 3D since Avatar then Gravity will be a wonder to behold Unfortianly though i ve seen a lot of 3D crap since Avatar Still the flick amazingly manages to keep its audience engrossed for an hour and a half in space Doing this without having to resort to aliens or big fiery space ship battles Its all about Sandra Bullocks struggle to survive in a realistic Or at least more realistic than usual movie version of space and I ve always had a thing for these one man shows Especially when you find yourself genuinely rooting for this characters survival in a creepy environment where anything can happen So in short it is great But come on 3D isn t still cool is it,9
5 October 2013,Another million dollar bland soup,There s something amazing about Hollywood cinema When you think they were done with pushing the boundaries of cheesiness and plot less explosions somebody raises millions of dollars do to so Except the 10 first minutes that eventually let some hope stay on the screen and some nice 3D images this movie has been a waste of time It looks like a mix of well known a thousand time heard chunks of fast food plot Really A joke Dramatic family pictures dramatic love story know it all veteran the poor mother who realizes she love her daughter hot actress in underwear violin music every 5 minutes let me go no because you will die but its OK but no but aahhh I don t think i can list all these jokes Not worth it Gravity is another million dollar bland soup,2
20 December 2013,Too much cliché and errors,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,3
20 September 2013,"""The best space film ever done"" - James Cameron",Indeed the best space film ever done This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space Incredibly effective long takes throughout the film bring the realism and suspense that none other space film has ever done before The acting is subtle and engaging Sandra Bullock deserves another Oscar after this as well as best director for Alfonso Cuaron and Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki I can t recommend this film enough Ground breaking beautiful and technically perfect Film schools will be studying this film in the future 690 out of 1 372 found this helpful,10

5 May 2014,Couldn't Suspend My Disbelief,The visuals and sound were great but that is not enough to make this overrated movie actually good The plot was so incredibly convenient and unrealistic that it completely took me out of the movie and the repetitive action scenes grow boring quickly The acting is nothing special and it certainly isn t helped by the dialogue The characters are unbelievable and anyone who passed middle school science can tell that some of the physics mainly one of the most important scenes of the movie make no sense Overall Gravity is fun to look at but just isn t a good movie The insane amount of hype for this movie made it all the more disappointing,5

24 May 2020,Astonishing sci-fi adventure,Gravity is an astonishing sci fi adventure that s ridiculously tense and effectively atmospheric George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are both perfect Alfonso Cuar n s direction is incredible and combined with Emmanuel Lubezki as director of photography results in it being beautifully filmed and consistently visually stunning The CG is excellent It s expertly paced and the music by Steven Price is amazing,10
28 April 2014,A Visual Feast and An Insult to Real Astronauts,What this movie is really trying to say Sandra Bullock is very fit for her age George Clooney is so cool in a spacesuit We deserve to win awards because we care about realism in this science fiction We did this and that research and training with real space professionals etc What this movie ended up saying Hollywood has its own idea of scientific realism George Cloony looks old even in a cool spacesuit Oh and there s crazy amount of space junk up there which will one day come back to bite all of us down here All it takes is a meteor or an X flare and a chain reaction When that happens all a space technician could do Panting and spinning uncontrollably in space The disasters on the ground produced by this kind of massive space junk apocalypse event will likely kill more people on the ground Yet we are to focus on one very important haplessly spinning space walker who could barely save her own very fit physique Panting uncontrollably every step of the way and even after being repeatedly told to calm down and to conserve energy consumes already dwindling oxygen supply and shows how untrained ill disciplined and unprofessional the astronaut is and how lazy the writer director actors are Lead character is apparently a certified emotionally unstable and technically mediocre panicky random button pushing astronaut Still given the job What an insult to real astronauts At least 40 something Bullock tried her best to look 35 and succeeded 100 silver hair and nonathletic Clooney looks completely his post menopausal age and by any account should not be in a spacesuit nor strutting about some expensive space station low on insulin supply Another insult to real younger taller fitter than athletes astronauts Which brings us to another possibly unintended effect China looks like the real space master Not sure if that s already true in reality But unlike this realistic Bullock astronaut Chinese astronauts would likely read Russian buttons or at least breathe calmly and take more calculated risk when in doubt China certainly won t send a charming but aging male out there and risk their billion dollar investments And the plot What plot There is no plot to give away Just lots of spinning above glorious earth hyper diligent space station cockpit shots panic damsel panting audio and Bullock s super fit body parts on display Scientifically Gravity is one of the worst insult to real professionals offender of this decade especially given the stellar budget and the we care about realism hype Just admit it is a blatant Bullock star vehicle and stop elevating it to some hard science fiction pedestal And because it is more about making Bullock like able it became less about character realism Apparently female astronaut still needs to pant in damsel in distress style to elicit audience sympathy and to seek daddy figure reassurance just so that she could function coherently A weak minded vulnerable unfocused female leading character is not my idea of female hero but designed to be appealing to the Bullock fan crowd Another annoyance throughout this film for me Still even with all of the above the movie managed to entertain me due to one single factor the setting I just happen to like geographic or space documentary The movie should be called Above Earth Aiming straight at Bullock and Clooney fan club Watchable for non science buffs Will likely annoy hard science fiction fans,6
12 December 2013,"Watch the trailer, there.. you've seen it",Seriously my 4 stars are 2 for acting 2 for special effects Dialog get s more or less 0 because it sounds like it was hashed out in about 10 minutes I d normally save the rest for plot but there was none If you watch the trailer and I tell you that she survives you would then be able to convince anybody else who s seen it that you d seen it too I m sure plenty of people will say that s an exaggeration but I promise it s not If you meet anybody who says it s good try this out for yourself and see if it works The special effects are amazing but it s like the icing on a missing cake you have to have substance first Bear in mind I m a huge fan of movies like inception and the matrix movies which some would accuse of being more special effects than plot but this takes the biscuit I ll say no more because the trailer plus the inevitable ending speaks for itself,4

1 November 2013,A stunning and masterfully directed space drama-thriller.,I would place Gravity up in the echelons of other space films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and Wall E I felt gripped from the start and in my opinion that is one major criteria of excellent cinema It is beautifully rendered The visuals are beyond stunning and the 3D is brilliantly executed So very many films have been utilizing 3D which adds no value to the movie and are completely third rate This film utilizes the extra dimension in the best way possible to give the viewer the best possible experience The beautifully crafted film employs visuals that will leave the viewer stunned mystified and in awe To prevent spoiling the film all i shall say is the visual scenes are grand and brilliant in every way Cinematography at its finest However great visuals only do not a great work of art make The visual thrills are one of the many sensational aspects in the film The directing is spot on masterfully rendered Visionary if i may say so The audience is made to feel part of the experience captured and drawn in as if at that place in time and seeing through the eyes of the characters The intermingling of a great score and tenderly directed scenes that capture every moment every emotion and every tiny speck of humanity making this a triumph A brilliantly thought up story One would think the story line is redundant and overdone Others would question the depth of a story such as this To these people i implore WATCH THE MOVIE A story so simple and yet so intense One which brings together the elements of a great thriller with surprises at every turn and elements of great drama a story that taps into the deepest emotions and into the psyche of these characters dissecting their every thought and action It is a story of hope courage and strength from the darkest abyss despair loss the power of laughter in extreme deadly situations and the power of fear and what it drives us to It is a story of personal growth and personal development A true survival tale in the harshest of environments and what keeps us alive The psychology is explored and its role in life and the pursuit of survival It is the emotional quotient that drives this film the masterful direction and masterclass acting by Bullock and Clooney The sheer craftsmanship of this film by its director and stellar cast make this film excellent in every way Bullock and Clooney are artists they bring to life create these personalities and characters who will leave you in awe I shall certainly watch it again And despite the idiot who kept kicking my seat every 2 minutes even that did not deter my attention This is a great film Word of advice Please do not take little children to this film I had 2 children sitting a few rows down who were so restless and kept talking the whole way through until a woman stood up to reprimand the parents The parents received many more complaints,10

26 October 2013,Dreadful and wonderful,Through a succession of terrific adventures and incidents after an accident in outer space we follow two astronauts a man and a woman fighting against adverse conditions resulting of the total absence of gravity in which they move most of the time in open space floating and sometimes drifting helpless at random The appalling visual scenes are filmed with great mastery and the performers do a great job with special mention of Sandra Bullock The visual effects are of excellent technical quality This movie has practically no story or plot since its main theme is made of the astonishing rhythm of dreadful and wonderful scenes that make the viewer to hold his breath most of the time This is the more important aspect of the movie and makes it worth to be seen Of course we must take for granted the unlikelihood of a few scenes like it is usual in this kind of movies,7
31 December 2018,Visually impressive and a great adrenaline ride!,When I first saw it in the theaters I was impressed and having just re watched it after reading all the critics I am not changing my rating Yes the science may not be sound yes there is no convoluted plot and yes there are some details that don t make much sense about the character s situation But this is supposed to be a thrilling stunning ride that just takes you out of reality and out of breath for an hour an a half and if you let it you won t regret it Also great performance from Sandra Bullock directing and pacing on point as well,9

27 February 2014,A fun ride and an amazing story,I felt so good after leaving the theater This movie was so entertaining that I couldn t sit still in anticipation Yes there are some scientific errors but they are so minor that they honestly do not take away from the movie at all I think people need to list and number all the factual mistakes to make themselves feel smart It s a movie Deal with it I also saw this movie in 3D which really brought to life the special effects Don t go in with extremely high expectations and don t try to act like a know it all genius Have an open mind and just enjoy the best of what Hollywood has to offer because its actually really cool,9

23 December 2013,Space Thriller,Alfonso Cuaron s gripping 3D extravaganza finally delivers a movie well worth its 3D special effects which puts to shame the simplistic idiocy of Avatar Around the Earth s orbit a team of American astronauts are repairing communication lines on a space shuttle While scientist engineer Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock focuses on the technical issues experienced slightly cowboyish Matt Kowalski George Clooney frivolously space walks engaging into boyish banter of did I ever tell you of the time When a Russian destruction of a obsolete satellite results in the a cascading domino effect of catastrophic scale the shuttle is destroyed with Kowalski and Stone drifting in space with oxygen slowly running out Not exactly a sci fi as basically the only element that hints at anything remotely other worldly is a short dream sequence near the end of the movie Apart from that save for some small script liberties this is a factual riveting thriller basically as down to earth as cosmic space stories goes as possible Sandra Bullock returns to form with her great portrayal grasping all the moments from despair and panic to resignation and the will to live She is also expertly paired up with the whimsical but stoic Kowalski together with some superb visuals and perfect building of tension bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase In space no one will hear you scream The dramatic philosophical edge to the movie may not work as well with the whole backdrop of Stone s dead child somewhat struggling to add relevance to the story nonetheless this is in no way written or delivered in a substandard way thus not of any detriment to overall enjoyment Required watching Just for the thrill of it If nothing else,8

15 December 2013,"Merely a visual spectacle, otherwise pointless and mercifully short",I m going to be one of the few to say what horrendous tripe this movie was Thankfully we saw it in 3D on the big screen Anything else is a complete waste of time IMHO The beginning of the film starts good with an interesting premise But once things start to go wrong everything goes wrong with this film It would be better titled Mission Impossible and it s a very short film that tacks on an additional hour out of what could have been a neat 30 minute film This won t ruin the film but was one of the funniest lines I heard from the audience who also felt that this was an empty preposterous story that was as vacuous as space itself He said Let me guess and here comes the shark You ll understand it when you see it and it will probably give you a great laugh since there is no film that Hollywood cannot ruin,5
4 October 2013,Will be revered for generations to come.,Comparisons to Kubrick s sacred 1968 masterpiece 2001 A Space Odyssey may seem premature but I see no reason why Alfonso Cuaron s sumptuous space saga won t be revered just as highly for generations to come Gravity is undoubtedly one of the most visually stunning and awe inspiring films of the year hell the millennium with it s flawless CGI immersive 3D and technically astounding single shot sequences Cuaron announced himself as a ground breaking filmmaker with his superb Children of Men back in 2006 but he outdoes himself here with the reported 2 years of post production paying off in spades Never do you feel like you re not hundreds of kilometres in the sky floating around gasping finite amounts of oxygen in an environment where no one can hear your pleas of rescue and your thoughts are louder than the explosions that tear apart space stations There s never a second of superfluous material or plodding narrative every frame is meticulously crafted every word of dialogue essential and every note of music encapsulating keeping you enraptured both optically and aurally from start to finish Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are in fine form too generating real emotions despite being stuck in bulky spacesuits for majority of the runtime and occasionally having to handle the tricky proposition of talking to themselves If you re a fan of cinema then do yourself a favour and fork out your hard earned cash to view the glorious Gravity on the big screen it ll be an experience you won t soon forget,10

4 October 2013,The GRAVITY Of This Outer Space Situation,Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space even if it is just above the Earth s atmosphere that Hollywood has made after films like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY MAROONED and APOLLO 13 films that it resembles quite strikingly at times GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself and the remaining shuttle crew The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth s surface with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the heavily damaged International Space Station but again many further complications arise Only after a hair raising eye popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station which itself has suffered tremendous damage Bullock understandably in a huge panic has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re entry not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re enters the atmosphere Whether seen in the regular wide screen format in 3 D or in the specialized IMAX 3 D where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program THE DREAM IS ALIVE GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3 D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects though the budget stayed at 80 million the effects don t overshadow the storyline or the characters which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big budget spectacles of the 21st century What is perhaps most remarkable about GRAVITY is that it was a Mexican born filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron who also directed 2001 s Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and 2004 s HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN who both directed and co wrote it along with his son Jonas Even with all the ultra high tech bells and whistles at his disposal Cuaron in general has made a film that has a lot of the grace of 2001 the extreme tension of MAROONED and the dogged realism of APOLLO 13 films that it can stand up to comparison quite well Most of the film s focus is on Bullock using her intelligence and hard won courage to ensure her own survival which had best been hinted at before in the 1994 action blockbuster SPEED Even Clooney is on for only the first 40 minutes of this 90 minute saga and Ed Harris who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13 is only credited with being the voice of Mission Control In essence GRAVITY is an outer space character study and Bullock is the character in question and she carries that role quite well All of these things serve to make GRAVITY one of the best films of 2013,10

27 October 2013,I used to think being an astronaut was great... but for sure you see a hell of a landscape,As everybody knows there are only two actors in the movie and they wear spacesuits and helmets most of the time Therefore acting and human interaction are not the key Personally I think too much time was given to Sandra Bullock and her dramatic situation Clooney would have provided some buoyancy and made the movie more interesting character wise If I have to point out one major defect I found it silly to have Bullock look so good with no sign of injuries or dirtiness and with her hair perfectly combed Yes she was mercifully make up free but otherwise she looked like she had just stepped out of her bed after a refreshing night s sleep For me the film is an ode to the beauty and dangers of space the only virgin territory left to explore I used to think that being an astronaut was great but I had to reconsider Besides the film is an example of 3D put to good use The three dimensional effects worked wonders in most sequences We see earth and all the meteorological events we observe from down here we see sunrise from an astonishing angle small objects float towards us and we even get the personal point of view of gazing through the helmet of one astronaut The soundtrack was also great underlying dramatic moments without being too bombastic There was also a major technical blunder which you can found out by yourself but on the whole I must confess I am a sucker for movies set in space where the space is the main character and I got totally lost in this one,9
7 March 2014,Could not shut off my brain enough to like this,The story was so bad I don t even have pity for it Science and any reality are completely tossed out the window in this film Alfonso Cuar n doesn t even try to have something remotely believable There was talk about them creating suits and special effects that realistically portray current life in space All lies I could have overlooked some bending of the rules but they tossed them all out The characters themselves are supposed to be trained astronauts but not one second of on screen time shows this Most of the time they are incompetent then magically they can fly a ship they have little or no experience with like they ve done it all their lives When Sandra Bullock s character is almost out of oxygen George Clooney character is there trying to make sure she uses up as much of it as she possibly can The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects house did a wonderful job on making things pretty,1

3 May 2014,"Stunning Effects and Beautifully Directed,but Certainly Overrated,",Gravity is a decent movie with a great storyline and a talented cast The movie is without a doubt one of the most stunning and realistic movies ever made but I was still disappointed by it it was just too hyped up for me I thought that at times the movie relied much more on effects rather than story which is always a problem and also the movie was way too short with a length of only an hour and thirty minutes a movie like this could have been longer than two hours there is so much more in space that this movie could have explored I m not saying it should have shown aliens or anything because it isn t that type of movie but we could have seen some beautiful shots of other planets and galaxies it would have looked beautiful and would have added so much more to effect of the movie Sandra Bullock does deliver a beautiful performance however and is certainly the highlight of the movie she delivers a very dramatic and emotional performance and it s movies like these that show why she is one of the most successful actors in Hollywood at the moment I do think Gravity is overrated but it s still very beautiful and enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or sci fi Two astronauts work together to survive and keep calm after they get stranded in space Best Performance Sandra Bullock Worst Performance George Clooney,6

10 October 2013,Best movie of the year,Gravity defies its genre Its a science fiction yet feels head spinningly real From the first frame to the last Alfonso Cuaron takes his audience right into a place 600km above earth and you are bound by the taut tale of two marooned astronauts The story isn t new actually the story is just a single line but the visualisation the imagination the cinematography the background score the special effects are probably the best I have ever and I mean ever seen This is not movie but an experience which no movie lover should ever miss And if 3D was invented for some reason it was for this movie Now my premature predictions for this years Oscars Best movie best direction best cinematography Best Special effects best sound mixing best actor in a supporting role are a bare minimum 10 10,10
3 November 2013,Stunning in every single way possible.,GRAVITY is a space sci fi film directed by Alfonso Cuaron starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney The film revolves around two astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney who get drifted off into space after being hit by debris With low oxygen levels and the possibility of death they must work together to survive the accident and return back to Earth So the first thing that makes Gravity so different from the rest of the mainstream movies nowadays is obviously its a movie that takes place completely in space but other that that it has a very different tone to it Right from when you see the trailer you can literally see how the directer plays with your senses using the pitch and type of music along with the visual effects Its truly amazing and eerie at the same time I went and saw the movie in IMAX 3D because well you don t usually see a space film with a plot in IMAX and I m going to cut short this and just say GRAVITY IS JUST STUNNING Thats what everyone s being saying right But WHY Well here s why The acting is just first class Even there are just two stars in the movie using a green screen they portray their character so damn well They are one of the reasons for the intensity you feel all throughout Sandra Bullock is one the BEST things in the film she s as good as the special effects in this film and that s a really high bar You can see the fear in her eyes that seems like she s slowly losing hope but still has this unknown push to keep trying She s just so good in Gravity and if she doesn t get nominated for an Oscar this year I m going to flip out George Clooney s acting is quite decent Throughout the film you feel like you re in the head of Sandra Bullock s character and whenever she s nervous you re nervous and to sum it up George Clooney is the guy who keeps you calm when you re having a panic attack He s the smooth talker that keeps the level of intensity just to the right amount That s another one of the best things about this film The acting makes you feel like you re another one of the characters in space feeling what they re feeling Another contribution to that is the directing because you literally feel you re right in there with Sandra Bullock The visual effects and splendid and mind boggling They aren t shot with IMAX cameras so that was a bit of a letdown considering they had so much of potential with it but the visuals make up for it and the 3D is just great and isn t any of that post converted crap The directing and camera work is great too The way they zoom in on the face as well as the views of the Earth Its all just so realistic The soundtrack is extremely suitable for the film There s this sense of calmness yet drama in it Its wonderful how its portrayed in the film The film starts off with the main title flashing across the screen and the music going extremely high and suddenly it cuts to the view of the Earth and there s dead silence Great way to get the audience involved and feeling eerie The trailer also makes that pretty clear and the movie just carries that message forwards The plot is quite simple honestly but its the rest of the components of the film that has made the film shine And to be honest I have no problems with it The only issue that some people will find is that fact that they have no gravity defying action stunts or some cheesy villain driving fast cars You must have the patience to stay through every one of Ryan Stone s thoughts to actually enjoy it It is quite slow but its really intense and just good fun And to that I m going to say Gravity is just amazing Its visually breath taking and one of cinema s best achievements yet GRAVITY 9 5 10,9
15 October 2013,"In a World of Remakes and Sequels, Gravity Brings Originality!",Let s be honest The movie theater is filled with remakes and sequels and ideas that are more or less redone to death Even the dozen trailers I saw before watching gravity had at least 3 4 movies that were clearly remakes Gravity is a movie that you see if at the very least to take advantage of 3D technology which fits very few movies This is one of them The visual effects and 3D are some of the best ever The movie doesn t use 3D quite as good as Avatar but it definitely holds it own You believe you are with the characters and at some points you feel like you are actually in outer space The movie is short by modern standards but it feels like the perfect length You aren t wishing the movie last longer but don t feel like you are short changed The sound is great and if you can find a premium sound system like Regal RPX 3D then you are in for an epic ride The acting is great and Sandra Bullock definitely deserves an Oscar nomination While people want to mention about the physics errors and flaws in the movie I say it only shows how great everything else is about this movie It is like arguing why Godfather is bad because Michael Corleone shouldn t look so handsome being a war hero and all Overall see this movie while it is in theaters and in 3D I have a feeling it won t be as epic when it arrives on DVD Blu Ray It will only be a very good movie instead 9 10,9
5 March 2017,Visuals Are Spectacular But The Plot/Characters Are Just...Okay,Heading into the theater to see this movie I thought that it was going to be a great experience I had heard high praise from friends it fits neatly into my favorite genre of movies science fiction drama and it just looked like a really really cool concept Unfortunately I left the theater feeling ambivalent For a basic plot summary Gravity tells the story of two astronauts who are stranded in space after a freak satellite accident pummels their shuttle and sends them both adrift Matt Kowalski George Clooney is the cool cocky non stop energy personality while Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is the nervous scared out of her element type They must somehow find a way to survive in the vacuum of space while planning a return journey to Earth I will say this about Gravity the visuals are absolutely astonishing It really makes you feel as if you are in space with the two astronauts I didn t even see it in IMAX but I can imagine that would be even a more visceral experience The trouble for me however is that I felt that the plot characters were never really developed enough to truly care when it all starts to come together in the end It almost seemed as if director Alfonso Cuaron tried to tackle too many things at once and didn t really nail any of them There were shades of horror suspense drama reality and even humor sprinkled into the experience but in the end I just didn t feel the emotion that is needed for such a character driven film like this one to be considered great Thus aside from the spectacular visuals I was disappointed with Gravity It isn t a bad movie per se so three stars are in order but 2 5 would be my more exact ranking It just never sucked me into the plot or characters,5
4 October 2013,"A stunning movie with twists, amazing visuals and breath taking moments",The movie will take you on a ride of your life There are many twists breath taking moments amazing effects and visuals and best of all more or less realistic physics Gravity has finally brought back the interest in space movies since 2000 when a lot of space movies were thrown into the theatres but most of them were quickly and badly made Gravity is a must see in 3D or IMAX it is pretty much as amazing as Avatar But do remember it is a thriller and it might send a chill down your spine for most of the film One of the key things is that it can fill you with some knowledge of what is up there and really shows how space debris can cause damage So just go and watch the movie you won t regret it G Colony and Sandra Bullock acted very well and showed the emotions of their characters very well,10
10 July 2017,Painful To Watch,It is obvious that they try to drag every single scene as long as possible in an effort to fill the time This movie is essentially a monologue and it is not a good one It is painfully slow The first scene when she gets separated without contact lasts a good five minutes when it should have been 1 minute at most She is separated lost contact OK we ve got it move on I appreciate what the the original writers were going for but unfortunately they allowed mainstream Hollywood to get a hold of it and destroy any potential it might have had Let s face it mainstream cinema just can t truly make an independent idea into a good film No exception here It gets one star for the concept and one star for casting Sandra Bullock She did the absolute best with what she had,2
25 October 2013,Excellent Sci-Fi Drama FILM!!!!,I don t know how to start PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE IN 3D I went yesterday night to see this amazing film in 4DX and it WORTH every PESO I PAID I just can say please go and see it Please don t expect an action film Aliens style this one is more realistic but obviously there are a lot of fantasy moments but closer to reality that other space films You will feel the emptiness of the space space is not friendly you will miss our warm fresh gravity earth Sandra Bullock is not one of my favorites for this kind of films but she did a great work Alfonso Cuaron and Emmanuel Lubezki are a winner team Lubezki is a genius and he will win an Oscar for the AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHY EARTH AND SPACE ARE BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED,10
27 October 2013,A definite must watch for lovers of good cinematography,Gravity pulled me back into the world of space stations astronauts and dangers of space junk A world of wonder that I experienced watching recordings from space shuttle missions and Hubble documentaries And I am happy about it The main stars are Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney and they are the only people whose living faces we see throughout the movie What we see are probably the best space visuals in a movie that have been ever part of a non documentary The visuals are crisp and steady A welcome change from all the shaky cam that we see in the recent cinema An interesting and refreshing point was proper use of the first person camera I felt as if I was looking from inside of the space suit I felt that strange mix of claustrophobia and agoraphobia that is possible to experience only in the vastness of space while being in this insignificant amount of fabric and tech These shots were few which made them significant and were well established in the relationship to the surrounding so I knew where I was looking at all times One of the harder things to achieve in the emptiness of space The film was perfectly paced for a space movie Coming into the movie I was ready for extremely slow space walks but Cuar ns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones The plot was fairly standard but here again Cuar ns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid film One major problem with the movie was that it did not make me care for Stone which was essential to sink into the movie Cuar ns made a strange decision to make her a person without family Meaning that her only motivation to survive was her own survival instinct But this decision meant that Stone could explore some topics that are available only to people without stronger survival motivations On a more nit picky note what was with that in your face symbolism of a womb in the middle of the movie Either I have not noticed other symbols or in a film with a very few symbols there is one that is sticking out and heavily disrupting the flow of the story,
5 December 2013,Gravity sucks (and so does the movie),Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
6 February 2014,"Regardless of physics laws broken Gravity pulls you in, start to finish. A must watch.",Firstly I would like to illuminate the vastness and incredible wonderment that is our galaxy Our Milky Way is spinning at an amazingly fast rate of 225 kilometers per second In addition to this the galaxy is traveling through space at around 300 kilometers per second This basically means that we are rocketing along at speeds of 530 kilometers per second Annually our big old smiley moon moves further from us here on earth by 3 8cm This is believed to be a result of tidal effects The energy in the sunlight we see at present came all the way from the Sun s core around 30 000 years ago This energy spent the vast majority of this time passing through the thick atoms of the sun and only a mere 8 minutes to reach the earth s atmosphere once it had left that fiery ball of fury we call the Sun Crazy I know But as Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad famously said Science bi Feeling small Well Gravity initially instills this same feeling and then so much more Gravity is a wild space roller coaster action film surrounding a major catastrophe caused by space debris colliding with a US satellite and the team left fighting for their lives and the impossible contingency to make it back home safely to earth And yes whilst many of the physics laws are bent to suit aesthetically and as a narrative this film is completely worthy of all praises Let s start with the casting with so much resting on Sandra Bullock I will admit I was certainly a skeptic however I could not fault her performance once you looked past her rather uninspiring career with some terrible zone out and how were they ever funded sequels and original films such as Speed 2 one of the lowest rated films on IMDb scoring 3 6 10 Miss Congeniality 2 The Proposal 2 Weeks Notice Premonition and Forces of Nature It was almost enough to make Steven Segal look good almost It was for this exact reason I didn t see this in cinemas and am now of course kicking myself harder then Guy Ritchie for both marrying Madonna and helping her make a movie I digress Sandra Bullock who plays a hardware engineer encapsulates the character in every aspect and the emphatic feelings are well drawn for her character as you are taken along for the ride with her Whilst her character realistically would most probably never have been hired by NASA she as a character pulls on the heart strings and makes your heart ache for all she has and will go through In short I am thrilled Angelina Jolie dropped this role Mission commander Matt Kowalski played by the sterling silver fox George Clooney who received the role after Robert Downey Jr pulled out with scheduling conflicts was perfect for the role and somehow took the geek factor out of the profession and brought a charm energy and cowboy style to the role and hit the nail head on He makes it look good and romances space with an impeccable delivery and my only wish was that more was told about his character The cinematography which of course is vastly computer generated animation took 4 years for the directors to be happy with and it certainly was worth the wait Looking down at the looming earth you feel like you are right there and every bump jump and spin of the astronauts is shared with the audience The action sequences are epic and the force and pressure are very well designed to give the feeling of complete helplessness in space where nobody can hear you scream Terrible The films tag line Don t let go is fully incorporated in a visually stunning film which will surely educate and inspire future film greatness Watch this movie preferably on the biggest sharpest screen with the best audio possible Fasten your seat belt cause planet Earth is going bye bye I give Gravity 8 9 out of 10,9
5 December 2013,Great thrill ride,Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is an inexperienced astronaut repairing a satellite Matt Kowalsky George Clooney is a veteran close to breaking the spacewalk record Meanwhile a Russian attempt to bring down a satellite sets off a chain reaction as a cloud of debris destroys the shuttle Then Stone and Kowalsky scrambles to get another way return home As a story there isn t much As a movie it s a thrilling ride Director Alfonso Cuar n is using all the latest tech to create a believable adventure The action is so realistic that it s like a scary amusement park ride The leap forward is that the astronauts are so realistic It could have been so easily reduced to a video game But I actually believe the actors were in the suits and we were crashing into all those space stuff It s a must see on the big screen,8
2 November 2013,An experience of a film unlike any other,We waited long enough to see what Alfonso Cuaron had in store for us next but no one expected a visual effects game changer Gravity is an experience something you might expect to see at a science museum in IMAX but with an intense plot And even though its minuscule cast and real time feel expose it to plot holes and improbabilities it is truly something to behold Sandra Bullock stars as Dr Ryan Stone a genius engineer on a mission to update the Hubble Space Telescope with a crew of veteran astronauts including Matt Kowalsky George Clooney on his late mission before retirement When a Russian missile strike on a satellite goes awry it causes a field of debris to come flying at their shuttle but before they can entirely abort the mission the shuttle is obliterated and Kowalski and Stone are sent hurtling into space with little chance of survival Gravity shares qualities with both disaster films and sci fi space opuses In the context of outer space Cuaron s long takes are reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey but Gravity is less intellectual and more of a survival tale with poetic aspects It consists of a range of tones from intense to reflective from claustrophobic to vast and empty all within a 90 minute run time You ll feel this movie in your bones after you get up No matter how you feel about Gravity taking the time to consider how the film was made will turn any opinions into total admiration Although none of us can truly relate to the physics of space creating a movie in which gravity does not exist notice the poetic irony of the title has to be considered a hell of a feat And Cuaron doesn t just make a movie set in space he insists on making it feel as though it were filmed in space He tries just about everything with the camera from shots inside Stone s helmet to seemingly endless tracking shots Pulling this off with as much authenticity as he appears to have is worth nothing short of a high commendation The lack of characters in Gravity puts a lot of pressure on Bullock and Clooney to be interesting enough to capture our attention Bullock s constant panic is painful but in doing so she maintains the film s adrenaline rush and her humanity wins enough sympathy to make the quest for survival at the heart of the story work Without a strong performance here Gravity would in fact slowly drift into obscurity she provides a vested interest in the outcome of the disaster Gravity contains very few traditional storytelling devices Only the sequence of events has a Hollywood feel to it in that it s rather contrived there s no way Stone manages to come out unscathed during various debris showers for example Moments of disbelief will crop up all over Gravity so when you add in the slower imagery driven moments along with some dialogue that s squeezed in so that we get to know Stone a bit it s a surprise that the reaction to Gravity has been so universally strong Without question Gravity demonstrates what 3D filmmaking is supposed to look like and be used for and should set the bar for filmmakers aspiring to use it Considering Cuaron directs the film to be an immersive experience the 3D magnifies this effect to a considerable degree Few films have conveyed the experience of a movie the way Gravity has an accomplishment that makes fretting over the script contrivances feel like a petty waste of time that totally misses the point Gravity will long be remembered as a defining example of the history and development of filmmaking in the 3D era Steven C Thanks for reading Check out more at moviemusereviews com,9
9 October 2013,Already a Classic.,Gravity is a suspenseful action survival adventure that sets new standards in terms of a realistic depiction of what it feels like to be an astronaut in outer space The visual effects are just amazing and are only surpassed by the unique claustrophobic atmosphere created by the simple fact that nothing more than the small narrow oxygen filled shell within your space suit separates you from the deadly vacuum out there Being lost in space we by the magic of the movie camera which is digitally floating in all imaginable directions literally witness the dramatic struggle for life through the bloodshot eyes of Sandra Bullock who in a brilliantly intriguing performance tries to find a way back to Earth while she is irretrievably running out of her oxygen supply were it not for the treacherous crunching sound of people eating popcorn the illusion would be complete George Clooney as the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalsky always overshadowed by Bullock s powerful play as Dr Ryan Stone is the only help providing some hope in a obviously desperate situation As a rather chattering person he contributes to comparatively few dialogs that are unfortunately not always free from typical Hollywood clich s Strictly seen this movie has a very thin plot as the director apparently puts much more emphasis on the space experience itself which is underlined by a great vibrant score crucial to its huge success since apart from some radio transmissions between the protagonists there is of course no sound in the vacuum we would be able to hear this lack of sound being another tribute to realism as far as it s compatible with the regularities of a blockbuster Alfonso Cuar n did not intend to make a documentary about disasters in space instead he delivered a very authentic minimalistic science fiction thriller that can easily form a line with all the great SF Classics of movie history The little kid in you who has always dreamed of becoming an astronaut will definitely leave the theater being nothing but satisfied,9

8 January 2014,Disappointed,I don t understand why the ratings have been so high for this movie It s just okay The visuals are great but the rest is mediocre Sandra Bullock s character is very annoying and incompetent for most of the film Like a woman that trips and falls when being chased it s just an excuse to ratchet up the tension with a weak character instead of a tough situation The character s back story seems contrived just to introduce some character arc It s shows satellites and space stations within site of each other Completely unrealistic This movie completely lost me when it had a Vertical Limit any good climber would cut the rope type scene A completely contrived situation that defies the physics of space just to try to be dramatic All it did was completely destroy any suspension of disbelief I was trying to maintain I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST IMDb grades anymore This is just 21 century madness marketing,1
1 April 2019,"Watched it on a 50 inch screen, meh. Watched it with an oculus Rift in 3D, woah!",Watched this a few years ago at home on tv Wondered what all the hoopla was about Then I watched it a few days ago with my Oculus Rift in 3D Holy Messiah what a revelation I was there in space with them all the time Totally different experience Get a decent VR HMD and watch it in 3D Your mind will be blown,10
4 March 2014,'Gravity' is pretty heavy,Gravity is if nothing else a technical marvel It instantly pulls you into its environment and makes you feel as if you re along for the ride And what a ride For ninety harrowing white knuckled minutes you re tethered to Sandra Bullock s character as she fights for survival in the cold black vacuum of space But the movie is more than just F X wizardry The performances by Bullock and co star George Clooney anchor the story and give it a beating human heart It does get a little sentimental and existential in the final act but I forgave this because it felt earned Like Avatar before it Gravity is bound to be one of the seminal sci fi movies of the early 21st century,8

4 October 2013,Gravity is an experience,The first image in Gravity is a space shuttle slowly floating towards us Of course in actuality the space shuttle is moving incredibly fast but speed seems relative in space On the space shuttle is Ryan Stone a medical engineer Matt Kowalski and Shariff both astronauts They are installing a new system to better view the universe I think something like that It really doesn t matter because in a few minutes the space shuttle is going to get hit by debris sending the story off A story about a character s will to survive in the most hostile environment most people will never know That s the story Most of the dialogue in the film is very situational based Except for one scene when one of the characters divulges a rather traumatic event in their life But the film could be completely silent for the movie goes far beyond story In space sound can t travel a point that is made in many films involving scenes in space However most films that contain scenes in space ignore this and when a ship explodes we hear it explode When a person opens a door in space we hear the door To Alfonso Cuar n s credit he does not shy away from the terrifying silence of space In moments of sheer terror the audience is left in the quiet Most of these moments are filled with musical score but they would be just as effective without as well I found myself sometimes wanting to scream in frustration at the characters on screen in these tense moments But I didn t need to In the silence I found the sound of the audience in the theater yelling at the characters for me Most films that employ visual effects the effects are noticeable What I mean by that is when watching an action film you can tell when a real object shot by a camera has turned into a CG object No matter how good CG gets this fact will probably always be true Space is an interesting place to portray using visual effects Space is not a place many of us will ever go in our lives It is a place filled with mystery It is the most terrible and yet the most awe inspiring place And the visual effects in Gravity portray space and the events that unfold in it brilliantly I could not see the filmmaking I had no idea how they filmed it I would imagine mostly in front of a green screen but I just couldn t tell I thought I was in space I was completely engrossed On a side note I did not feel that the IMAX or the 3D improved the viewing experience When watched again yes I have already watched it twice now in a normal 2D theater the film was just as breathtaking and exhilarating Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are great at playing their prospective roles The cinematographer is dazzling I felt as though the cuts were non existent I was never aware of an edit almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story But as I said before Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story It is an experience I truly believe that any film sets up its own expectations for the audience as to what kind of film it will be and what the ultimate conclusion should be Every movie has a beginning and they all should have a feeling of barreling to the end And once we get to the end of a great film there is a feeling that that ending was always going to be the ending The story was chaotic and out of control as it raced to this end and it was destined to be this way although perhaps I have a more romantic view of film than most normal people do,10
2 March 2014,Visually amazing,Great space thriller Visually amazing especially in 3D Special effects are incredible You could easily believe you are in space looking down on the Earth Plot will have you on the edge of your seat throughout Not perfect though as there are a few convenient contrivances Ending feels a bit trite Good performances by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Their impact on the movie is limited however as it not an actor driven movie more action and visual effects driven A revolution in special effects and cinematography,8

26 April 2014,A Unique Movie Experience,Unique I did not say perfect Sandra Bullock gives a better performance than her role in Blind Side but lost to a first time foreign black actress such is Hollywood Bullock is tense almost from the beginning Only a chatty George Cloney lightens her a little before the space storm hits She fears she panics she gives up temporarily then gets rejuvenated I won t say how then overcomes What made this a unique experience is she is all alone in space in the boundless void where few human have subjected too The struggle to survive is not new but the appreciation of the victory in just being able to walk on Tera firma is universally shared in fact this is why we go to the movies Thank God for gravity Without it we will all be float away somewhere While there is much to celebrate about the theme the movie isn t perfect Bullock s personal background of having lost her little girl is not well developed And I still have a hard time placing Bullock in a college science lab Her role as Dr Stone would have been more believable she appears more bookish George Cloney is too suave Those are minor flaws however if you just take in a unique movie experience By the way someone had mention Rachel Wiez be a better choice Agree totally But the bean counters at the studio wanted Bullock for the box office appeal,2
15 October 2013,Very disappointed,Maybe I shouldn t be reviewing this film because I didn t actually see the whole thing But that s because I fell asleep three times I think I love good sci fi movies and was really looking forward to this based on the trailers and rave reviews when it came out Now I am wondering did I see the same flick these people did Lets start with the plot There wasn t one At least not one that a third grader couldn t improve on The Russians yes those nasty Russians have destroyed one of their own satellites and have emperilled space travel for all mankind with the debris they have created Its never really explained why they did this but whatever What follows is endless and mindless scenes of Sandra Bullock tumbling through space after the shuttle she and George Clooney are on is destroyed right up to the predictable conclusion I would give a spoiler alert here but whats the point Anyone with a brain knows how this one is going to end five minutes after the movie starts And of course there are the predictable hallucinations of George reappearing and telling Sandra how to save herself after he has been killed Whatever I will give this film one positive the special effects are indeed spectacular I don t recall any movie that puts one into space quite like this one They even acknowledged that there is no sound in space which I don t think has been done since 2001 Which just made me realize 2001 had special effects better than Gravity with 1969 technology Now THAT was a sci fi movie Had a plot too,5

12 November 2013,One of the Best Movies of the Year and Possibly One of the Greatest of all time.,This is my first review for this site so just bear with me please Gravity is with almost no doubt the best movie of the year Keep in mind I have not seen 12 Years a Slave yet but I have seen Captian Philips which was astonishing and brilliant in so many ways but didn t reach the same heights as Gravity If there is ever to be a near perfect movie to be made this is it Everything from the acting to the visual effects is top notch and of the highest quality The visual effects being the standout here are so spectacular that many may wonder including myself how this wasn t actually filmed in space The attention to the tiniest of the tiniest of detail is amazing Every single texture every thread sewn into their clothes every particle of the dust floating around in the space crafts every ray of light emitting from the sun and bouncing off the metallic objects is 100 believable There wasn t a single moment throughout the 90 minute running time that I didn t believe what I was seeing on the screen If you are one of the many people who get annoyed with over the top special effects like me this movie will be the exception That also goes for 3D and IMAX I hate 3D HATE it This movie made me realize the potential 3D has for movies in the future It added a certain depth that couldn t be possible without it That brings me to the opening scene which is one of the most mesmerizing in movie history How can I explain it There isn t a single camera cut for the first 15 minutes of the movie Everything you see happens in one shot The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous as it is for the entire movie but here it really stands out The views of the Earth from space are breathtaking literaly The silence of it all really emphasizes how alone they really are in space Throughout almost the entire film there is no sound except for the astronaut s voices and the vibrations they feel through their suits So no there are no huge explosions or crashes that shake the theater because there is no sound in space anyone remember the tag line No one can hear your screams in space One might wonder if the movie would be boring because it would be silent the entire time right Actually it is quite the opposite Steven Price s musical score for this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word It takes the place of all the noises that you would normally hear in a movie It makes you really feel a sense of genuine fear and desperateness while also protruding an enormous emotional impact at the end of the movie This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in my life When talking of story plot and characters some would argue that it could ve been better I couldn t disagree more The plot is pretty streamlined and simple but that s the point It s not supposed to have a narrative that rivals Inception At it s core this is a story about the characters And as impressive as it is technically this movie has an excellent development of it s characters and takes them very seriously Sandra Bullock s character is once again the stand out here Her emotional journey throughout the movie has a great affect on the audience and will stay with them long after the movie is over I haven t enjoyed and appreciated a character arc this much in a very very long time I believe a lot of people are dismissing this movie as a stupid special effects money maker It is anything but that Director Alfronso Cuaron Children of Men has directed yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of the greatest achievements in movie making history This is only the 4th movie I ve ever given a perfect score of 10 10 to,9
8 October 2014,"It's poetry, so perhaps difficult to understand",For me this is a profound film because of its simplicity in expressing that it is necessary to face oneself alone in order to experience the amazing connection that we have with each other and everything else in the universe or life itself Aside from the CGI if you have experienced this facing yourself you can t not appreciate this film Most of the negative criticism of the film has been that the story is full of clich s Or that the CGI was off or that the story is simply too simple I remember living in Chile in 1963 and as a 15 year old watching Fellini s 8 1 2 I nodded off If someone had asked me then I probably would have responded that it was boring that I did not know what it meant This film has something in common with Fellini it s just more personal and dare I say it just as universal in its comment on being alive and human The tell here is that few comments I ve read mentioned corny In 1969 I was being asked to go to Vietnam I could not do this My father in his kindness paid 400 to retain a lawyer to advise me on what was involved in being a conscientious objector and that was what I pursued This involved writing an essay for the draft board to state for them why I could not do this That experience resulted in some 17 pages from examining myself going to the guts spirit soul and was literally facing myself looking in the mirror and the most terrifying experience I ve had in my life I am 66 have a wife son two grandkids Viewed many films read many books experienced some stuff that might challenge anyone s imagination But a child might know what this story is about It is not pleasant to be alone at least for most of us simply because we are connected with everyone and everything else If we were not there would be no responsibility and life would be ultimately boring I ve seen films from the Angry Red Planet through 2001 to this one I ve watched the NASA videos and so it is curious to me that some criticize the CGI The greatness of this story is that it is about you about me It is about what if and most about what now You are there You are going to die What will you do with your time whether hours or minutes or seconds Space is a vacuum Emptiness I am certain that many of you have experienced this vacuum right here on the planet What a wonderful thing that in this story some one of us who is a kind person with a good heart might experience the same thing and survive Provides a bit of hope Greg McCormick Pittsburgh Pennsylvania,9
19 October 2013,An unforgettable experience for the eyes and the mind.,Gravity is the kind of film that doesn t often get made in Hollywood The film was shot in the United Kingdom and distributed by Warner Bros Pictures Director Alfonso Cuaron manages to grab us from the beginning in this science fiction thriller with majestic views of Earth from space We get introduced to Dr Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney The performances by Bullock and Clooney are both excellent It s Bullock however who carries the film like an expert with a performance that makes her character sympathetic but also distant Bullock is known both for her comedic roles While You Were Sleeping Demolition Man and her dramatic roles Speed Crash Gravity is very much an experience and the film should be seen in a theater Cuaron combines drama and thrills for an emotionally satisfying result The excellent visual effects may make some viewers wonder how they were achieved They make us feel almost as if we re there in space with the characters It s worth mentioning that Cuaron s work and especially this film has been influenced by director Elem Klimov s great 1985 war drama Come And See If you watch both Gravity and Come And See you ll notice the striking similarities In addition to Cuaron s expert direction and Emmanuel Lubezki s stunning cinematography we re also treated to an effective soundtrack by Steven Price which works wonders in some scenes Some reviewers ranked Gravity on the same level as science fiction greats like Blade Runner 1982 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 and Solaris 1972 I m not going to jump to such conclusions at this time but Gravity is easily one of the best films of recent years I certainly recommend it,9

20 October 2013,An incredible space journey without wearing the special suits and oxygen cylinders.,More than a decade before when I first saw Ron Howard s APOLLO 13 1995 and then Stanley Kubrick s epic masterpiece 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 1968 it simply made me awestruck witnessing the unbelievable kind of execution by its immensely talented makers Besides I truly regretted the fact that I couldn t see such great films on the big wide screen with an outstanding sound system playing its enjoyable musical silence providing that out of the world experience to the viewers Moreover the films also gave me the thoughts that what if the astronauts have to repair their space shuttles by themselves by moving out manually in the unknown black vacuum and what if they need to ask help from any other country s space shuttle standing at a distance in a state of crisis and then have to reach it somehow covering the blind gap Thankfully GRAVITY is here with all the possible answers to my thoughts and the regret of not seeing any such space adventure in the theaters is now taken care of in an outstanding manner In simple words if you ever wished to feel the space and its deep silence like the trained professional astronauts then here is your chance to live those otherwise unachievable moments in the theater at the cost of only 300 bucks and that too without wearing the heavy space suits and oxygen helmets The film takes you into that black soundless region like never before and then makes you feel the excitement tension loneliness pain and discomfort of being in the space all alone with just the mechanical gadgets and machines Capable of transforming you into a different world space altogether GRAVITY is unarguably one of the best space adventure movies made till date which actually makes you wonder that was that beautiful absorbing ambiance all digitally created or they really shot those sequences by going into the genuine scary space in a shuttle Further opening with a ground breaking long shot introducing the theme right away GRAVITY not only keeps you absorbed with its breathtaking execution but also keeps you guessing through an engaging original script written around a rare space disaster Though for many viewers it might have less dosages of entertainment as expected but as a matter of fact GRAVITY rises much above than any recent spectacular gem such as AVATAR or LIFE OF PI because it is not really talking about anything fictional or deliberately created by the makers in order to provide a mesmerizing magical treat to their viewers It actually talks about the real existing space and the sudden unexpected catastrophe which possibly can happen with the people up there in the space shuttles anytime any moment Secondly the film gives you an entirely different and much superior experience as a 3D film comparatively since the technology is used quite wonderfully here matching its subtle yet electrifying subject matter moving ahead than any other 3D film to be precise Talking about this personally I have never seen a 3D movie by not taking off the glasses several times in those two hours to get some relief But here in GRAVITY I never thought of taking them off even once other than the intermission and was constantly watching it with the glasses on for the first time ever Thoughtfully skillfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron GRAVITY is a film which gets perfect contribution from every single creative person involved in its making superbly led by the Sound Cinematography and CGI departments in particular Though its silent moments speak for themselves in those tense sequences but the timely inclusion of many enjoyable dialogues and the well composed musical notes enhance the overall impact of the venture to many folds Brilliantly performed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney the actors successfully make a solid impact on the viewers even when you don t see their faces properly in a substantial part of the film till the end Particularly this is Sandra s another absolutely stunning performance of her career and she reportedly spent six months of physical training preparing for this role to play it in an authentic manner Interestingly apart from GRAVITY s technical artistic and creative attainment the film has a proud Indian link too wherein you get to hear one of the astronaut singing Mera Joota Hai Japani and then we have a duly acknowledged contribution in its soundtrack made by Delhi s own famous music producer Gaurav Dayal Last but not the least I would like to write about GRAVITY s less discussed rare spiritual or meditative feature which truly gives you an enlightening taste of that supreme invisible power hidden within this huge complex but smoothly working universe and its unexplained phenomenon The film takes you into those never ending silent infinite black spaces of the universe which simply make you realize that how tiny ineffective and momentary is our very existence on this planet Earth The Earth which itself is a very miniscule part of such an enormous universe and its numerous elements In fact this humble thought is very well defined in the last scene of the film itself when Sandra somehow manages to reach back planet Earth safely landing into the sea after a miraculous escape And the moment she again touches the solid surface of mother Earth there are only two words on her lips with eyes looking into the sky and those two words are THANK YOU GRAVITY ends on this very note giving us a fabulous thought to take back home indicating that the human race is only capable of saying just these two words in gratitude towards the beautiful existence And there is simply no other way we can repay back for such precious gifts showered upon ourselves by that Supreme Power since ages,10
13 July 2014,In a Word: Beautiful.,I have two major cinematic regrets from 2013 The first is that I believed that A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD couldn t possibly be as bad as the reviews were claiming I was wrong to trust that the series might regain it s footing Thanks Bruce Willis Now I have trust issues My second regret is that I foolishly failed to catch GRAVITY in theaters This movie is probably one of the most visually stunning films I ve ever seen The plot is fairly simple but the massively impressive production value more than compensates Director Alfonso Cuar n has crafted a thrilling survival film set in the harshest environment humans well a select few anyway have endured space It follows the tribulations of Dr Ryan Stone Stone is a mission specialist with NASA that has been sent into orbit to perform upgrades to the Hubble telescope in her first assignment Disaster strikes on her first spacewalk when the Russians destroy one of their satellites and the debris cloud rockets around in orbit detonating other satellites and creating a lethal wave of shredded metal careening around the Earth at 20 000 MPH The space shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed leaving Stone and mission commander Matt Kowalski as the sole survivors left drifting above the Earth and counting the minutes until the debris next deadly pass Stone will need to face her fears if she hopes to survive as she and Kowalski must find a means of returning to Earth alive I m a space geek and have been for as long as I can remember As much as I love science fiction and I do quite a bit there have been few films that have ever given much effort to portray space as it actually is There s always some sort of convenient technology to prevent the filmmakers from having to deal with the harsh realities of space travel GRAVITY isn t science fiction but is instead a survival drama set in the environment of space and Cuar n uses the full gamut of hazards that come with leaving the Earth s atmosphere There are no rocket boots to make maneuvering in space a simple task here Well there s a sort of jet pack unit used in limited capacity but the danger still remains that if Stone or Kowalski make one wrong move they will find themselves slowly drifting off for a lonely horrifying death as they wait for their air supply to run out GRAVITY isn t 100 accurate to the trials and tribulations of surviving in space and some liberties were taken for the sake of telling a story but it s so much more realistic than has been portrayed in pretty much any movie that s come before Cuar n and his team have found a way of realistically portraying total weightlessness so well that I couldn t wait to watch the behind the scenes footage to find out how it was done I loved that there were no sleek fancy spaceships and we get legitimate recreations of existing space structures such as the International Space Station And the visuals are just incredible This is a movie that for the utmost effect should be viewed in IMAX 3D I missed out and watched the movie in high definition when it was released on home video but I saw enough and was wowed enough to know that I had missed out on something incredible The Earth as seen from orbit is an amazing backdrop for a film and there was not a single moment of this film that I didn t find absolutely gorgeous I realize I ve spent most of this comment ranting about my love for the film s visuals but that s because it s the best reason to see this film The story is very simple Stone eventually left to her own devices must confront her fear of death and find a means of escaping her fate It s primarily just Stone Sandra Bullock traversing from one hope to another as she goes from station to station searching for a functional escape capsule while dodging the debris blender I hate to undermine it because it s still an exciting story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning Stone is a sympathetic character and we learn bits about her as the story progresses and watch as she eventually buckles under the pressure of her situation At this point we know that Bullock is a talented actress and she does well in this movie where she s pretty much the entirety of the cast for most of the film Cuar n and Bullock manipulate your emotions and keep you invested until the final frame and it all combines with the director s amazing vision to create one of the coolest movies I ve seen in a long time,9
21 October 2013,A Team Effort That Must Be Seen in Theaters,One thing that has been missing in these big blockbuster films in this day and age is the ability to have a solid story and merge it with A List talent and extraordinary technology Enter multiple blockbusters here This wasn t the case for Alfonso Cuaron and despite the years spent in production hell the payoff was extraordinary Using his ability to make long takes work in his favor Children of Men for those who haven t seen it he makes what could have been a disaster and turned it into cinema gold that doesn t make you feel stupid for spending money on it Along with Cuaron s incredible directing abilities there was the extraordinary acting of Sandra Bullock and a briefly seen yet meaningful George Clooney As A Lister s should they carry the film in ways very few people can and I m no Hollywood insider but I can imagine that the films 100 million budget was significantly inflated hiring those two and it was worth it As Dr Stone Bullock performs with her usual excellent acting and because of it we all relate to her in this film Someone who has to fight to survive in an environment that you never truly prepare for Disaster granted her character is in a situation only few can honestly understand but she represents more than those people Her character one can argue represents the everyday person who has to do whatever they can so they can get home it s someone who has to deal with work B S or someone who deals with issue after issue when all they want to do is complete their day Dr Stone is someone you can relate to and that s to the credit of Cuaron and Bullock in making that happen which comes to the biggest thing in films and in life in general I ll explain that later Then there s the graphics The graphics of this film is to say the least incredible and because of it makes it one of the very few films that actually deserved the 3 D treatment The best way to describe it would be to compare it to watching an IMAX documentary about space that s in 3 D it s that realistic It s one of those Avatar type films that you have to see in theaters in order to truly enjoy the film The details that were taken into account to make this movie as real as possible really is the deal breaker because if it wasn t considered the film would be at best average which comes to the only flaw in the film the script itself The story itself is not really anything to ride home about as it can be considered predictable and there are a few things you wish were avoided but it still doesn t take away from the film itself Much like Avatar Then there are the theoretical life lessons this movie brings by having you be a part of Dr Stone s journey and yes it s Dr Stone s journey not Clooney s even though his performance should not be discounted as he did a hell of a job All of these things lead to the film that is Gravity which brings this review to a full circle When you make a film it has to be a team effort if not it s going to a disaster of epic proportions You can scrap a script together put a couple A List actors in it and let the rest of it go Battleship is an example granted only Liam Neeson is A List but that s not the point But if you want to really make it work you have to have a quality director quality script and quality actors if you want to make it work That s exactly what happens here and because of it we re now given a film that could be a strong Oscar contender despite being a film that is usually anything but and that s to the credit of Cuaron Bullock Clooney and everyone who made it happen,9
9 August 2021,Awards should be rescinded,The worst stupidest space movie ever made 7 academy awards Clooney and bullock are the only ones in this Clooney should not have even been in it And bullock all she did the whole entire movie was ahhh ahhh uhhhh uhhh gasp pant ahhh ahhh ahhh uhhh then say eenie meenie miney mo That s what an astronaut says when pushing a button by chance Lmao At least we know what she sounds like in the sack Thats the whole movie What an F,1
26 December 2013,floating in space,Almost every pre Academy Awards season brings for me the big Hollywood movies disappointment A big studios film usually directed by famous or at least interesting directors getting raving critical acceptance and breaking audiences records for the year or for the eternity A few years back the name of the sensation was Avatar last year it was Lincoln I go I buy my popcorn I sit down with the best intentions of enjoying it and flop When I exit the cinema theater I ask myself Is this all What is the fuzz about This year with Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity it s even worse than in the past years Before you ask yes I have seen the 3D version in a well equipped cinema theater I saw it in good visual and sound conditions and I was not enthusiastic at all about the cinematography and sound effects I actually believe that cinematography was quite banal and the few moments when some screwdrivers flew to our faces could not compensate for a film that takes place 80 in the open space meaning open stellar space and cannot provide even the National Geographic documentaries effects or emotions The story is completely incredible from any point of view If this is supposed to be science fiction the science is completely flown and the fiction non credible In other words impossible on all grounds Neither can Sandra Bullock and George Clooney save this film To their defense I should say that they are given a very clich relationship to act Clooney s hero text actually provides some of the rare sources of emotion and fun in this film but this is too little Alfonso Cuaron directed previously at least one science fiction film I fell in love with Children of Men What a difference between the action ridden and the human tension there and the routine stuff we get in Gravity I can understand his attraction into making such a film it s a challenge for a director to film a story in either a small and confined environment or in the infinite space as here and some of the greatest successes came from movies with theme like this Unfortunately he was not up to the challenge on almost any respect,5
13 November 2013,OK but badly over-hyped,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,6
14 October 2013,A visual masterpiece,SPOILER FREE I loved this movie As a film and theatre student I often find myself ruining movies by being over critical of them Not this film What it lacks in depth of story it surely makes up for in technical and emotional prowess that I ve never seen before This is the first movie I have EVER seen where the 3D is not only a defend able option but is actually necessary to get the full enjoyment of the film 2 great things about this movie 1 It s special effects were not only seamless but also engaged my senses in a way no movie has done before At times it was hard to watch the screen because I felt as if I could actually be falling towards earth in space 2 Sandra Bullock As an acting student I ve learned how hard it is to be earnest and real when acting with a scene partner Bullock would have been doing the majority of her acting with nothing but a green screen And she maintained full emotional commitment the entire time Breathtaking TL DR This film is great It couldn t be done without the tech but that s fine It s a movie that WILL NOT be as good at home so go pay the extra 20 and see it in IMAX 3D,9
12 July 2014,Excellent Survival Story,I didn t think this movie would be that good with some of the reviews I ve seen so I waited until the movie was on HBO I m not sure why a lot of people don t like this movie This was an excellent tale of trying to survive with all the odds against you This movie draws you in and makes you root for the characters without actually getting in depth to their lives You don t need to know all about someone in a survival situation because it really doesn t matter what they did in the past Some things in the movie aren t realistic but its a movie its not real life so I m OK with it These are some of the CGI I ve seen in a long time I m not to sure why there s so many people who dislike this movie,9

10 November 2013,"Terrible, waste of time",The only thing that was this films saving grace was the 3D element The story is weak at best and why does George Clooney still think he is good looking didn t ever think he was personally cheesy yes And why they have that grandma Sandra Bullock in hot pants please I think she needs a visit from the fashion police Hands up any guy under the age of 50 that finds Sandra Bullock hot Maybe an attractive more shapely lady would have been better cast Don t get me wrong I have nothing against older ladies that cast a neutral silhouette but when u have a storyline worthy of inducing a coma in your viewers you need to keep the audience interested somehow Thank me later Too sum this film up I ve seen better episodes of peppa pig,1

19 May 2019,The 3D was worth it.,Visually one of the most stunning films I ve ever seen Even to the point where the whole endeavor felt so real and intensely terrifying In fact the whole thing was almost a long continuous shot of Sandra Bullock floating in space Normally I am against 3D but this is one of the very few films where the effect really added to the whole exhilarating experience,10
24 August 2019,"If the movie breathes, I like the deep breath of this!",I felt that I had difficulty breathing for this movie And the air was so fresh after watching Alfonso Cuar n fascinate me completely Ryan Stone was thrown to the universe and was left I had a heavy heat till watching because it s likely to be in the lack of oxygen If I were in her situation I would give up on survival quickly I m not good at the silence and the emptiness Perhaps it s harder to doubt your existance by yourself than the death The short of breathe which Cuar n depicted is including suffering as much as I don t want to watch it again In spite of it I am fascinated because my heart is shaken by a katharsis and a salvation enough to surpass them The impression and the comedy have the same gimmicks Those are carried by ups and downs of tension The more extreme the situation is the bigger the emotional range is In Japan it is called Zero Gravity But the original title is just Gravity So I realized that it is based on surviving on the earth while feeling the weight not meaning of the situation of zero gravity,9

15 December 2013,A grand space walk of a film,Films like this have the ability to convert anyone to a new medium 3D movies have been having a tough time of late but this film deserves your attention and turns the tables There is no tsunami wave of special effects or clich d pointing at the screen Instead the 3D is used incredibly well to illustrate depth and space in a way that is seminal Seriously no other film has ever made you appreciate or experience space like this as well for so long it kind of harks back to the impact that 2001 must have had on its release It is very much a lesson in how to use 3D properly and some of the views are beautifully done 3D really needed a shot in the arm and this film has even led to arch critics of 3D such as Mark Kermode of the BBC to accept that this film is a game changer The story is almost theatre as it really only involves two people Yet it works perfectly The acting is exceptional in this disaster movie as our leads try to get to safety after their space walk all goes terribly wrong The story is good and the action wonderful and believable a lot of tension in this and you ll be on th edge of your seat I can see this film leading the charges for awards in time I can t recommend this highly enough easily for me the best film of the year,9
12 October 2013,"A lot of hype, a little entertainment",With all the hype this movie is getting I was expecting a much better movie with a better script and sorry to say better acting Sandra Bullock was just average The special effects were outstanding but a script should contain more than gasping and screaming Bullock is being talked about for an Oscar but those of you who have this thought should really go see Blue Jasmine with Kate Blanchett George Clooney should be considered an extra in the movie who just delivers one liners but nothing meaningful I would imagine this movie was very low budget because everything centers around special effects versus a story line and drama,4
4 February 2014,A watchable movie.....,I am not fully aware that how gravity works around orbit of earth but the movie seems very close to actual physics I feel it personally that it would be horrible if someone stuck at the situation as shown in the movie The view of earth in starting is very watchable experience It also helps viewers to be involved in situation Viewers who watch these kind of movie for thrill will not be disappoint Everything is good in movie although you may feel that Sandra Bullock really really had great luck that day The over all thrill from this movie is good and enough to keep you sitting on chair for 1 30 hour without any problem I recommend it for watching,8
8 October 2013,Ridiculously average,I went to see this movie because of its multitude of positive reviews and the fact that I like the movie The Fountain So of course I went into this with great expectations and got very very disappointed The reason that the Fountain worked with its metaphysical exploration of life and death is because you got to know and liked the two leads In this movie you quickly like George Clooney s character and quickly dislike Sandra Bullock s character She is whiny and incompetent She needed a longer training time I would have quickly left her to die She just didn t garner any sympathy because of the way her character was written Well now for the good things The visuals were stunning for sure But the drama seemed force almost horror movie like I wish Cuaron had done better,5

27 February 2014,"An excellent, well written, designed and executed movie",Many other fine people have used many words to say why they loved this film and I pretty much agree with all of these reviewers so rather than recover old ground let me just say a few words about why I disagree completely with so many of the very low reviews this movie received and leave it at that I think i can best sum up my feelings towards these negative reviewers all of whom I can count on for getting almost every film that i like completely wrong and who are all males by relating a question one such person asked at the beginning of his review What am I missing here The movie is my least stinging response to that question Also one of the main complaints about the Physics of this film IE why would the safety line between the two main characters be tight is easy enough to answer it has to do with viewpoint IE if the camera is moving in the same way that the objects around it are rotating nothing appears to be moving or as Einstein said all objects are relative to all other objects Stupid choice then stupid choice now,10

20 October 2013,Shows that space can be both beautiful and scary,I just went to go see this movie today and I have to say that I was blown away by it I was expecting what I saw in the trailers but instead I saw something totally great and suspenseful When I saw the beautiful CG opening shot of the Earth and the space shuttle in space I was hooked Granted it starts off slow but once the real meat starts its a non stop roller coaster ride in space I wouldn t even call this a science fiction movie because the things depicted in this film can happen in real life right now The beauty of this film is that it depicts space in the most realistic way that it can and that also the weight of the film lies on the shoulders of only two actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock The special effects used for the space scenes are some of the best that I have seen in recent memory and out in space there is no sound except for muffled noises which adds to the realism The cinematography is used to great effect with a lot of first person view shots which adds to the tension The acting for the most part is great but Sandra Bullock gives an excellent performance as Ryan who gets stuck up in space with almost no way to get back down When she acts you pretty much feel for her character As I said before the movie starts off slow but once disaster strikes the pace picks up and almost never lets up and Cuaron s deft directing hand makes Gravity tense suspenseful and just plain beautiful due to the fantastically directed space scenes Couldn t expect anything less from the guy who directed Harry Potter 3 and Children of Men Easily one of the year s best films in my opinion,9
22 September 2019,Enjoyed it... again.,It s been a while since I watched this but it s a nice brief by today s standards 90 minutes that fit well into the afternoon I first watched this in a cinema in 3D with one of those chairs that shakes you around I m not a fan of gimmicks or 3D which is largely a gimmick but I have to admit it worked wonderfully for this film It is after all a film about floating around in space with several occasions to shake the hell out of you That s not all there is to it though Yes it s sentimental at its core and follows are fairly predictable story arc but it s still looks fantastic rattles along at an engaging pace sounds incredible and sets your teeth on edge There s some nice shots and tricks making full use of the fact that very little is real in camera pulling in through the helmet glass in the opening act It s also nice to see a strong female lead I m not a big Bullock fan but she seems to fit this role perfectly Clooney does his roguish clown thing well adding that counter humour to the ramping tension Yes it has an air of Really what the hell is gonna go wrong next but it s a disaster movie plain simple and I really enjoyed it again,10

14 February 2014,A parable on loss,Discounting one condescending reviewer who enjoyed flaunting his high IQ and disdain for all of us parasites my intellectual friends are missing the point This is not a movie about physics and what is or is not possible It is a parable of accepting loss Anyone who has experienced loss on the level of the main character will certainly benefit from this film As one who worked in CG I could rant on mistakes as they were aplenty however the film left me deeply moved and reconsidering my own life Loss of such a caliber is shattering Moving on so very difficult Thank you for a wonderful experience physics boondoggles and irate high IQs who have yet discovered emotions aside this movie has made me think about moving through pain Spoiler Some people felt howling seemed silly I was stunned when that happened Some of you may at some point in your life be so overwhelmed by grief and pain that you find yourself sitting in the bottom of the shower howling until you are horse and the water long gone cold It is a deep primeval response that will take you by surprise and leave you empty afterward It is my fervent wish that you never experience it,10
21 October 2013,Pray that you never get lost in Space!,I ve been writing reviews for movies for so long and movies like Gravity seriously deserve my assessment after all it s something that happens in the Space and not on the Earth I agree I am late in reviewing this cinematic brilliance and probably more than half of the people who follow my Posts would have already watched the movie by now and I am really sorry but I had other important things to do in Life in the last 2 weeks Gravity is undeniably the best Space movie made at least after Aliens from the 90s This movie literally transports you to space in every cinematic way possible The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if the Movie was actually shot in Space The storyline which is actually a Space documentary becomes incredibly interesting purely because of the realism through IMAX 3D the anticipation and suspense the director succeeds to build in every scene and the great acting by the Hollywood veterans Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and I am sure they already have one of their hands on the Oscar trophy for the next Year I would just say that the Movie is a visual masterpiece Yes I know everything you see on the screen is Fake and has been artificially designed through the CGI but it never feels artificial and that s primarily because it has been completely shot in Spectacular3D With 3D you feel the depth of the Space and experience the movie as though you re right up there Please do not miss to watch Gravity in IMAX 3D and not the regular 3D and pray that you never get lost in Space and if ever you do then at least pray that the Satellites don t crash throwing debris towards you and if they do then pray that the Space Stations are made Fire proof and that the controls and manuals are printed in English and if you are lucky till here then pray that you land on the Land and not in the Water The movie deserves 8 10 from me primarily because that was the closest I could ever get to a Space Craft the Space Station and the Space itself and not to mention the fear of being lost with no one around for light years far and not just miles,8

2 November 2013,A breathtaking thrill ride that will renew your love of going to the movies.,This year there s yet to be a wide released popcorn movie that succeeds in both complete originality and sheer mass enjoyment excluding maybe This is the End With Gravity Cuaron has given movie goers a reason to get excited creating possibly the best space movie since 2001 A Space Odyssey Gravity is a breathtaking sci fi thrill ride that will renew even the most cynical critic s faith in going to the movies It follows two astronauts struggling to survive a disaster that occurs while working on the international space station Outside of that it s difficult to discuss the plot without spoiling the many turns the film takes What can be revealed is that this is genuinely brilliant and brave filmmaking In lesser hands the awe inspiring spectacle of the long uncut takes and the groundbreaking CGI would be an excuse to slack in other areas Fortunately Cuaron pulls zero punches with the butt clenching tension and still manages to create a supremely personal film through the guise of an epic dilemma with help from a particularly heart wrenching performance from Bullock There are some clich s I would like to apply here that while overused are totally applicable Gravity is like riding a ride Gravity is like no experience I ve had at the movies Gravity reminds us of why we go to the movies Hackneyed as these statements may be they are apt in describing Gravity the best film of the year so far,9
2 October 2014,I don't get the hype,I honestly don t get the hype about this or understand why this was Oscar nominated Sure it s a pretty space movie with decent cinematography but it s lacking any sort of plot never mind solid characterization with any sort of depth I kept waiting for the movie to begin for something to happen to be shown anything about these characters that actually made me care I was still waiting as the credits started to roll The dialog was predictable the imagery prosaic and clich and the conclusion inevitable Nothing about this film impressed or surprised me except how much everyone loved it I was bored and bitterly disappointed,2
12 November 2013,Empty,Why was this movie made What was the purpose Other than showing some great special effects there s nothing more to it There is absolutely no story The few lines are so clich There are no relationships between the 2 actors Nothing It has no soul Its just Sandra struggling in space And even though i like Sandra Bullock and i believe her acting here is amazing for what she was given to work with having to sit for 1 and 1 2 hrs just to watch her float in space is too much The only interesting thing was the story about the girl with the hairy guy Still wondering what happened there,2

14 October 2013,"A+ for effort, execution, and enjoyability",Gravity does things with the sound and cinematography that other movies only dream of doing Frequently filming from the first person the film attempts to put you in the place of an astronaut adrift in space It succeeds in a big way Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes The cinematography of this film is visionary There is never an up or down to limit the camera A common camera trick is to show the camera at a crooked angle to show uneasiness Every shot in Gravity is at a crooked angle because there s never a clear up or down That use of cinematography is brilliant in depicting the overall uneasiness of the entire movie The use of sound is nothing short of masterful The silence makes you lean in close then the occasional noise makes you lean back Watching a space station be torn to shreds without sound makes you appreciate with your eyes Then spending so much time listening to breathing makes you focus on your own breathing It evokes a sense in yourself that few movies ever reach My only complaint about the movie and I will say this is a fairly minor complaint is that Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock basically has a 90 minute panic attack She never calms down I know that we are supposed to feel what she feels and for the most part we do but personally I doubt that adrenaline would last so long in myself There s not much to say in words about this movie It s visual It s noise It s the lack of noise It s brilliant Go watch it,9
24 April 2020,10 out of 10 without a doubt,What can I say I have watched this movie more than 10 times That s how much I like it The cinematography is phenomenal,10
10 October 2013,Fast moving & fun!!!!!!!!!!,Well worth it Do not be swayed by those who claim this would never happen This isn t a movie based on a true story nor is it a NASA documentary or a premonition of something to come it is entertainment and to that degree a top notch motion picture The editing visual displays and acting are unforgettable and should not be missed particularly in IMAX if possible You come out of this movie before you can truly catch your breath the fast pace and stunning images will mesmerize you and I pray a great many directors and studios follow suit Set the camera and let the story tell itself wonderful Oh yes back to my opening for those who claim all of this is impossible next time do YOUR homework because Alfonso Cuaron DID his research and recent interviews with NASA have verified elements of the movie could or have happened The odds are greatly against all of this happening in conjunction with one another but bear in mind we are talking entertainment here Ham radios CAN be heard in space and the stations are equipped with them just for emergency purposes Space debris CAN and DO hit objects it doesn t happen often but it does YES there are operational manuals on the stations and if can translate them you can control other crafts You CAN access modules and crafts from the outside it has to be set up right but it can be done YES astronauts have communicated with Huston in the blind and are taught to do so when they do not receive responses Now granted this movie happened to throw all the intangibles into a huge crock pot and the story is fascinating to the point we aren t expected to believe it could be duplicated during real missions but WOW what a ride and how thrilling it was to be a part of it,10
12 December 2013,Weightless,Well so much for the credibility of the Golden Globe Awards That was why I decided to watch this movie It received a number of nominations so it must be good right Sadly it was not It was as believable as an episode of Sponge Bob but Bob has more psychological depth than Sandra Bullock s character Actually my bathroom sponge has more psychological depth than Sandra Bullock s character I mean the idea seemed good two people set adrift in space dealing with the inevitability of death and all the angst that that would entail But I knew something was wrong when instead of confronting this sobering reality George Clooney s character begins engaging in cocktail party banter I was baffled I thought that maybe I had been misinformed Maybe this was some kind of black comedy Yes it was a kind of a comedy but regretfully it was only accidentally so Mainly this is a one actress tour de force You ve got to be real good REAL GOOD to pull off an acting role like this Tom Hanks did it in Cast Away but as is now strikingly evident Sandra Bullock is no Tom Hanks In her defense she didn t have much of a script to work with It seemed to be written by a 15 year old And I think the producers realized something was wrong It just didn t have the punch they wanted and I suspect they realized this Inspirational sections were not so you have the inspiring music swelling up in the background Give me a break with this musical prodding that has become so prevalent in recent B movies No amount of dramatic music can replace a bad script with bad acting I won t even go into the physics of being adrift in space I suspect that somewhere NASA scientists are throwing back beers and having great laughs at the movie s expense They were probably the ones who gave it a five star rating Hey you don t suppose they work part time as Golden Globe judges do you,4
31 December 2019,Intense,I didn t think I d like this film But I was kept on the edge of my seat The film just jumped right into the action And nothing was gratuitous Everything was set up to add to the intensity And I felt that I was right there with her with the fear the desperation the hope the determination the frustration the despair that last wild Bullock was great The direction was excellent I was delighted with my experience,10

5 October 2013,"What a Scam , If you saw the trailer you've seen the movie...",What a load I mean what was there was pretty good the graphics and special effects were what the movie was about There was no plot to the story it was simply about being lost in space which is evident in the trailer No character back grounds are given when they had tons of opportunity to tell us about the characters but for some inexplicable reasons they did not They decide to end a 16 00 movie without a beginning or an end I am not sure which An hour and a half movie that was no where near a full movie It clearly was not finished As soon as the lights in the theater came on everyone around us was complaining I heard I want my money back That s it Too short And the best was I think they forgot the rest Clearly this movie lacked substance and a storyline Ultimately if you ve seen the movie trailer you don t need to see the movie There s nothing else you re missing I hope they don t make their money back I think my review was longer than the film,3
25 December 2020,Terrible so stopped prematurely,Effects are great That s it I stopped the dvd around 45 minutes after being irritated since its start Utter idiotic and cheesy typically American drama flick No thx Will watch Married With Children,1
29 November 2017,"Visually great, technically irreproachable, but the script has serious problems.",I watched this movie yesterday or the night before last and frankly I was a bit divided about it I expected something more The script is simple in the near future a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope It s a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth s orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston Sandra Bullock is the main character in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn t well thought Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission There is a latent contradiction here and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture somewhat childish and relaxed prevented me from actually feeling any tension not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely clich The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them This is beautiful and symbolic The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism The technical issue however is beyond reproach CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking I liked cinematography and soundtrack discrete but competent The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic just like the ships tools space suits and even the floating debris Visually the film is powerful and realistic but it s not the first time I say this it s not a CGI storm that makes a good movie The script has to be good And the fact is that the script of this film although it works has a lot of holes errors absurd moments and contradictions No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows the audience has to feel that it s real and it s happening And I could not feel it here,5
14 November 2013,Spectacular Space Movie,This is one of the most spectacular science fiction movies that I have ever seen The story revolves around Mission Specialist Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock on her first space shuttle mission and veteran astronaut Matthew Kowalski George Clooney who are performing repairs on a space telescope when they are struck by debris from a destroyed satellite The views of the Earth from space and the spacecraft themselves are stunningly beautiful and Sandra Bullock gives a fine performance in the central role This is a film that you see less for the story and more for the experience of it so it is definitely best to see it on the biggest screen available and in 3 D if possible I don t even like 3 D much as a rule but in this case it really adds so much to the experience,8
10 October 2020,Falls a little short,Gravity is a well made movie that doesn t quite deliver a worthwhile ending making you wonder what was the point and why did I bother Rather than any great character development awareness or epiphany s SB just floats through space experiencing a bunch of stuff that happened It does have some good moments so there is value just not as much as I wish they could have provided,6

27 February 2014,One of the best,One of the best movies i ve seen in a long time It keeps you on the edge of your seat and continuously amazes you with some of the most beautiful and stunning sights and visual effects you have ever seen I do prefer that you watch it if full 1080p HD quality Definitely one of the most visually stunning movies in the world Some people say that there is Bad Science and I disagree I believe that only at a couple of parts in the movie the laws of physics is completely off If you get a chance to watch Gravity do it especially if you see it in 3D even if you usually hate 3D believe me it s worth it Alfonso Cuar n has outdone himself with this film it s definitely a must see film I give this movie 9 because I believe that the story could be a little better But it is amazing the way it is Also the special and visual effects are amazing I definitely recommend that you watch this movie at least 2 3 times before you die,9

7 October 2013,The most intense film experience of the year.,Gravity is an intense pulse pounding edge of your seat cinematic experience Am I forgetting any movie review clich s Regardless they all apply to this instant classic that redefines the rules for every film about space exploration that has been put to celluloid over the past 50 years Gravity is directed by Alfonso Cuaron whose previous film Children of Men stands among the very best films of the past decade Much like Hitchcock s Rope Cuaron s signature is the use of lengthy single shot sequences The climactic scene from Children of Men is one of the reasons the film is so memorable Cuaron once again expertly uses this technique This time he opens the film with a 13 minute uncut scene as we follow the astronauts while they work on the exterior of the shuttle Cuaron also seamlessly transitions as the camera slowly floats around space as we watch the astronauts to inside Stone s helmet to seeing everything from her perspective The camera work and the use of CGI is pulled off so well that it really gives the illusion as if we are floating in space along with the astronauts There really isn t much to Gravity s plot It s basically a two person Broadway play that takes place in outer space George Clooney plays Matt Kowalski a veteran astronaut who s completing his final space mission Even in the depths of space and all the dangers that accompany it Clooney plays it cool often leisurely floating around without a care in the world like he s taking a stroll in the park Sandra Bullock is his polar opposite She plays Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer embarking on her first space mission Stone is quiet and understandably tense as she navigates around the outside of the space shuttle Bullock s character seems to be wrapped in an orbit of sadness and despair Even in the rare playful scenes between her and Kowalski she seems sullen and her interactions with him feel forced and contrived Soon we realize the reason for Stone s demeanor Some will find her back story a tad heavy handed but I had no problem with it At the start of the film the astronauts are working on the outside of the space shuttle when an unexpected event sends debris hurtling towards them From that point on all hell breaks loose This is where Gravity really starts to shine Cuaron does an amazing job of immersing the viewer in the film He captures the absolute emptiness of space with perfection Gravity also deals with interesting contrasts One moment we feel the suffocating claustrophobia of Stone while she s in her helmet gasping for air and the next instant we are viewing the astronauts as a white speck in the vast expanses of outer space There s also instances of deafening sound and utter silence Early in the film there is a scene that is shot so beautifully that to try and explain it would ruin what makes it so special The most I will say is that it symbolizes rebirth From that moment on Stone is determined to survive This happens to be the main theme of Gravity humanity s sheer animal instinct to survive at all costs Gravity also happens to be the rare film experience that actually uses 3D for the better The use of 3D does a great job of using depth of field to separate the astronauts from the backdrop of Earth Without giving too much away there are numerous scenes that use 3D so perfectly I was so happy I chose to see it in this overused and often misused format The standout performance of Gravity is clearly Sandra Bullock It s her film She captures your attention like James Franco did recently in 127 Hours or like Tom Hanks did in Cast Away 13 years ago Although Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side her work in Gravity will go down as her best Also film buffs with a keen ear might recognize a familiar voice as NASA s mission control I won t spoil the surprise Gravity might be light on plot but if you re looking for a memorable non stop experience then buy a ticket to Gravity sit back and prepare for liftoff,9

18 November 2013,Engrossing!!! Epic!!!,Nobody told that a movie can be so engrossing and yet have so little dialogues or characters In time a time when directors are trying to burden movie goers with twisted convoluted plots and zillions of characters that many people feel the need to go the movies with notebooks comes a game changer from Alfonso Cuaron The story starts with a space walk where Sandra Bullock in a professor who has developed a prototype which is being funded by NASA She is accompanied by George Clooney on a space mission to check her prototype s functionality when catastrophe strikes A sharpen storm of satellite debris destroys there shuttle and leaves them abandoned in space The story them depicts the struggle she faces to get herself back to a pod and get herself back to Earth Words cannot express the performance of Sandra Bullock the way she shows her emotions her inner demons and her struggles as she fights alone thousands of miles above Earth is really a performance to watch A special tribute should also be given to the camera work and all the special effects that more than make up for the lack of dialogues in this movie Overall a game changer of a movie that was worth the wait for me I really wanted to catch on 3D in a theater and abstained myself from renting this one earlier and the worth was totally worth it,9
12 January 2014,Only special effects deserves watching Gravity,I don t know why this movie has caused so much turmoil upheaval It is a boring movie that in several scenes tries to imitate the beautiful 2001 A Space Odyssey It is so improbable and full of errors No doubt the special effects are very good indeed The development of the picture is monotonous has useless dialogue and it could have been more interesting if it had different situations not just the blackness of space for 125 minutes Music is good photography is also good It is a typical Hollywood movie with several situations that are definitively not possible in real life to long to mention here It only deserves the best effects Oscar,2
4 October 2013,Stunning and Spectacular,This movie grabs you by the throat and thrusts you into the action like no other movie in recent memory Never have I felt the sheer terror the utter horror of the events that unfolded on the screen before me as if I were right there experiencing it This is a testament to the fantastic writing and phenomenal direction which let nothing fall through the cracks The claw marks will likely remain upon the seat I occupied for quite some time as I felt like I was holding on for dear life for the entire movie Intense engrossing visually impressive and persistently memorable This is the reason we go to the movies Do not miss this one and if you can see it IMAX 3D it s well worth the pennies,8
23 October 2013,"Wow! Just, wow!",Wow Just wow Let s deal with the negative aspects of Gravity first which are few and almost negligible I was forced into seeing Gravity in 3D It wouldn t have been my choice but that was the format of the screening There are one or two cheep shots bolts flying into the face that are nothing more than gimmickry but to counteract my criticism I haven t seen 3D work this well since Hugo or witnessed the impressive depth of field afforded by 3D since Avatar Secondly George Clooney coasts along in a Doug Ross performance that blends sincerity with a jokey bedside manner However it works Gravity isn t a movie of Oscar winning performances though watch out for the nominations and the clean up at the technical Oscars but of spectacle Astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney is commanding his final space shuttle mission onboard Explorer accompanied by debutant Doctor Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock During a standard spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope they are struck by debris travelling at great speed destroying the shuttle and leaving them spinning in space After watching the trailer I had two thoughts 1 The trailer gave away the entire film and 2 How the heck could co writer director Alfonso Cuar n fill 91 minutes with two people floating in the great beyond It took approximately two minutes to forget my fears and marvel at his achievements Stunning amazing fantastic superb beautiful Pick your superlative All are apt Gravity is a ridiculously tense film that had me close to tears at one point and frequently pushing my feet hard against the floor in a vain attempt to help the astronauts survive Grab it stop for the love of god grab something The digital work is astounding It s like climbing into an ever evolving painting and making it one s own world The sensation of weightlessness is achieved flawlessly through wirework and digital magic Space has never looked so beautiful nor been so devastatingly destructive Every wide shot could be frozen framed and mounted above the fireplace It s not often I am compelled to mention the camera work but the shots here are at times staggeringly good There is one particular fluid shot where the camera sweeps slowly before Ryan s terrified face turning slowly to slide through her helmet and present her point of view before seamlessly retreating along the same arc For this cineaste that was a moment The screenplay is sparse on dialogue in comparison to most big screen offerings but not a single word is wasted Co written with his son Jon s Cuar n s screenplay is at times gently amusing and often taut with clipped utterances Like oxygen supplies in space words are not to be squandered The visual feast before us tells us more than the dialogue and Steven Price s magnificent atmospheric score completes the experience as strikingly as the elongated silences With all the ingredients blended Gravity is ridiculously tense It almost hurts to watch it but it demands repeated viewings and my second will be tonight Though there are peripheral characters notably Ed Harris as the voice of Mission Control just one of many references to space and sci fi flicks gone by Gravity is a film of two actors who are frequently isolated on the screen Clooney is a natural formidable presence If one were lost in space and facing possible death 940 000 miles from home his Matt Kowalski would be high on the wish list of companions in doom Largely a vocal performance it s difficult to see much of him behind the helmet his performance is a tangible aspect in a situation we could never fully appreciate He leaves us in no doubt as to the urgency of their predicament while refusing to carry a scythe and read the last rites Matt is the astronaut equivalent of a surgeon finding the humorous benefit of weight loss via amputation Sandra Bullock has never been better Not even when earning her Oscar for The Blind Side No she may not strike double gold with Ryan but what on earth is she doing trudging through bilge like The Heat when she is capable of this It is very difficult to carry a film as frequently the lone performer with no one to bounce off but Bullock s performance is beautifully controlled and profoundly affecting Perhaps the backstory is a little contrived but that is not her fault and more to the point it makes Ryan human and allows the events to unfold as they do Watching Bullock in Gravity one wonders if we have seen the birth of a career butterfly finally emerging after 25 years from a comfortable chrysalis Maybe I m going soft maybe I m hormonal or perhaps I ve just been lucky this past three weeks and seen three fantastic films after The Kings of Summer and Captain Phillips but Gravity is stunning I emerged from the screening drained and I have to see it again On a slight tangent earlier this week a certain BBC presenter referred to Gravity as this year s Life of Pi My heart sank as I thought he implied that none of it had actually happened and that perhaps Ryan would awake to find herself at peace in another place with it all having been in her mind For those who heard the same report fear not The comparison comes from Matt and Ryan being shipwrecked albeit in space and the phenomenal special effects There is a crash they are floating in space and Gravity is nothing short of an exquisite film With all the eloquence I can muster wow,10

18 September 2018,Astonishing piece of space,Less is more In the face of infinite space Gravity made me incredibly grateful for having some ground under my feet and enough oxygen around my head The plot is straight and clear and in the thrilling finale every milisecond felt as eternity Sandra Bullock performs standardly well Clooney too And the visuals the cinematography the level of technical details accuracy and the divine music It took me some time to pick my jaw from the floor Astonishing movie,9

23 October 2013,Amazing from beginning to end!,GRAVITY When I found out that I managed to get tickets to a preview screening of Gravity I was so happy I have been waiting for this film for ages Ever since I saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see it I thought the trailer looked amazing So there I was sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start 3D glasses on and thinking to myself I really hope this does not disappoint I had the same feeling about Open Water The trailer for that looked good it had the potential to be a good film but when I watched it I was so disappointed I thought it was very boring and felt let down I didn t want that feeling again so I tend not to get too excited about a film but with this I could not help it Thankfully this film was amazing Far better than I thought it was going to be The film is about a group of astronauts that are in space fixing a satellite All of a sudden there are reports of a missile destroying another satellite and the debris is heading towards the astronauts Their ship get s hit badly and they have to fight to survive being stranded free floating in space The story is so gripping It has been a very long time since a film has had me glued and worried about the characters as much as this I spent the whole film so tense I could not relax at all I even found myself holding my breath a couple of times too You really find yourself getting into it You don t really know the characters before everything kicks off but that doesn t matter There is no time to introduce the characters as it is pretty much action from the start You grow to like these characters a lot and all the way through I had no idea if they would survive or not I like this because it was an original story Yes there have been other space disaster movies but this felt completely different than anything I had seen before The casting was perfect Sandra Bullock takes the lead role She was really good and convincing I always said she was better in serious roles and this is in my opinion the best film she has ever made There are talks of her getting nominated for an Oscar for this I think she deserves it It was also really good that Sandra made this film with no make up on at all It made it feel more realistic It is a brave move really for a big Hollywood actress to be seen on screen without anything to make her look made up George Clooney was the other main character He did a fantastic job also You really like his character He has a laid back more relaxed attitude in space just cruising around with his jet pack on But he seems to be the character that takes charge I think he should get some good recognition for this too The film was shot really well Space looked amazing The film was visually beautiful There were so many shots where I was wishing I was up there As a photographer I would love to be taking photos of those views The other thing I really liked about this movie was the soundtrack The music was very well put together and made the 0065perience even more tense I also loved the fact that when there was an explosion in space or a crash you heard nothing but the music In space there are no sounds so it is great that this film kept it real If I was to say anything negative about this film I would have to say that the 3D could have been better It was really good in places but in other places it was not very good There were a few places where you could see there were bits that were meant to come out but didn t really But this did not ruin the movie too much I am also thinking that if I watched this in 2D it would be a bit weird because a couple of times you could see it was made for 3D It might look a bit out of place in 2D But it shouldn t ruin the film too much This film is one that has to be seen in the cinema in 3D watch it in IMAX if you can you will not regret it I loved this movie and will give it 9 out of 10 No no no Houston don t be anxious Anxiety is bad for the heart For more reviews please like my Facebook page  www facebook com pages Ordinary Person Movie Reviews 456572047728204 ref hl,9

15 December 2016,what a brave man,Academy Awards USA 2014 win and 222 other wins and 169 nominations this movie is just got much achievement i just watch to know why it got a lot s of award and after watching it watching cum feeling it some astronauts in space got trouble and struggling to return in earth and only one lady did in last but there was man i think the man is just something beyond how can somebody control himself like he is controlling he is all time talking funny when they are in trouble he still talk funny he is very near to death but he just didn t stop it what a man no one can do it like that and when i was watching i just trying to feel it so whenever in space they just moving here and there for a moment they just quit spaceship and not holding anything mean they are totally free my heartbeat increase like if they just miss one time to hold a part of ship his life just gone because that s space you can t stop you you can t run you they just push himself with a force so they can reach to another short distance place where they want to go but when the trouble is involved they can t even bind himself by a rope and that brave man just give his life for that woman so she probably can reach in earth and she did it in last however she quit hope in between and letting her die but then she think about that man what will he do and she just did it and when she just reach in earth and just lie in floor and don t wanna too stand she is just feeling how happy she is when you just escape death what a moment don t watch this movie probably you will not like just feel it feel the fear of death that they guys are facing and being astronaut is so difficult you just go in space like a death mission no one can 100 sure that they will return safe,10
21 October 2013,Hang On,We always carry certain fears within our subconscious every day the possibility that may be we left the stove on coffee maker on didn t lock the door lost our homework or any other worst case scenario you can think of These are things that rarely and don t usual happen to most to all people But there is always that looming dread that it still can and the dark truth is sometimes it actually does This is one of the best suspense films I ve ever seen because this is a worst case scenario that takes place in space Which I think is really cool because most suspense thrillers are always earth based It s an uncomplicated and simple plot which makes this all the better personally I getting kinda bored of most thrillers trying to be too complicated for their own good all thought but no thrills And the plot feels plausible whose to say this can t happen The effects are just fantastic I really love how space looks in this film it really looks like real space And it s all reinforced by some of the excellent cinematography I really love how it weaved around in certain places gave everything almost a certain sense of geography Even at times there was some first person perspective shots which really gave a great sense of being in the astronaut s point of view but most importantly helped really put you in the action And they also created the illusion of gravity well the physical chirography and visual effects were on the mark that you d almost think the film really was shot up in space because they really nailed the physics of space perfectly Even the score was excellent it was thrilling and epic On further note I saw this film in 3D and the 3D in this film is just fantastic it really gave you the illusion that you were up there and in on the action at times when the debris came I couldn t help but duck in my seat it looked like they were coming at me But most importantly the suspense in the film was excellent This film goes at a fast pace things are just constantly happening that there s almost no time to take a breath The acting is solid George Clooney does well with what he has but to me it was really Sandra Bullock that drove this film let alone she is the main protagonist I really liked both her emotional and physical performance how her character reacts in the film it felt like how anyone else might react and feel if even in this type of uncontrollable situation constantly trying to keep functioning and working despite losing most of your cool I ll admit I couldn t help but worry for her life as both time and physics were against her As at times she has to get from point A to B safely without loosing control of her body Or even simply trying to get hit or knocked away from the debris that zip as fast as bullets and can cut through things like razors Just any other obstacle that makes things worse than they already are as a saying goes out of the frying pan into the fire Gravity is a thrill ride worth hanging on to Rating 4 stars,10

5 October 2013,One Incredible Lost-in-Space Adventure,Gravity tells of the unenviable situation experienced by medical researcher Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and her astronaut mission leader Matt Kowalski George Clooney when an accidental disaster caused by a shower of satellite debris destroys their space station and leaves them floating in deep space Director Alfonso Cuaron has created a masterpiece that knows when to move for excitement and when to stop for meditation We enjoy the breathtaking ride through the dangerous outer frontiers We also get to look inwards to the essence of our own minuscule humanity in stark contrast to the vastness of the universe We will feel agoraphobia and claustrophobia at the same time while Stone and Kowalski struggle to keep themselves alive Gravity is not much of a story to be told by mere words but a story that needs to be experienced best via the medium of film and all its modern abilities This film employs the best of cinematographic technique Emmanuel Lubezki editing efficiency Cuaron himself and Mark Sanger top of the line 3D visual and eerie sound effects to re create the harshness of outer space The musical score by Stephen Price can be both soaring and quiet when the scene called for it I truly see ALL the technical Oscars going to this fantastic technical team There maybe some scientific principles amiss as some incredible coincidences arise to move the story forward However we so care so much for our two characters that these minor details done in the name of artistic license can be overlooked with no big deal The film successfully makes us feel emotionally connected with them We are out there with them and we want to escape this scary and hopeless situation with them Sandra Bullock comes up with a precious performance of a lonely person desperately confronting the biggest fears of her life in the bleakest of situations ever Her range of emotions ran the gamut from fearful despair to hopeful determination She is front center and everything this movie is about She did not lose her sense of humor when we also needed it This has got to be a Best Actress performance of the highest merit Supporting Bullock is George Clooney as that believable voice of calm and reassurance we all need With him there Ryan felt she can overcome any adversity she faced His wit and charm carried Ryan through her ordeal and this was palpable enough to carry the whole audience along the ride with her Gravity might as well be declared the Best Picture of this award season already As of now it can already be considered a lock for the big prize because of its audacity of scope its technical excellence its memorable performances and above all its images full of artistry and symbolism 10 10,10
2 December 2013,The best 156 shots you'll ever see!,Gravity is a technical and directorial tour de force from Alfonso Cuar n sure to win some Oscars Sandra Bullock almost single handily carries the film with an excellent screen performance The technical complexity of this film which spent 4 years in development because technology wasn t advanced enough is quite mind boggling The opening shot is one continuous 17 min shot and the whole film is comprised of only 156 shots Despite this low shot count there is plenty of complex camera movement The visual effects are also very realistic and some of those VFX shots will go down in history as some of the most impressive ever seen The 3D effect which in some movies doesn t work at all works very well here This really is a film which you HAVE to see in the cinema if only for those space shots of the astronauts above our big blue planet A very highly recommended masterpiece,9
6 October 2013,A modern masterpiece,Gravity is a film I ve been looking forward to for a ridiculously long amount of time It s essentially about two astronauts who struggle for survival after floating debris collides with their spaceship leaving them detached and adrift in space It s not so much sci fi as it is drama thriller and when I say thriller I don t mean that lightly It was literally the most stressful 90 minutes of my life but I was in awe of every second of it Cuar n who directed co wrote produced and even helped edit the film hasn t done a full length feature since 2006 s bitingly poignant Children of Men but Gravity was well worth the wait It s one of the best directed films I ve ever seen Cuar n s use of incredibly long takes sucks the viewer in so that they physically cannot turn away The film starts out with a 17 minute shot no editing no cuts It s just the camera moving from one subject to another in and out close up and far away all over the place really Space is limitless and so is Cuar n It s tough to appreciate just how masterful this film is until you see it for yourself Being set miles above earth s surface every single take is absolutely gorgeous The visuals are stunning and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the best work I ve ever seen with Steven Price s electric and ethereal score only adding to the tense atmosphere The earth itself turns into a character and it s used brilliantly all the way up until the very end As for the performances well there are really only two significant roles George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut out on his last mission and serves as a form of moral support to Sandra Bullock s character Dr Ryan Stone who s up on her very first mission Clooney does a fine job and is an integral part of the plot line but it s Bullock who utterly dominates the screen time giving a fearless and absorbing performance like never before It s by far the best work of her career Dr Stone is so real that it s scary You laugh when she laughs you cry when she cries and you re breathless as she s struggling for air The emotions that Cuar n was able to elicit from her truly pull you into the film and make this an experience like no other While the script isn t necessarily the best written and most certainly skims the line of oversentimentality at times those issues are secondary to the visuals and performances themselves It s truly an out of body experience and probably the closet most of us will ever get to actually being in space,9
15 November 2013,The perils of space travel,Gravity was one of the anticipated films of 2013 and for good reason it was the return of Alfonso Cuaron in the director s chair after a seven year break Orbiting the Earth is the Explorer Space Shuttle is orbiting the world when space debris destroying the shuttle and leaving only two survivors Lt Matt Kowalski a veteran on his last mission and Dr Ryan Stone a mission specialist on her first mission Stranded in the middle of space the pair try to make it to the International Space Station as their oxygen and fuel is running low as the debris speeds around the world every 90 minutes Gravity is a film that gets everything right a tort script fantastic visuals and great performances from Bullock and Clooney Cuaron really does give us a visual extravaganza showing the beauty of space and the world with the depths of space and the zero gravity enhanced by 3D effects some of the best put to film Curaron continues his use of long takes and tracking shoots which I am a sucker for and due to the space setting there was no limitation and helped keep the flow of the acting Gravity tells a simple story but it is beautifully told Cuaron is able to make the film compelling thrilling film as we follow the astronauts in their struggle and we get to find out about them during the film Dr Stone grows from a woman who was already nervous about her mission to someone who has to grow as she fights for survival Despite the simple story Cuaron was able to add style toughs with looks of religious icons adding subtext to the film Cuaron gets the tone right throughout film from when to be exciting with the full force of the special effects and when to be more tender or tragic and the very occasional moments of humour all increased by Bullock s performance It was very reminiscence to Duncan Jones Moon Steve Price also supplies a fantastic score for the film and it is one of the best of the year Gravity is an excellent film working on the story and characters to visual spender and gripping action spectacle as it shares themes of the perils of space travel to Moon Sunshine and Apollo 13,9
18 October 2013,I haven't seen a more engaging film all year.,The essence of a film lies in its ability to astonish us beyond what we imagine to be possible or impossible Every year just a handful of films manage to do this by leaving us in a state of awe and euphoria For 2013 this is it GRAVITY is a state of the art film that you experience rather than just watch on a big screen And years from now it will be remembered for setting new benchmarks in the filmmaking industry Cinematically speaking this is not just my best movie of the year by the manner in which it is made or narrated but because of the way it will change the world of motion pictures as we know it Last year it was Ang Lee s LIFE OF PI and few years ago it was James Cameron s AVATAR While the common thread running through these films are generous eye popping visual effects GRAVITY is far more superior in style soul effects and showmanship That being said there isn t much of a story here and like LIFE OF PI before the central theme is a white knuckle do or die survival story But that s where the comparison ends The opening scene is an unbroken 15 minute long take that introduces us to veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky George Clooney and Mission Specialist Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock as they repair the Hubble telescope 600 kilometers above Earth Matt is commanding his final space mission while Ryan is on her first They joke around a bit converse with mission control in Houston voiced by Ed Harris and a third astronaut working in the background Then comes the dreaded abort after Houston warns that debris from a missile hit Russian satellite is headed their way At speeds nearing 20 000 kilometers an hour this debris becomes shrapnel that rips through their space shuttle simultaneously killing the crew and severing communications with Houston Barely surviving the hit Matt and Ryan are now tiny white dots against the black expanse of outer space And that s not even the bad news Low on oxygen and tumbling through hostile conditions of space their only hope of survival is reaching the International Space Station before the aforementioned debris returns within orbital striking distance Matt estimates they have 90 minutes to get to the space station Incidentally this is also the runtime of the film where everything happens in real time proximity All through this runtime Mexican director Alfonso Cuar n maintains a visceral deadlock between the viewer s state of awe and the terrifying ordeal playing out on screen But even against increasing panic shortness of breath and imminent death the narrative switches to a frantic fight for survival by clinging on to mankind s most innate virtues hope Bullock embodies this in the role of a lifetime by constantly allowing her character to evolve At first she is a rookie medical engineer on her first space mission then a terrified individual with a tragic past before learning to tap into the essence of the human spirit Bullock has come a long way from driving a bus in SPEED to sidelining excuse the pun the competition in her Oscar winning THE BLIND SIDE to flying an entire space station in this film THIS is Sandra Bullock at her finest and every iota of her portrayal demands another Academy Award nomination Close behind but with less screen time is Clooney Equipped with witticisms and pep Clooney is exactly what you would expect from and actor director with a thoroughbred resume For most of us GRAVITY is the closest we will ever get to feeling what it must be like in space This is Cuar n s gift to the cinema industry and the discerning audience alike Having co scripted the film with his son Cuar n s greatest achievement in this film is the technical nuance that has gone into its making Cinematography is literally out of this world with some of the most spectacular vistas of Earth There are scenes where the lens shifts from infinite space to within an inch of Ryan s face a seamless juxtaposition of the vastness of space with claustrophobia Sound design accentuated by Steven Price s original score is another contrast between surreal imagery and the eerie loneliness of space These are not just effects in the conventional sense but a profound manner of grafting special effects with the character s emotions and the darkening atmosphere of the narrative all in 3D that is not only immersive but in a way that becomes the skeletal binding of the story Phenomenal As an only perceivable flaw GRAVITY can seem preachy at times underscored by slim propaganda that says something about the selfless courage of the elite men and women who risk life and limb for the greater good of humanity Then again such was the message in last year s Academy Award Best Picture ARGO At the time of writing this review awards season 2014 is still a few months away But from where I was seated I am looking at no less than nominations for sound design visual effects cinematography best leading actress directing and quite possibly Best Motion Picture And then some,9
29 August 2016,GRAVITY....You Don't SEE It....But You Sure as Heaven EXPERIENCE It!,Long Live Alfonso Cuaron Que Viva Alfonso Cuaron In just a few hundred words I will now try to do the film its director and cast Sandra Bullock George Clooney justice The Seventh Art is a term that seems to have fallen into disuse during the past 15 or 20 years GRAVITY s director Alfonso Cuaron Children of Men has not only resuscitated but also reinvented it adding a signature spin all his own Where is it written that a movie s commercial success is almost always inversely proportionate to its artistic intellectual and aesthetic quality GRAVITY most certainly brings to mind the adage The exception proves the rule As this review is being written Gravity is rated 8 5 on IMDb com by 184 000 placing it in the all time film top 75 just behind The LION KING and just ahead of REQUIEM FOR a DREAM Truly great films are both original and work on multiple levels How specifically does this one manage so much in just 90 minutes Alfonso Cuaron s poetic visuals enable us to view his reality through the eyes of a cinematic genius A glimmering tear floating aimlessly impacts the viewer with a Tsunami of emotion The breathtaking yet surreal backdrop of hovering earth and stars provides an ever present reminder of both our relative insignificance on a cosmic scale and the fleetingness of our problems however transcendent they may seem to us in the moment GRAVITY communicates more via imagery and resourceful subtle yet intense acting than it does through dialog The dialog here mostly serves as a buffer a veneer to calm and disguise extremely turbulent inner emotions Some of life s great tragedies are framed in the most insipid of words There is genuinely something for everyone here If gut wrenching is what you seek there are some chaotic frenetic and viscerally charged moments Almost forgot to mention GRAVITY s use of 3 D is never over the top in your face nor employed gratuitously It is deftly and strategically used to highlight on screen occurrences not to detract from them or be the sole focus per se Bullock s character Dr Stone who at first seems utterly driven to achieve perfection is in reality locked into a self induced drone like state of professional isolation resulting from a profound loss she seemingly refuses to come to terms with The inner conflict this causes her and Bullock s ability to involve the audience in her character s catharsis translates into moments of overwhelming poignancy Why is her performance Oscar worthy Ms Bullock literally carries the entire last half of the movie solely on her shoulders and her performance is tersely awe inspiring Very few Hollywood actresses could pull this off And to think that initially she wasn t on the short list for the role George Clooney s character larger than life veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski is the jovial kind of guy who can be a bit of an hole at times but amazes you with his simple selfless professionalism when it really counts In this supporting role the on screen platonic chemistry with Sandra Bullock is uncanny Honestly some of the best I have ever seen Lastly in addition to gut grabbing heart involving and mentally engaging Gravity does what only 1 film in a 1 000 manages It captures your soul Some really fine films try to provide the right answers After experiencing GRAVITY you ll be asking yourself many of the right questions ENJOY DISFRUTELA Any comments questions or observations in English o en Espa ol are most welcome,10

12 October 2013,Everything you heard about this space thriller is true – it is a great piece of cinematic work,If you have been reading movie new and reviews online you d probably know by now how everyone is raving about the greatness of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron s latest work This review will tell you the same thing but instead of gushing about visually stunning it is from the on start let s begin by discussing how this writer is actually impressed with female lead Sandra Bullock s performance for once Don t get him wrong this columnist has nothing against the Academy Award winner His first encounter with the 49 year old actress was in 1994 s Speed but as anyone would kindly remind you the attention was on a certain Keanu Reeves The actress then went on to make a name in movies like Miss Congeniality 2000 Crash 2004 and The Lake House 2006 She finally won an Oscar for her role in The Blind Side 2009 which with no offence intended isn t a particularly outstanding performance at least in this humble writer s opinion It is with this space thriller that this reviewer is convinced that Bullock is a credible actress She plays a medical engineer on her first outer space mission with a veteran astronaut The first shuttle mission goes amok when a seemingly routine spacewalk becomes a disaster leaving the shuttle destroyed and the two of them completely stranded and alone in outer space You d wonder how much acting can Bullock showcase when she s in a space suit most of the time Some clever scriptwriting will actually have her character out of the suit in a body fitting tank top no less and impressing with her personable and surprisingly poignant performance as a grieving mother whose life is on a brink We will not be surprised if she picks up acting nominations during the upcoming award season There s nothing like giving recognition to the actress who has been working hard in showbiz starring in a hyped up film like this Enough about Bullock for now so what s in it for viewers who are interested in to put simply a good movie Lots apparently You may have heard how this is the best space movie ever made how this will leave you terrified and awed at the same time and how it immerses you in an unforgettable viewing experience Truth is the statements are all spot on Without sounding like a fan boy we ll encourage you to experience this movie yourself Although we didn t watch the film in IMAX3D format we can assume it will be one memorable 91 minute movie you actually won t mind spending a few extra bucks on Does Cuaron s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Children of Men cinematic masterpiece have emotionally affecting moments While movies with characters reflecting on life whilst staring at death in the face are aplenty this one works probably due to the commendable performance by the leads Yup there is another cast member acting alongside Bullock and he comes in the form of the irresistible George Clooney While he plays a supporting character you cannot deny the actor s screen presence His every line in the movie will leave you assured that he is one dude you d want at your party And oh do watch out for the sequence with floating tear drops Trust us they are even more awesome in 3D,9

1 January 2014,"bad movie, neglecting the reality",I can t understand why such a huge popularity when this movie has little to do with the reality There are many wrongs let me just count few ISS orbits Earth in 45min so debris at the same orbital hight could not hit it every 90 min Hubble telescope and ISS are not on the same altitude and do not have same velocity Transffering yourself form on position to another takes a space vehicle and advanced planing debris traveling at speed of 10 times more than a bullet could not been see astronauts can t take off a space suite They need to spent up to 3 hours in decompression chamber since they breathe pure oxygen at partial pressure while on ISS there is an air mixture much like on Earth but at a bit lower pressure than on Earth Also taking a space suite off after decompression is a 3 man job and it take much more than a few seconds and under the suite you wear cooling suite and an adult diaper There is no way to operate Chinese space module if you are not familiar with it I also doubt that Sandra could be an astronaut since she shows claustrophobia and she makes stupid screams like she s having an intense orgasm Chinese station would not fell on Earth by itself Someone will need to slow down the object to lose altitude and finally enters the Eart s atmosphere Durring the atmospheric reentry you feel a strong force of braking so the object wouldn t just float,2

4 October 2013,Cinematic Brilliance,When I see a truly great movie it leaves me speechless There s so much going through my mind Because a great film is one that can t be taken at face value it inspires thought and leaves an imprint on you At it s surface Gravity is a Hollywood popcorn movie about survival in space during a horrific accident but underneath it and most importantly it is a film about the human experience From it s wonderfully entrancing opening shot Director Alfonso Cuaron immerses you in the environment of space It s the closest experience many of us will get to actual space travel We meet our central characters executing their assigned tasks and goofing off a bit and than they get an emergency message that debris from a damaged satellite is heading towards them It strikes with no sound because there is no sound in space it s a truly nightmarish sequence that leads to some of the most horrifying moments you ve ever seen on screen The film is a tour de force from beginning to end A monumental technical achievement terrifyingly beautiful but what makes this film so successful is in the way the heavy effects that drive the film blend with it s emotional core making for a truly engaging experience When Sandra Bullock sheds her suit and floats in a fetal position you can feel the subtext of rebirth as well as finding the will to survive and echoes of that in the films conclusion Gravity is a film about death but it s also a film about life and loss and the will to survive not just in the events that are happening on screen but everything that happens to us on a day to day basis Director Alfonso Cuaron a master film maker directs the film with an eerie simplicity challenging us with nearly unbearable tension and delving deeper into something truly spiritual George Clooney leaves a charismatic imprint in a small but important role and the central performance by Sandra Bullock is truly remarkable and quite possibly the best of her dramatic career She s a definite shoe in for a best performance nod and anyone going against her will have a hard run of it The movie flows like liquid cinematic poetry covering every inch with cinematic brilliance Gravity isn t just one of the best films I ve ever seen it s an amazing experience 5,10
23 May 2014,A Perfect Combination of Thrill Ride and Meaningful Message,I can t understand why so many people rate this movie so low This is a precious film I don t care if it s not accurate in terms of facts in physics or spacecraft knowledge But while I was watching it I felt like I was being put into the space and experience how it feels and how difficulty life can be for human when we are without gravity how the earth is beautiful and created just perfectly to be our home I don t think the point of the movie is to make a perfect scientific film It has a much deeper meaning about human being and our place in the universe It also has a theme about not giving up stop dwelling in the despair and give life everything you have although you don t know if you will make it to the destination Not matter how it turns out life is one hell of a ride It is a film with a spiritual message particularly that scene that makes the main character get back her courage and her will to live Some people think that the scene is ridiculous but to me it s so beautiful and carries a very good meaning I love it And I also love the way they put the belief about afterlife into it not much but just enough to make this film precious and worth more than the whole crap of non sense scientific film from Hollywood today Watching this film I gain back my courage and the will to live and I ll try to be thankful for every moment of life and for the earth that we are living in Besides I think it is smart that the film uses only a very small cast and put most effort into special effect creating a fascinating picture of what is like to be out in the space and be without gravity making it look so real The storyline is good I enjoy the thrill ride from the beginning to the end It was a very entertaining film to me as well I give it a score of ten just to balance out those who give it one,10
7 October 2013,A virtual masterpiece of suspense as two stranded astronauts fight to survive.,Gravity isn t just a good film it is a great film I have been watching movies for well over 4 decades and this might have been one of the most emotionally harrowing film experiences I have ever had I rarely use the word masterpiece but if this isn t one it s damn close and as close to a perfect movie as I ve seen in a long time Gravity s story is simple a crew of 5 astronauts in the space shuttle Explorer are working on additions to the Hubble Telescope Mid mission they receive news that the Russians have destroyed one of their own satellites with a missile test and debris has been sent rocketing close to their proximity news which becomes a dire warning as the satellite debris has impacted other satellites and now a cloud of wreckage is heading right for them at an increasing velocity and they have moments to abort their mission and get out of harm s way Despite their efforts to get out of danger the debris hits them full on and only Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney who is on his last mission are left alive tethered together with with Kowalski s jet propulsion pack running out of power and Stone running out of air Can they reach the International Space Station and before the cloud of debris orbits Earth and returns And if they do are they even safe there Co written with Jon s Cuar n and directed by Alfonso Cuar n Gravity is 90 minutes of one of the most emotionally gripping and suspenseful movie going experiences you re likely to have as he quickly establishes two very likable human beings who are put in one of the most frightening scenarios one can imagine Cuar n not only gives us two people to root and care for but his masterful camera work and the flawless SPFX create a vast and frightening void that is as beautiful as it is intimidating One false move and you can be lost in the vast empty coldness and with no air and no one coming to your rescue Cuar n uses a lot of POV and stunning camera shots to put us in space right there with our two stranded astronauts and we experience what they do and feel their fear every step of the way Not to mention that the Children Of Men filmmaker gets two Oscar worthy performances out of Clooney and Bullock and these veteran actors create two very endearing three dimensional characters we embrace all the way and are right along with in experiencing every heartbreaking setback and grasping every glimmer of hope The film is truly an emotional roller coaster ride that most movies promise but few can actually deliver By the time the credits rolled I felt I had been through everything the characters had and thanks to Cuar n s skillful directing and wonderful script I had An exhilarating harrowing and wonderfully suspenseful movie that is more then just a film it s an experience A must see movie Best film of year for me and doubt I will see anything as powerful for some time,10

15 October 2013,3D vs. Plot,In my opinion 3D represents the package of the plot so if you want to make a good movie first of all you must take a good plot and wrap it in a beautiful 3D package Unfortunately almost every 3D movie being made these days by the big production companies are bulls ts wrapped in outstanding packages For a clear view of the quality of a movie first you must see it in 2D and if it s good then you go to see it in 3D like I did with Life of Pi for example After reading so many reviews I figured it out that there are two kinds of peoples the stupid mindless people products of the consumer society for whom the package is the most important thing no matter what s in it and the people who are not too lazy to use their brains and who are disgusted of such a huge amount of mediocrity they try to sell us telling us through the voice of the critics paid by them that they are masterpieces The fist kind is the majority so they will make more stupid movies for stupid people s money I could and I will use this review for almost all the 3D movies they made since 2009 s Avatar which by the way in my opinion it s a decent movie I saw it only in 2D,1

7 June 2014,Overrated gravity,A couple of months after the Oscar I still can t believe it how this film managed to get 7 statues Also the fact that Sandra Bullock was nominated for her role is shocking Good that nowadays not everyone is taking Oscars as a reference The plot is so poor and all this Sci Fi part is based only on the fact that the action is in space The so called performance of Sandra Bullock is dreadful Being a novice her role is stuffed with lines aiming to be funny along with similar situations when she s building her plan The maximum is when she s hitting randomly the buttons of the space shuttle trying to start the engine Overall she was unconvincing and considering how this part was created I was more than surprised when she was nominated I would say that Gravity was a big deception and is one of the most overrated films in recent time,1
1 May 2014,Not believable at all,If you can switch off your common sense and just look at the visuals then you can maybe massively enjoy this adventure preferably on a big screen 3D was nice too But it made me kind of sad that it wasn t remotely believable People tend to think it s only a movie take it for what it is Yes but even Star Wars needs to be believable within its own universe and it is Even James Bond most of the time A movie like Gravity cannot take short cuts on the laws of physics To illustrate my point My 10 year old son pointed out to me halfway through what I had noticed all the way that things didn t make sense Minor SPOILER to follow Like when Clooney and Bullock is hanging by some wires like there are gravity involved or like they are dragged behind the space station in motion Eh One of them even bouncing back and the other falling or was that wind because they were too close to the atmosphere It sure didn t look that way If the idea here was to develop the story then there are so many ways it could be done so much more believable It s like the film makers think sure they wont notice Well we do I gave it 6 10 just because of the visuals and the overall feeling drifting around in orbit despite awful dialog despite Bullock and the physics going mentally insane,5

10 October 2014,Basically its a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals is just okay.,Yes this has absolutely stunning special effects in fact I ve never seen anything quite like it How the hell did they film this anyways Its also claustrophobia inducing and a hell of a thrill ride yet despite all that Gravity just didn t do it for me Now I can t claim to know anything about physics but it all just seemed far fetched to me so that basically what you ve got here is a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals is just okay Gravity reminded me of Apollo 13 in that everything that could go wrong does for astronaut Sandra Bullock who is having the worst day ever George Clooney is just being George Clooney he s barely in the movie a space cowboy playing the same character he is in all of his other movies Charming flirty heroic in a humble way He was this guy on ER like a hundred years ago Anyways I m sure if I d seen this in the theatre I would have given it a higher rating as that s how its meant to be seen but that would still be based on the special effects not the story or the acting or the gratuitous floating underwear scene Still I don t regret watching it the effects are game changing and it must have been gruelling for the actors to film The ending also left things a little vague Where was Sandra 5 10 14,5
3 January 2014,"Well Crafted, but Really Hard to Believe",First of all special effects are first rate acting pretty good and decent suspense It s a likable movie that deals in scientific realities and events that could happen Like so many films that are of this genre we have to look at the likelihood of a single person being able to accomplish what she does Just the punishment she takes would be enough to squash most mortals She is smashed against bulkheads caught in webs of detritus oxygen starved burned and frozen but never into submission I guess I can t criticize her surviving since in the story she does There is also her ability to adapt to a setting a Russian space ship where she seems to know an awful lot Granted she is an astronaut but her ability to adapt is beyond the pale All that said it s a thrill a minute science fiction thriller with two charismatic actors a bit of the supernatural as well I left exhausted and somewhat satisfied but when I thought about the whole of it I realized it wasn t a great movie,7
15 October 2013,Don't understand the hype!,A friend described Sandra Bullock s moaning and gasping in a good portion of the film as sounding like bad sex This was just a bad movie with no realism and really no suspense the whole thing just wasn t believable How Sandra Bullock s character was not screened out of the space program due to her emotional problems caused by the sudden death of her four year old child cannot be explained George Clooney s character was a modern day Don Juan apparently the only role Clooney is comfortable portraying and is about as realistic as Johnny Depp s role as Tonto in The Lone Ranger Putting the make on a fellow astronaut during a life threatening situation is only credible to Hollywood Sadly this kind of fluff in now de rigueur in today s world of film production,2
27 October 2013,MADE FOR IMAX 3D!! The most incredible visual sense of floating in space.,This is one of those very rare movies like Jurassic Park that were MADE for the BIG screen From beginning to end the excellent 3D effects are amazing and nearly constant The majority of the movie is floating in space outside of the spacecraft with a few minutes inside now and then Things are always floating around and there is a lot of depth and amazing views of the Earth stars spacecraft etc giving you an incredible visual sense of being in space The story is pretty good but not the perfect edge of your seat story e g Aliens If you re hoping for a Clooney Bullock romance or chemistry it s not there They are coworkers trying to survive These are the reasons for losing one star but the 3D experience in IMAX should earn it an extra 5 stars No other sci fi movie I ve ever seen has given such a realistic visual sense of being in space If you read this review before Gravity leaves IMAX 3D theaters go see it NOW it s worth the extra money for IMAX to be engulfed by it If it has already ended its run in IMAX 3D I guess you ll have to settle for Blu ray sitting a meter from the highest quality 100 in 3D TV and a room shaking stereo system if you or a friend have one,9
20 January 2014,Great CGI...that's it...,Gravity is possibly the most overrated movie I ve watched in recent years Yes it has great CGI the visuals are stunning but I think I payed for a movie This has absolutely no plot no character development no story And an Oscar nomination for Sandra Bullock to look scared and breath heavily are you serious The above is fair warning to those like me who think that are going to watch a movie You re going to watch something that would be a great space documentary If you wanna be blow away with stunning visuals this is for you The best CGI I ve seen to this day the attention to detail in every little thing and it really takes you somewhere if you watch it in 3D it looks like you re in the middle of the action That being said it is an experience but not a movie experience It would be something to try in Disneyland or some amusement park because it is a ride It s just not a movie It is impossible for me to spoil it because it has no plot to spoil I can t tell you anything you don t already know going in I give it a 6 10 because I kinda enjoyed the ride and it deserves credit for its visuals but this is by far 2013 most overrated movie,6

14 October 2013,Not Since Alien has a film in space been this heart pounding,Gravity is a heart pumping claustrophobic scif fi thriller from maverick director Alfonso Curan The film s leads George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give Oscar worthy performance as astronauts on a routine mission that quickly goes haywire The film is enchanting in its visual effects giving the audience a first hand view of what space is really like The sounds are soft and drowned in space the land vast and open it is a truly terrifying film as it uses extremely long takes and masterful camera work to give the audience the most realistic space experience in 3D The scenes usually are focused on Sandra Bullock s character Ryan Stone giving the audience a first hand experience of what it would really be like if someone was lost in space Bullock s performance is nuanced as she demonstrates fear and panic in the most realistic light everything from her heavy breathing to her moments of complete hopelessness is portrayed in the most expert of ways It is truly a fantastic performance There are many words that can articulate the experience of Gravity but in all actuality it will not do this film experience justice It is truly a fantastic film with layered characters and the best 3D work audiences have ever seen Once it starts you are hooked from minute one Do yourselves a favor and pay the admission price because it is more than worth it,9

11 December 2013,There must be something wrong with the IMDb ratings!,The IMDb rating is now 8 5 and I was expecting a lot of this movie I also read a lot about it the movie of the year and so on I also a fan of Sandra Bullock I love science fiction but this is not science fiction it more like a computer game You feel like you manage different levels when watching But when you play games your are doing something you can influence the story but this is totally boring Sandra Bullock s moaning and panting just gets tedious and annoying The most terrible thing is when some invisible force drag Clooney in the right direction If the space station was spinning i could see some logic in that but now it looks weird very weird When Clooney finally let go of the rope the force suddenly disappears and the end of the rope floats weightless again Clooney drifting slowly away and Bullock falls toward the space station How did that happen Why did they choose that direction The movie lost all feeling of reality Great 3d effects but that is all there is to it How can such a boring movie get so high rating Can you buy rating and reviews at IMDb I always thought that was impossible but after this I don t trust IMDb rating anymore,1
9 October 2013,Don't Let Go! any chance of seeing it,Do you know why 3D was invented I do Because we had to see this in 3D because Gravity is the best film experience I ve ever had just like Life of Pi last year and Avatar four years ago Director Alfonso Cuar n managed bring absolutely different experience of breathtaking visuals bright colors and great directing Gravity follows a medical engineer Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and an astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney working together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space where even one mistake can cost you a life Since there is no one in the film except those two and Dr Stone is left alone quite shortly after the movie starts there are no much dialogues however it still manages to keep you tense and stressed any minute of it mostly because technically perfectly made visual 3D effects Emmanuel Lubezki is finally getting his first cinematography Oscar for doing and outstanding job of capturing Earth from space using lights to show us sunrise and making space very real for us Gravity is the only and first space movie that actually shows how beautiful world is from the astronaut s view The hardest part for cinematographer as usual is to properly deliver the reflections on real object in mirrors glasses and etc The scenes where astronauts are spinning in the open space seems to be very carefully done and watching realizing this brought so much enjoyment And of course visuals are massive effective and thrilling they totally bring tensity and scary emotions of being out there Additionally music composed by Steven Price absolutely gorgeous making each scene more beautiful and involving I personally think that he s one of the front runners in this year composer race What I did not like it the scenario how everything was happening Movie repeated every scene time by time they re under attack they stay alive and reach new destinations the are under attack they stay alive and reach another destination and so on It seemed a little artificial and boring The same time there is no much material for writing because of quite few dialogues But some Clooney s jokes were actually funny and he entertained a lot However I should admit that Sandra Bullock is at the top of her acting career In Gravity she did the best performance of her ever First because it s not easy to play that role to deliver emotions at its finest be strong and weak the same time Second she definitely has better awards material than in The Blind Side so she can easily make final top 5 at Oscars and Golden Globes woman who s sentimental to her dead baby fighting for survival in the space attempting suicide and staying alive it s kind of winning formula But Alfonso Cuar n is the one who really deserves applause because he combined sensation visual beauty tension and great acting in one movie which almost never happens and brought it to the screens in most entertaining way I could imagine Directors who shot action based Sci Fi thrillers have one of the hardest jobs to do They have to capture things that they have never seen in reality in this case space and to make the viewers experience the most realistic feelings I had the sense as if I was floating in above the Earth All in all Gravity is technical perfection but there could have been done more in writing part However it s already a landmark in Sci Fi as it s been Avatar when premiered,8
9 October 2013,"Great visuals, but over-rated film and mailed in performances by Bullock and Clooney.",This film has great visuals but that is about it Boring acting jobs by Bullock and Clooney I don t know why Hollywood feels the need to put miscast A listers in every feature Personally I feel this film would have been better with relatively unknown actors rather than stars like Bullock and Clooney that have the exact same screen presence and speech patterns no matter what film they are in Hard to believe them being astronauts when they have the exact same screen presence of every other role they ve had Go see it for the visuals but try to look past the mailed in performances of Bullock and Clooney and the sappy sentimental introspective look into Bullock s character Boring,5
5 October 2013,"see this in IMAX, but 3D unnecessary",Four films come to mind when I think about Gravity Mission to Mars Deep Impact WALL E and of course Apollo 13 You ll see what I mean when you watch it As others have said this film is visually stunning It s best to watch it on the biggest clearest screen you can An IMAX screen is ideal 2D is fine 3D is fine too but unnecessary because the 3D effect is used only occasionally Despite ideas lifted from a certain Brian De Palma film and a certain Pixar film Gravity is thoroughly enjoyable As a side note the similarity between George Clooney s character and Tim Allen s Buzz LIghtyear in voice and appearance is so close I kept expecting him to say To infinity and beyond Anyway back to the movie The action begins nearly right away and continues nonstop I ve seen 80 minute films that felt like 3 hours But this 90 minute film felt more like 5 minutes The action and the immersive visuals will give you the feeling you re on a theme park ride not in a regular movie Once it s over you ll want to go on it again,9

22 April 2015,In Space No One Can Hear You Gasp Wow !,I had an excuse for missing GRAVITY when it came out I wasn t all that keen on Mexican director s Alfonso Cuaron s CHILDREN OF MEN and I wasn t overly impressed with the rather threadbare premise of GRAVITY Every time I discussed it with someone who d seen it the conversation went something like this There doesn t seem to much to it Sandra Bullock gets trapped in space Is that all there is to it Well yes Theo but what it does it does very well and the three D is absolutely fantastic There s a scene where then I d get details of how the magic of cinema comes to life to an IMAX large screen Fair enough but I m someone who s interested in a strong story and having a film revolve around visual set pieces not too dissimilar to CHILDREN OF MEN wasn t enough to tempt me to buy a cinema ticket for GRAVITY Somewhat typically after seeing it on my laptop I am now kicking myself that I didn t watch it on a massive screen with 3D glasses on an IMAX screen When I was about twelve years old I read Nigel Kneale s novelization of his own 1979 QUATERMASS serial and early in the story there s a space disaster where a space station breaks up Kneale compares it to a shipwreck where the lucky ones are killed instantly because those inside the space station are not protected in the airless vacuum of space and die quickly Not so fortunate are those space walking outside in their spacesuits and will probably survive many hours or even a couple of days until their oxygen runs out It is a terrifying lonely death almost like being buried alive except being buried alive is a claustrophobic death where as drifting in space is an agoraphobic horror Cauron nails this horror of a space death very well What s worse suffocating in a tiny space capsule or suffocating inside a spacesuit in the vastness of space Go on choose one and like every other person who has seen the film we re propelled in the shoes of Ryan Stone where if she doesn t survive the mission she will die a terrible lonely death As I said the story is rather thin and concentrates on visuals and this is in no way to be taken as a criticism Cauron uses cinematography and editing so breath taking I could barely believe my eyes One sequence relatively early in to the film sees the camera pan in to the face of Stone but it does stop there because the camera then pans in to the helmet of Stone the camera is actually inside the space helmet The editing is so seamless I was gasping How d they manage to do that shot The film continues in this manner where one stunning and thrilling sequence gives way to another In a recent review of RUSH another film released in 2013 I asked myself why Ron Howard s movie didn t pick any up Oscar nominations but to be honest no film would stand a chance with the technical merits of GRAVITY which is absolutely perfect on a visual level a fact reflected by its sweeping of the boards at the 2014 Oscars though it lost out to 12 YEARS A SLAVE It must be said however that 2013 was an exceptional year for film making SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS Very few films are perfection and GRAVITY is not an exception to the rule There are a few elements of manipulation going on such as Stone being a mother therefore the audience are supposed to feel for her even more but this isn t necessary and I was totally caught up in her ordeal without the need for any backstory or violins playing over the score There s a plot turn about two thirds of the way through that I instantly knew was a hallucination I also have the feeling the laws of astro physics were constantly being bended if not broken and the ending wraps everything up a bit too conveniently to be entirely credible When this is said and done however it doesn t really matter because the flaws are very minor and the ordeals and setbacks Stone finds herself in are a testimony of humanity s courage and spirit of adventure while GRAVITY itself is a testimony to the modern wonders of cinema,9
15 December 2013,Sandra is awful and acts like she cant think for herself.,I am not sure why people loved this show Is it because George and Sandra star in it This show is bad NASA spends years simulating missions and practice things going bad It costs millions of dollars to train astronauts and send them into space When things go bad Sandra was acting like she had no idea what to do She needed George to tell her what to do Another thing that drove me crazy Sandra keeps moaning like she is having sex I wasted 30 minutes in the show before I jettison There are better NASA shows out there,1

4 January 2022,"Good things, but still somewhat let me down.",Believe me I wanted to like this movie even more Some things worked like the directing visuals and sequences All were thrilling and Alfonso Cuar n is a very talented guy but at a certain point it got to be a little bit too over the top and uneven At some moments what the movie expects me to believe with the scientific laws of nature and practicality of certain events is asking for a bit too much Maybe I ll give this movie a second chance viewing again one day but still I ve seen much better movies about space adventures,7
3 October 2013,Simply breathtaking - you cannot get closer to a real spacewalk than this,I ve just returned from a 4DX screening moving seats artificial wind etc and my childhood dream has come true I have spacewalked I studied to be a physicist I love sci fi and I did have an idea about the challenges you face as an astronaut as space is really hostile towards life your oxygen running out pressure to be kept micrometeorites lack of gravity and it s consequences Once I heard about the movie s basic setup 2 astronauts bound to each other after a space accident I knew what problems they would be facing the loneliness the tiny chance for survival no room for mistakes but room for heroics emotions and sacrifice I thought it s a fantastic setup for a movie maker to exploit Well let me tell you I got much more than I expected The visuals rip you right out of your comfort zone on Earth where you always know where up down left right is The enormous speed differences in flying objects and you the fact that you can just drift away with nothing to hold on makes you re think the rules you are used to I ve really loved how the story actually gives a great physics education to the audience about how things are in space without explicitly saying so great for kids All this with such incredible visuals that you simply cannot avoid being IN the suit IN the story being thrown around fearing for YOUR life Sandra Bullock and George Clooney don t let us down with their acting Clooney is not one bit less than we are used to but Bullock she gives as Oscar worthy performance In most scenes she is alone and has to carry the movie along alone a demanding task but she does with such emotional expression that makes this probably her best film I dare to say there s actually a third actor Earth itself You ve never seen it s face like this before in so many colors during the day and at night and you get a special rare view of something too I let you find that out in the theatre Ladies even if you are totally uninterested in space movies this one will keep you on the edge of your seat and will give you the emotional catharsis you might expect from a really outstanding movie Just go Finally there s a twist waiting for you at the end only there you will fully understand the title Gravity,10
8 October 2013,Gripping tension and visual splendor. A true movie event.,Gravity Cuaron 2013 A To my mind those who knock the script are mostly failing to see the forest for the trees Problems are there to be sure but to avoid seeing this would be a regrettable miscalculation For me the script worked in a terse elemental sort of way as it pokes toward transcendent themes that are better evoked through the visual and aural landscape than the dialog But I think the story elements stand solely because Bullock lifts them on up on her shoulders and ultimately her performance not only deeply impressed me but moved me I believe most writers and I fall squarely within this camp lack the necessary vocabulary to express the wonder of these visuals Thankfully they speak for themselves Yet perhaps I am most pleased to find a film so rare in the current American mega production model that is precisely as long as it must be I can t speculate how this one will age even four years have not been kind to AVATAR but for now it is miraculous Final thought For a much more eloquent assessment I suggest you consult MZS s review at RogerEbert com www rogerebert com reviews gravity 2013 or AO Scott at the New York Times,9

Somewhat Entertaining,Astronauts Matt Kowalski George Clooney and Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock are repairing a telescope in space when a Russian satellite explodes and sends the debris their way at very fast speeds The beginning of this movie feels like it s the end of a movie when disaster strikes and they overcome it and we all go home But that can t happen as this just started Bummer Gravity would be better viewed in 3 D if you can manage it The CGI visuals are truly outstanding even in 2 D We see Kowalski and Ryan try to get back to the ISS International Space Station and one would think there would be tension and suspense during this attempt to get back but this didn t happen for me But if you watch in 3 D you will be ducking debris every 10 seconds Quite exciting though For me the tension and suspense came much later when Ryan was by herself in the abandoned Chinese space station Hey wouldn t you be tense in a space craft where all the buttons and controls are in Chinese and you don t know the language Huh Gravity was nominated for Best Picture Say what Give me a break Sandra Bullock was nominated for Best Actress Huh The Academy must have had their collective heads in a Black Hole when they made these nominations Sandra Bollock is a good actress but it didn t show up in here George Clooney was good but his character acted too much like the disaster was a walk in the park I guess he knew this was only a movie Still this was somewhat entertaining but highly over rated The dialogues between Kowalski and Ryan were lame for the most part No good lines nothing funny The star of this movie is the CGI visuals and again they are spectacular But that s it View it in 3 D and enjoy it Otherwise it s a Help I ve fallen in Space and can t get up type movie 6 10 Violence No not between the characters just the violence that occurred in space Sex No Nudity No Language One F Bomb uttered by SB,6
30 December 2015,"Stellar graphics, weak story",I think it is not a secret that this film has absolutely 0 plot and it fails to create suspense since it starts extremely slowly and the weak dialogue just propels the mediocrity of this movie as a story Of course it extremely unrealistic and most of the actions can be easily debunked but that is an another story However nobody can take away the absolutely outstanding achievement in cinematography editing visual effects sound effects etcetera that is exactly why this film won 7 Oscars none of them for good acting or storyline of course but still the movie has left its mark in film history for sure The graphics were truly outstandingly impressive unfortunately that was the essence of this film this film could have easily been one of the greatest sci fi films ever made if only it had a better more interesting story and the dialogue wasn t so dull and pointless It is worth watching just to enjoy the awesome visual effects but other than that its plain good thing it was only 90 minutes long Has got to be one of the weakest plots ever sadly 4 10 for the graphics,4
13 March 2014,Incredible,This has become one of my favourite movies Everyone would say prior to the release it was a stupid concept and that no one would see this film The moment i saw the trailer i knew that it could scrape in some well deserved Academy Awards But then i saw Gravity and it blew me away entirely The fact it made so much money as it did was also quite a shock but it was well earned Just from watching a few scenes one can realize how much work that was really put in to this project The day the Oscar nominations were announced and Gravity came out with 10 i also knew that this was a well deserved achievement If anyone who saw the 86th Oscars and thought gravity didn t deserve these awards watch the film before you pass judgement It takes you to a new place in life and is just impressive in every single way,10

29 December 2013,Beautifully done. I loved that it was very technical.,Normally I would have given this an above average mark but not too large The thing that made me grade it with a 9 is the decision to stick to technical details even if as my wife proved it some viewers might be put off by them So if you imagine that a movie with Clooney and Bullock must be a romance don t go watching this film The film is almost like a screen play with a lot of special effects Practically there are only two actors Sandra Bullock being the lead and George Clooney a supporting actor with a few other actors voicing mission control and so on The film is only superficially an action movie with the characters fighting for survival with the real story the interactions of people with outer space and the feeling of isolation one gets over there In order to fully understand the physics and orbital mechanics I would direct you to a lot of space blog posts from specialists discussing and praising the accuracy of most of the concepts in the film As for my subjective point of view I liked the movie but mostly because I am a space buff Some of the scenes like the one when Clooney untethers were pointless while others over the top with special effects and way too loud music The soul of the movie though stands up to scrutiny and I am really glad Cuaron made the effort to bring his vision to the big screen A lot of people recommended watching the film on the big screen in 3D I did not have the opportunity so I saw it low res on my computer It s just as awesome Perhaps for less technical people or uninterested in space it would not be so pleasing My wife did not enjoy it For me most of the concepts in the film were already known but it was damn nice seeing them on the screen like that,9

12 October 2013,Special effects. Only.,Good parts i the special effects and the 3D experience of space ii the symbolism of life emerging from space destruction then water and finally earth last scene basically and iii Having free tickets for this one Bad parts Everything else The rating of this movie is definitely inflated seriously 8 7 They say Gravity is a drama but probably they don t understand what drama is There is no drama without character development emotional investment without dilemmas or confrontations The plot is laughable the dialog is childish and the main storyline totally predictable My 3 stars go solely to visual effects Bottom line If you want to see some cool visual space 3d effects or you don t invest much in viewing you should go If you invest intellect and emotion in your movie don t you will be utterly disappointed,2

17 November 2013,Emotionally engaging from beginning to end,It s rare that I review a film as being been near perfect but Gravity was just that The cinematography really tries to push the boundaries and perfectly executes the intention of making the viewers feel like they are in the situations unfolding on screen Matt Kolwasky George Clooney quickly and easily attaches the audience to him You love the character and feel for him You want him to survive the entire film George Clooney beautifully portrays a man that stays calm through extreme situations This film would not be what it is without him Sandra Bulloock does a great job some of the time but you feel the sense that sometime she is really forcing portraying the character of Dr Ryan Stone in some situations but not so much that it was unbearable to watch Director Alfonso Cuar n really out did himself here The screenplay was well written no complaints there and the music score at the end just emotionally draws you in even more while watching this masterpiece The only reason I gave this film a 9 10 was simply because what kind of film critic gives any movie a perfect If I did then I would not be a film critic but from a personal point of view It s a 10,9
15 November 2013,Stop advertising as a good movie,I went to see this movie based on IMDb rating but i just don t understand why this score and all the good reviews over the net are all about This movie has no story development no character development and the scrip sucks What took me by surprise was George Clooney taking this mediocre paper that just throws a couple of jokes It goes nowhere and the scientific flaws are everywhere The sound effects and music are the only you can rescue here If you want to hear a girl moaning all the run time this is for you No even the 3d or Imax can save this movie Waste of time Your better go watch 2001 A Space Odissey a real masterpiece of science fiction and we will talk then,1

14 November 2013,what film were you people watching,Save your time and money and go watch anything else This film was absolutely ridiculous and dreadful I don t know what film other people have been watching to rate this a good movie maybe they mixed the film reels up but what I saw was the worst film I ever had the displeasure of watching Remember when your in the cinema deciding to watch this choose anything else as you will thank me However one good part which earned its one point was George Clooney Sandra Bullock films have gone from bad to worse with this being the absolute bottom of the pile Want to watch a decent film in space rent Apollo 13 or absolutely anything as I have just wasted 2 hours of my life which I want back,1
27 July 2016,Soooooooo Boring,I am not even sure I should be reviewing this movie since I failed to watch it all the way through But I couldn t carry on any longer as I would have found standing still in a desert less boring How they could have made a movie with such excellent actors as George Clooney Sandra Bullock and Ed Harris so dull is beyond me I was actually really looking forward to it after all the Oscar hype about it but if you have seen any trailers then you have probably seen the best parts of this movie Even though the cinematography is good that is about all that is good One of the worst movies ever made,1

20 October 2013,A Cinematic Experience Like No Other,There is no other film experience on Earth like Gravity Which makes sense keeping in mind the whole movie was located in space with only the ending scene being on Earth Alfonso Cuaron has struck gold with his masterpiece Gravity It explores the silence of space where all you can hear are your breaths and your thoughts as you spin around aimlessly This is usually harmless until a crisis like debris comes into play From then on Sandra Bullock puts on an amazing performance which will definitely give her an Oscar nod and George Clooney is his usual affable self One thing that really defined this movie s greatness was its careful attention to being realistic From the tears slipping down Sandra Bullock s cheeks actually floating off her face to the oxygen in her suit depleting at a steady rate this movie doesn t look over any detail or flaw Instead it uses simplicity and directness to flow the movie along Nothing was that unbelievable in this movie Even though sound was a luxury in this movie the emotional side of the film was not Confined to tight spaces Bullock couldn t really do anything to hide her emotions She couldn t run anywhere to hide or walk into a different room Instead we all saw and felt what she was going through and actually cared about what happening to her character Another thing this movie did that was great was switch perspectives of the camera We went from seeing what was happening from the character s eyes to a third person view to a wide camera angle all in a few seconds And the best part is the camera was so fluent and coherent that we didn t even notice that the perspectives were changing until it actually happened Genius filmmaking I could go on about this things this movie did right because to be honest I can t think of anything I didn t like in the movie which is extremely rare Overall this is a new kind of cinema experience that cannot be replicated again Yes that was a challenge directors Everyone in the target audience and beyond should see this movie because of its realistic sense of things and its careful attention to detail The cinematography is beautiful and the views and perspectives this movie gives are to die for The emotional core themes and moral lessons this movie offers should be soaked up with ease And the way it draws you into the story and what s happening is truly an amazing feat,

31 December 2013,"Spellbinding effects, Average story.",After all the hype and expectation it s time to bring Gravity back down to earth Yes it is a spectacular film and a crime not to watch it in 3D on a big screen but even though I did Gravity was still missing something At the start you are in awe of the wonderful visual effects and feeling of space once you dive into the story though you find yourself wondering why you don t care more about Sandra Bullock s character Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney Don t get me wrong Gravity does stay away from another silly Hollywood space film but in the end the script is just not strong enough Everyone raved about the performances in this film but really Clooney re plays his cocky smug character and Bullock spends most of the film panicking Both in my opinion a bit annoying You should watch this film but it s not the end of the world if you miss it,7
19 November 2013,a one-of-a-kind visual experience,Gravity is that rare movie that while a tour de force on a technical level also happens to come with a great deal of its own pardon the pun gravitas Sandra Bullock in a bravura near one woman performance plays Dr Ryan Stone an astronaut on her first mission into outer space sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope While she s space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non operational satellite Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate as closely as is humanly possible the experience of floating adrift in outer space the weightlessness the uncontrollable spinning warning take your Dramamine beforehand the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie They make us care about the people to whom this is happening and without that all the special effects in the world couldn t make this concept work Even from inside a space helmet Bullock runs the gamut of emotions from queasiness to fear to anger to despair to resignation to hope to determination It s all there packed within a taut hour and a half long running time In a way a film like Gravity makes movie reviewing almost superfluous since it s virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience Go watch it for yourself,9

5 October 2013,"Best film of the year, one of a kind",Gravity is a one of a kind film that portrays a realistic view of being up in space with a thrilling story that asks us can we continue and move on with our lives when hope seems lost and we feel we have nothing left to go back to While I am normally not a fan of Sandra Bullock she exceeds beyond expectations as she delivers a wide range of believable emotions and the audience become a part of her character as we see through her perspective of both the life threatening and personal challenges she faces to get back home And lets not forget about George Clooney as he becomes the perfect voice of reason motivation and comfort that we need to hear when hope seems lost for Bullock s character The effects in this film are just jaw dropping Really convinces you are actually in space especially since there is no sound of in any of the scenes in space The cg planet Earth in the film is so beautiful and well detailed By the end of this film you a have a greater appreciation for our planet having air gravity and sound This film definitely deserves an Oscar for best director Alfonso Cuaron along with best screenplay best cinematography and best vfx,9
20 October 2013,GRAVITY : One hell of a ride,Its a Visual Paradise Ground breaking beautiful and technically perfect The film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they were shot it in space The film is a visual masterpiece Its Takes 3D experience to the whole new level The views of the earth from space are simply majestic beautiful The Sunrise Sunset all are visually stunning Also the performances of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are outstanding They match up to the Quality of movie Gravity is a rare breed Simplistic but so refreshingly new Its and Awesome Visual Experience Must Watch,9
15 February 2021,Cult B movie,Arguably one of the worst films I ve ever seen A B movie with two A listers in the lead roles No narrative just blow after blow of attempted suspense pitiful,1
21 November 2013,A wonderful panic attack,For the first time in a long long time a film made me feel like a kid again From the very first long and glorious shot of Gravity I was completely lost in the world Cuar n created for me and for the next ninety minutes I was on the edge of my seat and struggling for breath It was like a 1 5 hour panic attack a wonderful wonderful panic attack Suspension of disbelief hadn t been so easy for me in years and part of it was the masterful use of 3D by far the best I ve seen so far but most of it was thanks to Cuar n s directorial work This was a perfectly paced thriller pure cinema at its most condensed the editing the sound the cinematography the acting all coming perfectly together to keep my eyes glued to the screen or to the 3D glasses Leaving the theater I was stumbling still not feeling quite at home in normal gravity Then I went on the film s board to see people s impressions and sure enough it was filled to the brim with complaints about the various scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities in the film I m something of a geek myself and plot holes drive me mad But I just don t get how so many people could hate a film like Gravity so much Comparisons to Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff seem ridiculous to me this wasn t about a real space mission it wasn t about the space program or technology it was a thriller adventure focused on atmosphere character study and a semi spiritual journey that character goes through in the hostile territory of unfamiliar life Sure looking back at it a lot of it wasn t very realistic but when a film works on as many levels as Gravity did I really feel sorry for people focusing on the little flaws and I m so happy that for once I didn t,10
6 October 2013,Perhaps Gravity is about the World today ..,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
10 February 2022,Visually stunning,On a routine shuttle maintenance mission in space two astronauts find themselves caught up in a life threatening disaster Stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney This is visually stunning The CGI is incredible It s almost non stop tension throughout the movie too and carries some decent emotion The plot is actually very simple and the movie is short Unfortunately I did get motion sickness watching this due to all the spinning,7
8 October 2013,"Thoughtful, breathtaking, ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride.",Like Avatar this is a movie unlike anything you may have see before Following an extensive tracking shot in space we meet Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock Dr Stone is a medical engineer completing repairs on a mechanical arm attached to the space shuttle in orbit hundreds of miles above the earth Jet packing around like a middle aged Buzz Lightyear is Matt Kowalski George Clooney Whilst defiantly attempting to break the space walk record Matt still finds time to trash talk and listen to music whilst floating free above the earth We get to hear mission control and all is well until suddenly not so much any more Debris from a ricocheting satellite is heading the astronauts way and it s travelling fast Houston we most definitely have a problem events then start to escalate fast with some spectacular destruction If the debris does not get you on the first pass it will be back after a ninety minute orbit perfect movie suspense material We then follow the only two characters we really get to meet as they struggle against adversity and an unforgiving environment as they attempt to survive After a while you realise you are witnessing two actors to all intents and purposes acting within a zero gravity setting even though you know that cannot be true Once you accept this as the reality you are presented with it is easy to jump aboard the roller coaster ride the film then becomes Despite being action packed and edge of the seat tense all within a relatively short running time of 91 minutes director Alfonso Cuaron finds time to innovate with some classic scenes Dr Stone slowly rotating in a foetal position tears floating away in zero gravity and globules of fire suspended in mid air a few notable examples The director makes good use of sound or lack thereof and on occasion includes vertigo inducing claustrophobic sequences that may have you staring at the floor in relief as characters spin out of control into the infinite void of space The story is simple but largely effective how far would you go to survive when every natural element is attempting to kill you The effects are unlike anything you may have seen before the acting from Bullock is first rate she may never have been better It is good to see her back on the big screen and in such trim form Negatives Clooney does his usual shtick and is more casual than you might imagine the character would be One also wonders why Stone is up there wielding a spanner in space with the emotional baggage she is carrying Ultimately whatever the ending this is a life affirming film and most defiantly not science fiction with alien monsters notably absent How the film was achieved can be found elsewhere but within the acting constraints imposed Cuaron has extracted an impressive performance from Bullock who may yet trouble Oscar when the time comes around again One of the years best and likely to prove a big box office hit if the early reception is anything to go this may also be the closest most audiences get to experiencing real space in their life time Summary Thoughtful breathtaking ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride Like it or hate it you will not have seen anything like it before this comes highly recommended especially on a big screen,9
23 December 2021,Awesome,The story of this movie is simple but very good The story does not have much depth but its execution makes it a story full of tension accompanied by good character development excellent performances it manages to be a good thriller full of tension and uncertainty about what will happen The film has very good direction good special effects good production design good sound good editing and very good photography The only flaw I find is that there are conveniences that happen just at the exact moment to help the protagonist to get out of the problem helping to make the movie more exciting Still this movie is very well done and manages to be an amazing story,9
16 August 2017,A huge disappointment,Ryan and Matt the rookie and the veteran astronauts suffer a terrible accident while undergoing a routine repair mission Debris from a Russian satellite caused a chain reaction and big pieces started orbiting in their direction striking them almost without any warning The two are left alone in space detached from their shuttle with minimum survival resources so they must team up and devise a plan which will hopefully bring them back safely to earth I have to say that I really cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated I am too a fan of the main actors but that doesn t mean that I will give 10 to any movie in which they act I heard that it looks gorgeous that it has a great story etc etc but it doesn t It looks OK but nothing more than that its story is pretty generic predictable and linear with very little unexpected events to induce a sense of suspense or drama The characters don t inspire anything and thus I didn t feel any remorse for their situation Ryan is supposedly a brilliant mind but she acts like an under average person not doing anything related to a genius at all In addition I simply cannot understand the fate chosen for Matt as there was no reason for such an ending to he s character it s related to Gravity I am utterly disappointed by this film especially as I had great expectations from it due to the high amount of hype surrounding it almost regretting the time used to see it Other love it but I don t I don t hate it but I cannot recommend it to anyone,5
28 February 2016,Every human being should have the chance to watch it at the least once in his life,To all the people that valued this movie 1 10 I ve never written a review but in this case seeing that this movie received 1 over 10 I would like to share some thoughts First of all I wonder how much you would evaluate a movie like Sharknado or Fifty Shades of Grey This movie deserve more than 1 because surely is not the worse movie you saw or you will see in your lifetime Originality please enunciate me a movie that is talking about destruction about chain reaction caused by debris Who is telling that Apollo 13 was better remember that the story was not original it happened in reality it was already there and the director already knew what happened not having to invent it There is a difference between reproducing and originality State of art visual special effects maybe you watched your movie on a tablet or laptop but for the time this movie was produced no better technology for special effects has been used before For example I like Inception but there is a big difference between filming no gravity effects with a normal camera and doing it with a 3D IMAX camera and the Academy Award Oscar is the evidence If you watched it in a 2D small screen then it s not director s fault To conclude I do not believe the director had even the idea to reproduce the reality or teaching science but only to show how beautiful is the life in our home Earth and how difficult is to survive outside of it,10
17 October 2013,Amazing Movie !!! A Must Must Must Watch...,If u want to experience the feeling of being in space view of Earth from space want to feel space thrill then u must watch GRAVITY Amazing space film I ve ever seen Awesome Direction Cinematography and Acting There is one condition U must watch this film in IMAX theaters Because in IMAX U not only see a film but u experience it In IMAX 3D u fill like u r also there in the space with those characters and experiencing the same thing and second IMAX has Mind Blowing sound that no other theater can beat its sound quality Also this film has some breathtaking scenes and 3D effects that I ve literally closed my eyes for a moment in some scenes A Salute to Director Alfonso Cuaron for making such a wonderful film A MUST MUST MUST Watch film,10
13 August 2022,Gravity,A good movie I enjoy watching the movie The visual effects were great and Sandra Bullock s acting was excellent The soundtrack in the movie was great the ending was great and the story was too simple and have some illogical events I recommend you to watch the movie and my rating is 7 4 10,7
16 October 2013,worst movie of the year,lets start with One hundred million dollar wasted This movie is the worst i ve seen all year I wish I never left home Nothing is realistic and being a movie I m fine with that But when its five minutes in and i m hoping they kill off the female lead my emotions are kick to the curb fast I continue to hope that every minute of the movie after that she would die It s just not the ride of a movie i was ready for if i had a chance to watch again i would rather pay and then go somewhere else anywhere its not worth any time 1 10 I want that time BACK,1
10 November 2013,Ignore the hype and it comes crashing down to earth.,Stunning mesmerising breath stealing magnificent excuse the obvious pun out of this world quite simply one of the greatest films ever visually Visually Not the best film of the month not the best film of the year best film in those time lines visually Definitely yes The film hypnotically captures your eyes and takes them for a masterclass in special effects Not often can i associate the word beautiful with a film but with this every scene draws that description And it is one small step for special effects and one giant leap for future films to look at and study and pick at and aspire to be like couldn t help it sorry Now with the deserving plaudits out the way onto the over exaggeration Yes it is a stunning film but it isn t undoubtedly the best film of the year as some critics have stated clearly jumping the gun and somersaulting onto the bandwagon And to dismiss Oscar nominated and winning films so rapidly is a farce In terms of UK release we have had Django Unchained Lincoln Zero Dark Thirty Man of Steel even This is the End Trance and Filth These are films of the top of my head that I enjoyed more than Gravity Now of course it is within someones opinion if they enjoyed Gravity more but i can t see why As i have said visually it is hard to compete with but in terms of acting and the story they simply don t compete with films out previously Sandra Bullock can be a great actress as she has shown in The Blind Side but is there really all that much to her performance Is there all that much you need to do in that circumstance Now don t get me wrong it is understandable that the process she had to go through in filming would have been tough But in terms of emotion and versatility i found her dull The story is stereotypical of a movie where everything goes wrong I do hate to be judgmental of the film but i feel the acclaim it has been constantly credited with is over the top And the piles of praise only adds to hype and that only leads to disappointment because it can t match the hype that has been conjured up by the hallucinating media A great film and worthy of the watch but don t let the heaps of hype cannonball you onto the ever populating bandwagon that seems to be trouncing the world of films,7

6 November 2013,Gravity...more like Dead Weight,Really people Do you not have an inkling what a really good movie is This is possibly the worst drivel I ve seen in decades It was sentimental tripe Monumentally Bad Clooney and Bullock are way to old to go into space I thought its gonna get better but boy o boy it just kept getting worse The 3D effects weren t even that spectacular Lost In Space was better than this I should have know with Clooney in another space movie Solaris was as rotten as this But this stunk even more Clooney is great I loved him in Up In The Air and The Descendants He just needs to stay out of space AVOID AVOID AVOID this movie Or take along some antacid in case you do go or a barf bag It s a good thing I hadn t eaten popcorn,1

15 October 2013,even sandy's underpants were boring,i have no idea how the masses have been able to muster the patience this movie requires and i m more than a little confused about the praise there isn t enough story to fill a commercial i m not sure how to fill ten lines of text even if i were to describe everything that happens in the movie they passed up every opportunity to pepper in something interesting sandy was fantastically boring george a total snooze i had heard tales of something visually stunning happening but i wasn t impressed by anything it was very sparse unenjoyable trite and lazy not subtle i want my time back i want my money back i m not on team jesse but one more movie like this,1
29 August 2016,thankfully it's not even 90 minutes long,For starters I think you should know this is the first review I write in IMDb However I was so angry at this movie and so astonished by its rating that I couldn t help but come here and try and save somebody else s 90 minutes Sandra Bullock is a mission specialist sent in space to do some magic but since the start you re constantly shown how she sucks at her jobs and how in general she is unprepared to do anything in space The only other character George Clooney is supposed to be an expert astronaut who ends but being a total kid by just being focused on beating the record of untethered space time For some unfathomable reason the Russians evil guys because duh America decide to take down a satellite with a friggin missile instead of making it land like all normal people do This causes a chain reaction where for extreme bad luck practically everything humankind has in space is destroyed Aside from the laughable premise a few unbearable things make this film a waste of 90 minutes I m going to keep it short just to save you some extra time 1 conversation between the two characters is dull and pointless 2 main character keeps narrating everything she does and think Jeez just shut up you re alone in space who are you talking to 3 George clooney s character is just an idiotic parenthesis 4 The endless chain of incredible bad luck the main character has can only be explained by the fact that this movie needed to be longer than 15 minutes No other logic thought can justify any of it 5 the only good part of the movie is the graphics but for that you can just watch interstellar or the martian and also enjoy a good film,1
2 June 2015,Untapped Potential Makes For an Average Movie,Going into Gravity I had high hopes Its got good reviews a great metascore several awards etc How could I not expect something great The movie wasn t amazing It was completely overrated in my point of view Sure the CGI was great even on DVD the characters likable the acting well done and all that stuff but I felt like all this could have been better The characters had so much potential but were never fully explored Sure there was a bit of back story for Ryan Stone but not nearly as much for Matt Kowalski Still Ryan s back story wasn t enough to warrant any real or deep character development They felt somewhat forced at times which really took away from it You may say that this was a movie made for its visuals but the fact that it still tried to put character development in made me feel like it certainly wasn t trying to make itself all about the visuals The acting was quite average if you ask me Lots of hyperventilating but otherwise it didn t stand out to me as much as other acting has ex Brad Pitt from Twelve Monkeys The characters were well executed but it wasn t an absolutely brilliant performance or anything Gravity is a movie of constant tension and suspense and yet I never felt that Ryan was in any real danger It was fairly obvious that she would survive and towards the end I felt like she was doing certain things simply to create conflict no matter how minor A lot of tension material was recycled throughout the movie as well I m sure that this is realistic but it felt very unoriginal eventually Overall Gravity had so much potential The characters seemed to be the driving force of the movie over the story it wasn t a particularly interesting or deep story and yet that potential never felt like it was truly tapped into In the end it was really just an average movie but could have been far better Its worth watching if your interested but that s about it for this movie,5
29 July 2017,"Trite and overrated, although not totally lacking merit - Gravity is ultimately disappointing.",I think Gravity must be the first ever instance of a screensaver being re calibrated and re packaged as a cinematic experience It s all well and good demonstrating what the latest and greatest in special effects is capable of but of what use is it without a scrap of substance to back it up Rebellious though it may sound films such as Gravity are neither enhancing nor prolonging cinema in fact they are killing it and if there is a genuine zeitgeist amongst audiences that this is the future then cinema has very little future to look forward to Gravity opens with a blank screen followed by a series of ultimately pointless statistics pertaining to the nature of the space vacuum Its temperatures we re told fluctuate between minus 148 and positive 258 Sound it says is unable travel So what To what is this any reference Where is this relevant later on We then begin with a startling composition of the lower hemisphere of Earth from outer space our eyes are distracted by the land mass to the left of the frame as it slowly comes to form due to the Earth s rotating failing to notice the object which sails into our eye line from the hard right of the screen Lo and behold it is the Hubble Telescope and we meet our characters in the midst of spacewalking their way to upgrading said telescope One of them is Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney a Texan stereotype with a brash attitude a love of old cars country music and a backstory that saw his ex wife leave him 20 years ago His opposite number is Sandra Bullock s Ryan Stone a comparative rookie a woman who doesn t really belong in space whose past tragedy is her young daughter s recent death and who seems to be perpetually nervous when compared to Kowalski s bombing around confidently on a jetpack Disaster strikes when out of nowhere debris from an exploded satellite that has collided with a second satellite sends a glut of space junk the way of our leads There is some clumsy propaganda about it being the fault of the Russian Federation but this all acts as the catalyst for Cuar n s feature to turn into a mad dash for the sanctuary of a working spaceship and then home as the methodical Kowalski and the unhinged rookie Stone grapple with both one another and the elements Understanding why Gravity has done so well and received a lot of praise is at once both baffling and painstakingly obvious It is an incredibly simplistic film people take to it because of its linear nature easy causality and the not having to follow any kind of narrative Much in the same way crowds took to James Cameron s Avatar for similar reasons the special effects play their role in hooking people in It is also the case a character you expect to be around by the end is removed from the piece very early on which I think has stunned people into thinking they ve seen something of greater substance because they ve not previously seen it happen The film essentially consists of a string of action set pieces told from the constrained perspective of those involved as they dodge a series of life threatening near misses Some of these are born out of the chance event of the space debris flying their way others rely on the more convoluted occurrence of an onboard fire Limited air supply also acts as a rudimentary source of drama These set pieces might well happen in any order and be of any length of time There is a heavy reliance on imagery and visuals a complete lack of story and an all but total lack of complexity The film s apparent core strength that of a strong female lead in Bullock s character raises further questions She has short hair a boy s name Ryan something the film bothers to bring to our attention when Kowalski mentions it and gets to fulfill the role of an astronaut a job otherwise synonymous with men She is androgynous in this respect but it is Alan Evans writing for The Guardian who points out that she needs either chance or other men to rescue her from every situation rarely does she use her own ingenuity and indeed spends most of the film a gibbering wreck The over not to mention needless use of shots of her dressed in her underwear when not in a space suit is equally perplexing I accept on the one hand the majesty of the special effects and their ability to bring planet Earth to life as this rotating orb of blue ocean white cloud cover and green land mass as we float around in the space vacuum In terms of characterisation Cuar n seems to want to tell a story about somebody dealing with grief discovering that life carries on and coming to want to grab it by the horns again and this is admirable but it gets lost I note with deference as to how small and insignificant the film seems to want to tell us we really are in the grand scheme of things Earth Space the Universe etc And yet the film is piecemeal and ultimately a little underwhelming dare I say even dull People have mistaken well worn disaster movie genre tropes for top level art because it had a shiny surface or because they felt like they were able to reach out and touch it or something If enough people get it into their heads that this is the future of film making or what constitutes a cinematic experience then there will not be much of a future to look forward to,5
6 November 2021,Impressive,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,7
1 March 2014,Absolute garbage,No character development and you are supposed to empathy My god no real story at all Highly technical but so is Star Wars and Star Trek but you won t see any of those true classics nominated for best picture anytime soon Bullock huffs and puffs Looks fairly good The only real comparison I can think of is the Tom Hanks Apollo 13 masterpiece and an older version known as Marooned Both light years beyond this dribble Must be a lean year in the movie industry to have this garbage nominated for best picture Another clunker for the Clooney camp Can anyone remember Solaris Bad Bad Bad Dear God this was BAD Please do not win this Oscar,1
31 October 2013,One of a Kind Experience,Well where to start Heard a lot about this movie and read a lot of good comments about this movie so wanted to watch it desperately So finally watched it and it was an excellent experience for me I have never had such an experience before People drifting in space fighting for survival all these scenes enthralled me The story of the movie is very simple but don t want to tell you The experience is very different I am sure you have not have experienced anything like it before So if you are planning to go for this movie watch it in 3 D only and don t wait for DVD watch it in theatres only This is the type of movie which is made for theatres only,9
5 October 2013,Good movie but flawed physics,The movie is a treat for the senses in every way Visual auditory and fairly exciting I enjoyed the movie seen in 3D and rank it fairly high in terms of good science fiction SPOILER SPOILER An issue I have is with one aspect of the movie that ignores the laws of physics yet this aspect becomes a plot point from which all else follows I m guessing many most won t know notice care about this but those of us with a science background will catch it immediately When Bullock and Clooney overshoot the ISS and Bullock gets entangled in the Soyuz parachute cord Clooney still tethered to Bullock zips by but then as the tether reaches its max length he is jerked to a halt The reality is this would have triggered a shift in momentum back along the vector he was traveling he would have bounced as it were and been pushed back towards Bullock End of story so the writers ignored this see Newton s Laws Even if the event portrayed was accurate we clearly see that all of Clooney s momentum has been negated So at that point both Bullock and Clooney have zero momentum relative to each other relative to the ISS At that point Bullock could have grabbed the parachute line and pulled momentum towards the ISS would be the result or could have grabbed the tether and pulled Clooney towards her or Clooney might have been able to get out of the jetpack give it a good push away from himself and once again be pushed towards Bullock as he gained momentum in the opposite direction In all cases the 2 could have easily made it to the ISS It would have been a better story in my opinion killing off Clooney was just a plot device to give Sandra an all alone aspect There are several other flaws in how physics is ignored in the movie but they are much more technical and it is a movie after all Most would not notice,7

6 October 2013,Don't believe the hype!,I rushed to see this film on the strength of the IMDb reviews I left the theater wondering if I d seen a different film First off the 3d visuals were absolutely spellbinding That mitigated my disappointment with the rest of the film to a certain extent However the thin story and weak dialogue kept dragging me out of the action Sandra bullock did her best with the on the nose dialogue that was laughably bad at times She didn t seem to be the right fit for the role but I don t think she can blamed for bad writing and misdirection no one told the director that thirty minutes of hyperventilating might be unnecessary realism By all means go see this film for the spectacular visuals but don t expect a story to go along with the spectacle Even Jim Cameron managed a decent story with Avatar Sadly they missed an opportunity to create a scifi classic here,6

8 December 2014,A sci-fi thriller that doubles as film art,I didn t know how to start this review I thought I hate Sandra Bullock was a bit too harsh Even though it s not far from the truth Then I came up with I m a movie hipster sometimes But I ve done that before What could entice some to read this I think I have your attention now with my honesty I could go into my hearing about Gravity and then the trailers not doing it for me Which is also true But I haven t seen an Alfonso Cuaron film I didn t love I m not saying I loved Gravity It was better than I expect And a side note that come to play later the ending was spoiled for me The film follows an American crew in space as they do what astronauts do do experiments and fix equipment Chaos ensues when debris from a Russian satellite shoots their way The crew scramble to find a way back to earth before the debris comes in contact with their ship No spoilers that is the plot of the entire film These astronauts are dealing with a catastrophe in space A movie like this in just about anyone else s hands would have a slow burn bore Alfonso Cuaron doesn t make boring films The man is an artist behind the lens The first shot of the film last fifteen minutes long It goes places I ve never seen done in a sci fi film He comes up some ingenious angles and trickery This is the first time that I can fully say the general movie going audience got it right This is a movie that should make 200 million dollars or more It s art at it s core A small story about two people deal with adverse conditions trying not to die The way the film is shot is unreal The only sounds are voice and music There is no sound in space And I love sci fi films in space shot that way Cuaron puts the audience in space for 90 minutes And I would happily go back He pulls out great performances from Clooney and Bullock Clooney is a bona fide movie star He brings charisma and gravitas to nearly every role he takes He plays the grizzled veteran so well The story he tells at the start of the film makes me feel like I was there in space with them It sucked me into his character and placed the tension high I could watch a whole film with his character just telling stories Bullock plays the rookie medical examiner on her first mission Even not being a fan of hers you get why she s an Oscar winning actress She goes through a range of emotions throughout the film that any less of an actress would haves failed early But Cuaron makes sure we are on board with these characters before it hits the fan What makes the film standout for me is the tension I had the ending spoiled for me two weeks before I got to the sit down with the film By the end of the film my nerves were shot and my hands clammy That s what I call captivating your audience The film looks so vivid and smooth Cuaron is auteur and we should all celebrate his being on this planet I can t wait for this man to take over the world with his film I could only imagine what he could do with the horror drama or a superhero film I m still blown away about what a fantastic piece of art this film was,8

11 October 2013,Nerve Wracking and Thrilling Cinematic Experience,Philosophy Space is Scary out there no one can even hear you scream There is no air no medium for sound to travel on it s just deadly silence and infinite darkness of the vastness of the universe which neither has a beginning nor an end and if you ever get stranded in such a place with nothing but your relentless desire to live and never ending urge to keep moving no matter how grim the chances are for survival remember one thing and one thing only the force that keeps pulling you down obstinately is the force which makes you walk this earth also and no matter how strong the force is we rise walk run and conquer Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity is an ode to the stubborn human instinct for survival the unflinching desire to hold on to life even when death seems imminent which is shown in the most magnificent and intricate way possible It is one epic of a movie which only comes out as often as Halley s Comet It is a well directed well written and marvelously enacted action drama which uses more body language and sound design to express emotions than any movie I have seen in a long time Story When a group of astronauts fixing a damaged device on a satellite are bombarded with a debris of destroyed Russian Satellite orbiting the earth at a speed of a bullet which creates a chain reaction by destroying whatever comes in their way and taking it along disaster strikes on the US Team Members killing everyone except two out of which one detached from the spaceship is left floating in the ever expanding space with limited O2 oxygen and no communication with earth There is no one to hear them cry no one to send help There is this limitlessness and two specs of hope hovering around in enormity Direction Alfonso Cauron has possibly made one of the most engrossing space movies of all time which is dramatic cinematic and enigmatic but not because of the exceptionally realistic 3D effects or the awesome CGI but because of the detailed portrayal of human emotions on screen which is perfectly balanced by a great background score His attention to detail is evident from the way he has recreated every single object hovering around in the gravity lessness from the Ping Pong bats on Chinese space ships to realistic movements in zero gravity everything has been researched thoroughly which add to the viewing experience Performances George Clooney as Matt Kowalski is incredibly sharp and witty as always He makes an impression rather inscribes a character in our mind so deep that It will be remembered for a long time But as the story is one woman s journey for survival Sandra Bullock steals the show by giving one of the best performances of her lifetime She is extremely convincing with her body movements and passes across a lot of emotions without words or expressions She s so good that she might even steal this year s Oscars for it Background Score Steven Price has created a sound track which is incredibly outstanding and gives an ethereal experience to the viewer s emphasizing on the mood of the movie Price may not have been present physically in the movie but his contributions to the movie being so impactful are so much that it s hard to imagine Gravity without Price s soundtrack Final Word Gravity is not only a technical masterpiece but also a nerve wracking and thrilling cinematic experience which like wine will become better and better with time It fuses exemplary sound design great storytelling and out of the world CGI 3D technology to create a marvel No excuse can justify missing it Overall Rating 4 5 5,9
11 June 2016,Not flawless but stunning!,You have to see this movie on the big screen otherwise it s boring and non satisfying In my opinion that s just nonsense Of course the experience is better but even though I didn t get the chance to see it in theater I was still stunned when I saw it at home for the first time First of all let s get to the overall plot A team of astronauts are out in space to repair the Hubble telescope when a Russian satellite is getting hit by a rocket and now wreckage of this satellite is about to collide with them After that the only goal of everyone who survived this accident is to get back to earth alive Gravity isn t a Science Fiction movie it s more of a nerve racking thriller The main characters are played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who both do an excellent job but this flick isn t outstanding because of the great acting or the story it s the superior technical level this movie is on Whether you talk about sound which of course isn t always around as you are in space so the most of the time you just listen to the powerful soundtrack the impressive visuals when thousands of pieces of metal fly by you or just the camera movement by Emmanuel Lubezki who won several Oscars for a good reason In the first few minutes you get to see a very long shot which really involves you into the catastrophic events Even when you are just at home lying on your couch you feel sick in the stomach when crew members are tumbling around It s really rare that I can feel for the characters that much as in Gravity which gets supported by POV point of view shots here and there That s why I don t get why a lot of people are complaining about this movie being boring as he doesn t let you breathe a lot during the short run time of 91 minutes The only concern I got with the film is a very clich turning point within the movie but I don t want to spoil things here so I ll just leave you with that This aspect gets easily dubbed by all the other great things I mentioned In the end Gravity isn t just a movie it s more of an experience you should witness Don t get turned off by people complaining about watching the movie at home although a big TV and some good headphones or a surround system are recommendable Overall it s not perfect but definitely worth a watch,
7 October 2013,Cuarón's Dazzling Space Odyssey Turns into a Cathartic Journey of the Human Spirit,The irony of the film s title is that there isn t any gravity that is but that s not to say it lacks gravitas It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent It s been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar n s last film 2006 s emotionally propulsive thriller Children of Men which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse Somehow the less than prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes Although Ang Lee effectively used 3 D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of Life of Pi I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar n does here within the dramatic structure of the story Co written with his son Jon s the screenplay by contrast is life size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon at times poetic This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen minute sequence that opens the film It s a bravura piece of cinema by anyone s standards In brief bio medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U S Space Shuttle Explorer Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive It s enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home If you don t count the voiceovers at the beginning there are only two actors who make up the entire cast and they are grade A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story s most critical points He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character s life affirming bravado He also impressively wrote the scene Even so this is Sandra Bullock s film from start to finish and it amazes me how she wasn t even among the top casting choices for the role Angelina Jolie turned it down twice Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted Bullock offers her natural likability as a necessary counterbalance However that observation short changes her stellar work here especially the pure physicality of her performance Intriguingly her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in While You Were Sleeping in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure Regardless this is Cuar n s towering cinematic achievement and the movie truly stands on its own,10

24 March 2014,Gravity,A technical masterpiece proved at the Oscars that Alfonso Cuar n brings to us The story is very simple a medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in orbit Life in space is impossible This sentence proves itself in the movie it s obviously very dangerous to work in space reparing satellites and to land on the moon but we did it It all seemed to be good until a Russian satellite is hit by a missile on purpose by the Russians to destroy it but the debris of it end up hitting on Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney After the first hit the timer is set the debris will come and they ll have to be prepared The plot is pretty straight forward but the way they pull it off is brilliant The character development was really good Ryan had a daughter once but she died very young because of a stupid accident and at some points in the movie you understand why she would give up her life to reunite with her lost child or simply to give up because no one will care we can see that she is a lonely person affected by tragic events Matt gives the idea of a experienced and very calm astronaut much like Clooney s usual characters but we don t know much about him except some stories he s always talking about But it s OK the main character really is Ryan it s her character that s important to this movie and like Cuar n said at the Oscars Sandra Bullock is Gravity At some points in the movie without noticing I found myself holding my breath in certain moments It s a claustrophobic movie That good The change between sound and no sound is brilliant that s why I did that along with the change I would hold my breath to experience the same as they would In terms of sound mixing like I said it was well done with the sound matching the experience of the movie Excellent visual experience beautiful images of the earth and surroundings a real breakthrough in special effects and personally the best movie yet in 3D This is absolutely worth seeing in 3D in fact it s necessary to obtain the full movie experience Cuar n and everyone involved in the movie should be proud of themselves,9
8 March 2014,Another marketing fake,Let s start off directly critically acclaimed with 8 2 rating Since I can t vouch for mental credibility of critics I can vouch that they have been properly paid just like for other big titles Now a bit more detail Movie isn t bad There can be worse certainly Movie has visuals some music some acting some plot If watching this is not an expense to you it s worth it However there is nothing to expect from this movie Absolutely The only possible positive thing about this movie is the atmosphere Duh a movie about atmosphere has atmosphere Well better than the opposite To some it may be boring and redundant but I can more or less understand the purpose of depicting how helpless a person is in open space This is the catch of the movie and it is achieved At this point the movie COULD in fact have 7 8 rating But The amount of stupidity in this movie can only be competing against Promotheos How did this specialist get in space Last time I checked space program isn t some university teaching You can t just be an expert or specialist Unless all of that is an urban myth only people with perfect health physical condition mental stability proved by multiple tests and extreme perception are allowed to actually go there And that is regardless of your role And it is for the very reason that things that are shown in the movie do NOT end like they did What do we see Well mentally unstable physically slender expert who has issues in basic centrifuge situation and that IS one of the tests Oh and I hope this isn t much of a spoiler but apparently she also has never succeeded in emergency simulations We are supposed to believe that she was allowed up there On top of that the dialogues are very plain The whole movie can be summed down to protagonist whining and being babysat by her officer in charge Twice in the movie the protagonist stays on the brink of death for unnaturally long time Let s put it this way Over the course of 10 minutes the Oxygen amount has been reduced from 10 to 1 In the next 15 minutes of active talking breath and moving this 1 is as good as full Seriously no Just no And of course there is one decompression scene that is worse than Ripley in Aliens If you are a visual fa fan you will probably award it 7 9 as you d do to any other CGI motion picture If you are a scientific person well you will be offended Totally This is probably not the safe movie to watch,5

8 April 2022,A Beautifully Directed Space Adventure,Before watching this movie officially the first time I have heard from a lot of people this is supposed to be one of the best movies of the 2010 decade and brings visuals to a whole new level After watching it for myself now I can understand all the praise Gravity may possibly be the most exciting and amazingly crafted space movie ever created The survival story is engaging Even for a sci fi film I was never bored once This is incredibly directed featuring some of the most beautifully crafted visuals and cinematography used for a movie The characters may have a few but fit well for a movie about being lost in space And the most interesting I find about this movie is how sometimes it is hard to be an astronaut Sure the idea of traveling the universe sounds a lot of fun But trust me you never know if there s ever going to be rough gravity This is a movie I highly recommend for Sci Fi fans space enthusiasts and even fans of movies with 3D visuals This is probably the best Sci Fi film in recent years And I m glad this won for best director because this is one of the most beautifully crafted films I ve seen,10

10 October 2013,"Side-Effects to Gravity includes shortness of breath, elevated heartrate, and pure visual stimulation",And you think your job sucks Containing some of the most claustrophobic space action since Alien Gravity is a very tense and visually stimulating movie that contains some of the best usage of special effects in film within the past several decades In a fashion similar to 2001 A Space Odyssey dialogue takes a backseat and all focus is on the imagery involving a struggle within the cold harsh world of outer space Every once in a while comes a movie that upon first viewing you become sure that it is going to nab every technical Oscar of the year Terminator 2 Titanic The Matrix Inception and Avatar comes into mind Gravity falls into the same grouping because of its flawless usage of sound camera work and special effects Similar to how Jurassic Park shaped the way we see and hear dinosaurs on film Gravity will be sure to do the same to outer space With this film outer space isn t just a backdrop it is a true living breathing environment that deserves to be respected and feared Without revealing too much Gravity follows two astronauts as they struggle to survive within the boondocks of planet Earth when impending danger starts approaching their workspace While the addition of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock doesn t exactly enhance the movie their performances were quite good But the best performance is that of Alfonso Curason whose mix of close ups intense shots elongated scenes and astounding visual details makes this easily one of the best directing efforts in the past few years The half decade spent on this production pays off and it clearly shows why it took so long However this movie s Hollywood mannerisms definitely hindered this from becoming a bonafide instant classic to the tune of 2001 although I am in the minority and feel like Kubrick s space opera is a rather overrated work Not seeing this in 3 D it is obvious that some of the details in the movie were done less to move the plot and exercise the technical details and more because it was going to be released in 3 D and wanted to hand moviegoers its money s worth Then there s the rather overbloated overproduced and overdramatic musical score done by a Doing My Best Hans Zimmer Impression Steven Price Against Hollywood wishes the movie could have excelled even more relying purely on sound effects and lack of similar to No Country For Old Men Despite the two small gripes that prevent it from being a new age Star Wars Alien or other sci fi outer space masterpieces Gravity is nonetheless a spectacular work of suffocating intensity that leaves you breathless throughout the merciful runtime of 90 minutes Like the best visual works in film history this is best enjoyed in the theater in front of a massive screen surrounded by darkness In a year lacking of Best Picture quality films so far Gravity stands tall as the first great movie of the fall season Just be prepared to take deep breaths This movie will take them away,9
27 April 2014,Lots of Physics but No Chemistry,I ve heard that this one should only be seen in an IMAX theater which seems like sound advice Effects that must be amazing in 3D like the big scene stealing Mexican frog in the splashdown sequence are just distracting on a smallish home screen Worse than that it s a movie that feeds the eye and starves the brain the green screen wizardry is compelling but it doesn t begin to make up for the deficiencies of plot and character development Even two charismatic pros like Clooney and Sandra Bullock can t do much to hoist this damp petard my wife bailed after twenty minutes or so pronouncing it guy stuff and I was all like Wait wait I have a feeling this routine jeopardy plot s about to turn into a Kubrickian fantasy of death and transfiguration It did but that still didn t help much Watchable but disappointing,6
23 October 2013,Best 3D movie to date !!,Went to see this on a XD screen and was blown away with the visuals and sound Not even Avatar in 3D was this good Avatar has aged pretty bad in just 4 years the characters now look cartoonish Note that this movie like Avatar in his time were meant to be seen at the theater in 3D Seeing this type of movies in 2D or at home just makes them average This is what 3D in cinemas was meant for only for movies who really justify and enhance the experience not just to make more money out of sales of 3D tickets The use of 3D helps you feel the action and emotion in this film so do yourself a favor and watch GRAVITY in 3D while still in theaters to get the full immersive effect You re in for an amazing ride,10
22 August 2021,This story gave me more appreciation for gravity.,I watched this movie at the neighborhood movie theater about 8 years ago I remember I fell asleep while watching this movie because of the space dark screen That is why I don t remember the story well so I ve watched it again this time Speaking from the conclusion I have to say this movie is absolutely amazing I have always wanted to go to space and I wanna meet other planet aliens but after watching this movie I completely changed my mind Www This story gave me more appreciation for gravity Without air we hardly live I just want to appreciate gravity air and beautiful global BTW Sandra Bullock is really great actor She is so real and she never overreacting that why I love her And the scene that George Clooney gave up living is so painful This movie made us to go another dimension Highly recommended,8
7 October 2013,Nice images only,Spoilers Every IMAXX documentation on space is more thrilling than this flick I was soo happy when it was over and I didn t have to listen to Sandra Bullock s wheezing no more and Clooney was as boring as usual I can give only one point for the Earth images one point for the ISS crash half a point for space floating half a point for the dream the only realistic action of this movie And that s it And then I go on and wonder a Why the astronaut did not learn techniques to calm herself b Why the commander did not try to rescue himself as long as the chance was given and pull himself in when they were tangled in the ribbon of the chute c Why didn t the other one realizing that the ribbons start to loosen use her other leg to wrap them around,3
17 October 2013,"A stunning, game-changing, cinematic achievement.",OK so I m supposed to be working right now but I m in one of those funky ass quasi writer s block ruts where I ve written one of my characters into a corner and now can t decide whether to solve the problem or just scrap 8 minutes of screen time Until I do here s a few quick thoughts about Gravity which my girlfriend and I went and saw on a day date yesterday afternoon I m not writing this to be read by anybody mind you Rather it s my attempt to distract myself by writing something entirely unrelated to my script in the hopes a solution to my problem pops up when I m not thinking about it Feel free to adopt this perspective in your own situation the next time your boss tells you you re screwing around You re welcome So Gravity Yeah WOW I suppose the simplest way to sum up this film is to say it is indeed a truly new experience In his autobiography Charlie Chaplin recalled when he first saw Lumi re s Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat 1895 which simply showed a steam engine approaching a station To him and millions it was magic Such is the case here with what I refer to as director Alfonso Cuaron s cinematic Thriller a singular evolution of storytelling that he or anyone else for that matter is exceedingly unlikely to repeat in my lifetime Story wise though Gravity is just your typical survival film which has been made aplenty though the elements are different in this setting with only a few broken spacecrafts and endless deep space Survival films like Gravity are almost like one off events something that everyone should see at least once but don t often stand the test of time The allure of a movie like 127 Hours was to see how James Franco would cut off his arm but can anyone remember the rest of the movie And does anyone care to Fortunately Gravity does have more going for it than most survival films which primarily is the various layers of fear the fear of the unfamiliarity of space the obvious fear of time and finally the fear of not just dying but the question of how will your end come A question I m dealing with now in this unconscionable bitch of a script I m trying to finish I should add But more importantly if you re anything like the film homer I am Gravity is much more than a formulaic story of survival it is an exquisite work of visual art Unlike the 3 D technology so overly hyped in Avatar the fact that the screen is so lacking in clutter and action only serves to immerse you in the film Such was the promise of 3 D IMAX years ago finally fulfilled here The 3 D is so seamless and natural there were moments when I had to remove my glasses for a moment if for nothing else than to confirm that yes a 3 D camera angle of a girl in a lake shot from water level is frighteningly realistic Frighteningly realistic That would also sum up this film were it not for the fact that a mere moment after walking out of the theater I was overcome with such emotion I cried As of this minute I still have no concrete explanation for my reaction except to speculate that while Gravity is by no means as great a film as Citizen Kane Casablanca or To Kill A Mockingbird my favorite movie of all time it is arguably the most beautiful cinematic experience I ve ever been fortunate enough to have One last thing I promise Perhaps the most ironic and tragic aspect of Cuaron s game changing achievement is that part of what makes Gravity so singularly wonderful is precisely why it isn t likely to find much success once the IMAX well has run dry I for one will never deign to see this film in any venue smaller than six stories That d be akin to going to the stadium to see your team play Game 7 of the World Series only to sit in your car and listen to it on the radio See this but only as it was meant to be seen OK now back to work before the Hammer comes out here and tears me a new one,10

18 November 2013,Truly Magical,Every once in awhile a movie comes along that reminds you to believe in possibility 3D film was developed so that visionary filmmakers like Alfonso Cuar n could make movies like Gravity Quite simply it is a groundbreaking jaw dropping experience of visual beauty and vicarious terror that leaves you breathless What I liked This is not the transcendent wonder of Kubrick s 2001 This is a physical and visual encounter with cinema For the record I love 3D movies but not for the sake of it I enjoy new ideas being translated through a relatively new facet of technology Gravity left me feeling as though I knew what it would be like in space and that is no small feat Cuar n and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have given us a visual story that previously was beyond my imaginative scope Just brilliant What I didn t like As with most ground breaking films what Cuar n was trying to accomplish cinematically overshadowed character and dialogue This is a rare exception where it s okay with me The movie is not about Bullocks back story The movie is entirely in the moment and succeeds as such Bullock and Clooney are commendable and convincing but their familiar faces within this magical moment of experiencing something new in film for me was almost distracting or a disappointing reminder that it was just a movie http canyoutellastory wordpress com 2013 11 14 gravity 2013,9
20 October 2013,Lacks just about everything that makes a film great.,This movie was simply awful The only redeeming aspects of this movie was the CG and some of the cinematography It lacked story character development and basically everything else that goes into making what generally qualifies as a great movie Gravity was just an excuse to naturally take advantage of 3D where as other movies have forced 3D moments that are out of place In space though almost any moment can be made into a 3D moment and feel natural Also if your easily nauseated you ll want to sit this one out or sit at the very rear of the theater The constant spinning of objects people and camera shots will make you sick After seeing the trailer to this film I had no intentions of spending my hard earned money to go see this My girlfriend decided she wanted to go because her brother said it was an amazing film and she would pay if I went with her So of course I went like a schmuck and figured with low expectations the film couldn t get any worse I was wrong I constantly found myself looking at the remaining time Even she apologized for taking me to the film and said she would never trust her brother again If your a Bullock Clooney CG 3D nut then this movie was meant for you Outside of that this film lacks everything that makes a film great or worthy of such reviews ratings its currently receiving At most I d say this film was in the 6ish range but gave it a 1 simply to curve all these phony ratings,1

25 December 2013,Worst movie of 2013,I don t know what to say only that I regret to watching this movie Good graphics Mediocre acting The worst camera constantly changed positions in a way that gave me headache The poor script with a expected ending Errors form geographical technical or physical point Well what I don t understand is clearly why this movie has such a good rate Probably it s the advertising like with The Dark Knight Rises where the advertising is very strong and the kiddos blindly give it a high rate Anyway this truly wins the title WORST MOVIE OF 2013,1
18 April 2021,Yes and no,The movie has amazing visual aspects And the amount of effort put into making it so visually outstanding The filming techniques are incredible a real must see The storyline was good especially during the early part of the film but started to fall apart towards the end Pity really seeing as so much effort has gone into making this movie It is well worth watching if only for the special effects,8
9 March 2014,Over-hyped and underwhelming,I really don t get why this film has rave reviews OK there are some neat special effects and a few head spinning moments but I was expecting to be blown away instead i spent most of the film irritated by Bullocks character and annoyed by how much of the storyline has been borrowed from films like Apollo 13 The ending was all too predictable and left me thinking this was a wasted opportunity to to let the audience walk away with questions to answer rather than a neat wrap up Massively disappointed Perhaps if i watched it purely for the visual effects i would feel differently but i was hoping to be engaged on other levels as well,2

24 February 2020,Relativity Disappointing,What goes up must come down and this film certainly let me down rather uncomfortably after exciting considerable anticipation Plotwise an incredible piece of utter bunkum that would have graced a b movie of yore jarred conspicuously with a parred down aesthetic and a lean narrative style Having two major Hollywood a list stars leading proceedings prevented any sense of impersonality and this could sort of really be happening suspension of disbelief on my part Which again proved incompatible with the obviously earnest and resolute direction and tone Also such obviously incongruous co orbitals as the NASA Space shuttle already retired with great fanfare a live Hubble repair mission similarly publicly discontinued its on its own now with the I S S and the Chinese multi module space station not yet built as of February 2020 further dented my interest in this realistic film Realistic or realism as a crucial value of this film was fatally undermined for me by all of the above considerations Almost every conceit of the film was beyond any sustained credit for example a mission scientist realistically dealing with the return space craft was an odd point to insist that we accept The travel between and arrival at each space station was equally comic book ish I found one plot conceit to be utterly bewildering however and that was the radio message conversation with a non English speaker on Earth I can not accept that no ground based space agency certainly not NASA would have failed to attempt this method of communication with possibly living astronauts of theirs within the situation of events depicted in Gravity Preposterous is the best categorisation for this very notion All taken together I was unimpressed by Gravity in the round and as much as I can complement some individual facets as a whole it is much less than the sum of its parts Those positives include fair work from the two leading actors Good production design and impressive practical effects work A clear albeit incoherent inconsistent and self contradictory creative vision Therefore I rate at 4 10 where many features are highly commendable but the film as a whole delivers the highest of bunkum almost ripe from the fruitiest of early twentieth century science fiction literature let alone mid century b movie madness and this creates a tonal mess of a movie which defies believability and frustrates enjoyment accordingly,4
22 January 2023,"""A stunning visual experience that will leave you breathless"" - ""Gravity"" review",Gravity is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film that tells the story of two astronauts played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who are stranded in space after their shuttle is destroyed The film expertly balances intense action and suspense with moments of quiet contemplation and reflection The performances of Bullock and Clooney are both outstanding with Bullock in particular delivering a powerful and nuanced portrayal of a woman struggling to survive in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds The film s special effects are truly breathtaking immersing the audience in the harsh and unforgiving environment of space Overall Gravity is a masterful film that showcases the talents of its cast and crew to great effect It is a must see for fans of action science fiction and compelling storytelling,8
10 December 2013,What a load of old *&£$@! ass!,What a load of codswhallop I waited for months to see this movie and was swept along by all of the rave reviews 10 minutes in and I had already counted more preposterous flaws and scientific absurdities than I was any longer able to keep track of The acting is wooden one dimensional and utterly juvenile Bullock is an emotional and physical wreck almost from the first instant she is technically inept sullen and devoid of professionalism or any very redeeming qualities whatsoever She is nothing at all that you would expect of an astronaut She doesn t so much just not have the right stuff rather she appears to have no stuff whatsoever In fact one could say her performance was such a howler so to speak that there are junctures in the movie where it becomes utterly comedic To make things worse strong comparisons can be drawn between Clooney s character and Toy Story s Buzz Lightyear the only difference in this case being that Buzz produces a much more convincing likable and less plastic performance than Clooney If you like big ass old CGI induced explosions vacuous performances and sci fi movies that are utterly devoid of any of the sci component at all then this is undoubtedly the movie for you In space it seems no one can see you create drivel The sad thing is that with the utterly inexplicable high reviews and rave ratings this movie has received Hollywood will only continue to pump out more dross like this and in so doing will only continue to contribute to the dumbing down of science among the general public overall Basically if you like bad comic books never progressed beyond junior level science and did pretty badly in this like huge pointless CGI explosions enjoy 2D juvenile uninspirational characters backed up by clueless uninspirational acting and juvenile one dimensional dialogue even though they use 3D special effects to no meaningful purpose beyond a pointless visual spectacle for the spectacularly uniformed then this is exactly the movie for you For those with even a modicum of scientific background intelligence and taste I suggest you do a search on Google for all the bad science in Gravity the Movie I used to trust IMDb ratings But that s twice in a row now I have duped into watching movies with off the scale IMDb ratings the other being Prisoners where plot line acting and everything about the movie was so abysmally bad it almost beggared belief There must just be an awful lot of non scientists out there Cluelessness abounds,1
13 October 2015,Space Junk,To buy that Sandra bullock is some sort of brain in this or any film is a stretch This film is filled with annoying dialogue and what are all of these reviews about the flawless CGI and spectacular scenery Even if one could say they are great which they really aren t they cannot make up for the story writing which is just appalling A bunch of unlikely events are stringed together with a group of space walkers using drills to tighten and loosen screws who act like they re going for a walk in the park even when I sit at my desk at work I m more careful Yes there will come a time when being out in space will perhaps be an accepted state but one would remain in a relative state of awareness at the threat that surrounds their mortality to be clowning around as Clooney and the space loons are is just utterly implausible Go and watch Moon or Interstellar or Martian This film is utter rubbish I just had to stop this movie so I wouldn t waste any more of my oxygen wishing that Sandra bullock would run out of hers,1

4 October 2013,A visual achievement and an inspiring masterfully crafted tale,When I entered the cinema I didn t expect to see a triumph in cinematography Gravity is hands down the best movie of this year it is fascinating majestic and thoroughly dreadful at the same time The visual is years ahead from the flock as the screenplay are probably the smoothest use of continuous shots I ve ever seen Acting from the talented Sandra Bullock and George Clooney is incredibly beautiful the simple concept of characters in dire predicament has been crafted so masterfully it s nigh impossible not to be drawn into this highly inspiring tale The visual is undeniably breathtaking It flows stunningly from scene to scene the camera shows just the right angle while explosion of color in dark space erupts The occasional switches to first person view looks very natural emphasizing the intense solitude almost in frightening yet utterly captivating way Graphical effect is clearly one of the best not only in movie but in all medium it is gloriously magnificent to witness such stellar value It takes its time to build up the suspense and it focuses comprehensibly on the extraordinary moments while giving the audience a chance to savor them entirely I truly admire Alfonso Cuar n from his work in Children of Men he s a visionary and now he s perfected his craft with excellent editing and screenplay Screenplay does a marvelous job of trailing the characters in the gripping struggle for survival Credits goes to the short list of cast George Clooney who is charmingly dependable and especially Sandra Bullock who deliver a chilling intimate performance that can freeze the entire theater She s nothing less than remarkable she seems a bit withdrawn at first but as she fights through the ordeal she gradually opens up and ultimately exhibits strengths beyond despair This is one of rare occasions where a movie almost exclusively relies on an individual s acting and Sandra Bullock delivers many times over taking the audience along in her personal journey A truly inspiring performance The music is harrowingly gripping almost to the extent of merging with the sound effect It gives enchanting suspense and even more emotionally engaging at most points When the visual music and acting combine together it reaches a pinnacle of how passionately powerful a movie could be Its simple yet brilliant concept of living can be universally acceptable to everyone it speaks to viewers across age gender or race There may come movies that stand above the rest movies that can restore wonder upon watching them as if you are experience watching big screen for the first time they may not come often but Gravity is clearly one such movie With such elegant visual choreograph and splendid acting it s a near magical experience,10

10 January 2014,Very disappointed,I rarely write reviews but just because the critics in Belgium and worldwide were unanimously ridiculously enthusiastic I just feel the moral obligation of putting people back on their feet They made it feel like the movie of the century it felt like the Jurassic Park of space movies And as a die hard sci fi lover I really wanted to love this film but sadly enough it now feels as cheap marketing gibberish The graphics and audio are very good Obviously But just like Transformers amazing cgi can t make up for a b d movie The story and whole movie actually failed me on every possible level Without going into some pretty obvious mistakes the story simply doesn t connect it doesn t grow on me It feels like just a chain of events with very simple flat dialogs and no real build up or climaxes It s short it s simple Not only that but it s actually a very sad overstatement to say this one of the most realistic space movies out there as I m constantly trying NOT to point out some big flaws to my wife so she would not completely be disappointed That said I kind of like Bullock in most of her movies A nice unpretentious simple girl can only score in my opinion but my wife and I were constantly annoyed with her clumsiness lack of hurry even while breathing co lack of courage lack of education as an astronaut and so forth But I guess that s a bad character script in stead of a bad actress She felt to me like what Jaden Smith does to most of his recent movies which Is why i decided never to waste my time on him again Anything but award winning if you ask me But who am I Watch the movie because society forces you I don t care but this is the last time I rely on IMDb ratings and real Movie critics Now it has 8 8 but in a year it will be down to 7 5 mark my words,1
5 July 2014,Poor Plot,For a film that won seven Oscars I expected quite a bit Unfortunately the movie ended up being boring and utterly slow paced The movie was not scary or suspenseful as I anticipated it to be While it was visually stunning in some parts everything else was impressive This movie follows Dr Ryan Stone played Sandra Bullock and veteran astronomer Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney on their mission in space which quickly becomes ill fated when their space craft is destroyed and their crew ends up getting killed They must take the matters into their own hands to survive as they re stranded adrift in space The movie had very little to the plot as it was slow paced the acting was okay at least by Sandra Bullock and there is wasn t much emotionality to the story nor was there any tension to the film at least after the beginning The film didn t give me the spine chilling feels that the characters have Overall the film was NOT terrible but it wasn t what I was looking for,4
4 December 2019,Wow,Gravity is one of these rare movies I thought there must be a 2nd version out there in cinema A version which is visually that impactful tense and simply that amazing everybody keeps saying But no it s not There s no OMG at any point of the endless floating and heavy breathing no thrill nothing memorable for me just a black sea of nothing I guess I ll take my beloved one and a picknick blanket and make myself comfortable under the actual sky,1
6 August 2023,"10 years ago I cried while watching this movie, 10 years later I also cried watching it",This movie is very special to me not only because I have a love for the universe but also because I accidentally watch it when I go through uncomfortable experiences in real life this movie has encouraged me in one way or another I was really impressed by Sandra s acting she was great and the detail of the story I was amazed When I watch the movie I feel like I m in the real universe And the best thing about this movie the music I will give a huge round of applause to the music of this movie Too emotional I ll probably forever remember the scene where the pieces of the spaceship caught fire and flew towards the ground in the blue sky with the bg music of Gravity just Wow,9

18 October 2013,You end up counting your breath!!!,When I first saw the trailer of GRAVITY there was just one thought that was running in my mind I am not going to miss this movie at any cost Well and I did keep my word and finally today I went and watched the much awaited movie of the year at least for me it was For people who think that a movie should have an ensemble cast try this one You are sure to be in short of words and you are sure to redefine cinema GRAVITY begins with the magnificent and the breathtaking literally view of the mind boggling space that we have seen only on NASA footage and other documentaries The view positively gives you the wish to join a space research organization The silence will make you fall in love with it and the darkness will make you fall in love with the loneliness You are introduced to Matt George Clooney Ryan Sandra Bullock and Shariff Phaldut Sharma physically As an Indian I also liked the Hindi song Shariff hums for a moment It is all going well until a Russian missile gets released and the entire mission and their Hubble Telescope are hit and thrashed into pieces Will all the three survive Do they have a way for survival when the three are not even etched to each other Will Ryan make it when her oxygen levels are falling rapidly GRAVITY is surely one of the best movies made in the year For a common man who does not understand the technical or the scientific aspects of the real astronomical world this is a real breathtaking adventure When Sandra Bullock counts each of her breath we realize the importance of the air and the amount of oxygen we take for granted When George Clooney says sip like a wine and not beer you are drawn into a reality wherein we realize that we are privileged of many things As we progress with the film the fact sinks in that there is not much of a conversation in the movie the script writers have definitely saved some papers regarding that which makes it even more special The close up shots take us through the journey of Ryan so closely that we start seeing everything being her There is not a moment in the movie where you feel drifted away from the story or take your eyes off from the screen With less dialogues and more to convey through actions I give it to the entire cast and crew of the movie And specially take a bow Alfonso Cuaron the director of the movie for making this master piece look so real and believable What shall I say about Sandra Bullock and and George Clooney Can I put all the affirmative adjectives for their brilliant performances As I write this I still have a heavy lump in my throat I am not that much of an emotional person when it comes to movies But this I must say is a definitely not a miss movie If you had not watched it yet do not make any plans for this weekend and just go for it You will not regret this one,
4 October 2013,"Believe the Hype, it's that Good!",What more can be said about director Alfonso Cuaron s masterpiece Gravity that hasn t already been written by almost every single other person that writes about movies on the planet In the film Sandra Bullock portrays Dr Ryan Stone a first time astronaut on a routine space mission that turns to disaster when she is disconnected from her space shuttle by space debris It s one of those amazing films that has you thinking the whole time How did they do that The combination of the real with the computer generated is so seamless that you can never tell what s physical and what isn t because it all looks so real To say that this film lives up the hype would be an understatement so as I sit here writing adding to the neverending parade of noise surrounding this film I figured I d take an atypical approach with this review I m going to sum up what I thought about Gravity in a game of word association rather than going into depth on the story and how emotionally powerful it is on all of the base human emotions from fear to a will to live because otherwise I could keep writing all day long So without anymore preamble here s what I really thought of Gravity Space Beautiful Alfonso Genius Sandra Phenomenal Disaster Suspenseful Humanity Triumphant Oscar Guaranteed I give Gravity a 10 out of 10,10

28 February 2022,"Thrilling, Exciting, and Emotional all in one",First off let me just say that Gravity deserves the enormous amount of Oscars it got The amount of Oscars it got for very different parts of the movie represents how the Gravity crew made sure every aspect of the movie was top notch I m going to go ahead and talk about some of those aspects Acting The only actor and actress Gravity depended on are Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and this movie REALLY depends on their performance I m just going to say that it s a good thing Gravity had to depend on these two actor and actress because they are amazing at their job Space Action The CGI music and camera angles really put together a thrilling intense and realistic action scenes The action scenes are truly mesmerizing and epic The CGI makes the zero gravity very realistic along with space and the action scenes The music contributes gorgeously to the tenseness thrills and emotion And I just want to say that this is one of few movies that actually got me thinking about camera angles and that s definitely for a reason Thrills Definitely a tense and thrilling movie The zero gravity action idea and acting contribute a lot to this Emotion This movie didn t quite make me cry but that doesn t mean I wasn t touched by this movie Definitely some moments that will get you emotional Originality Not a super original idea compared to movies like Inception however the creators of Gravity set this movie up in such a way that no other movie has And that is what makes Gravity original Overall In the end I absolutely love Gravity for all the reasons I ve listed and even more And I don t just hand out 10 10s all the time The movie has to deserve a 10 10 if they want it And for me Gravity deserves its 10 10,9
9 December 2013,Great visuals -- full stop,Visually this movie is remarkable great effects its a technical masterpiece Too bad the same care that went in to how good it looks wasn t taken with the script the story and the dialogue I am not a rocket scientist but that doesn t mean I am a complete dolt Having recently watched an IMAX documentary on repairing the Hubble telescope I learned that they have to take incredible care not to puncture the gloves as even contact with a circuit board could breach them Did the writers not even do a bit of research on this film If its going to be pure fiction why not just give her a transporter then she can beam herself home or better yet a time machine she could go back and save her daughter At about 65 of this movie I could watch no more I really wanted to like this 8 5 out of 10 for reviewers led me to believe it was a good movie Unfortunately I am of the 15 category that couldn t stand this vapid ill conceived piece of tripe,1
4 October 2013,Just Starting to Relax,Space nut here If I wasn t such a coward I would have signed up to go to Mars So I was tense throughout the movie since I read a lot and watch a lot about space the final frontier non fiction and know some of the dangers In addition the way the film is written and directed I felt I knew the characters right from the start so I felt for their plight Slightly teary was I So although physically tensed in my seat and teary eyed I found this a thoroughly enjoyable film And even though I am somewhat well informed I am not informed enough to be distracted by anything that didn t ring true An excellent film with beautiful visuals,10
6 March 2014,A new cinema experience,Alfonso Curon s film is just pure evidence for why we still need and should be going to the cinema It demands to be seen on the biggest 3D IMAX screen you can be find boasting an excellent sound system I wish I avoided the trailers which were essentially extended scenes and went into this one blind The spectacle of this film is wondrous and you find yourself deeply absorbed in the blackness of not only your massive multiplex but in the space the 3D screen provides a window towards The film offers you some of the most incredible imagery you ve ever seen upon the screen intense survival action and great character work Bullock s performance outside of a genre film would be heralded even more than it already is If you didn t see this at IMAX when it came out or the biggest 3D screen you could get to I pity you but then again you were probably told enough to do so I won t be watching this again for a very long time because without the beautiful technology to back it up you re not doing this masterpiece justice I ve never seen anything like this in my life,9
16 July 2017,Outstanding on many levels! 7 Stars from me!,I wonder what it would be like just floating around space without having to overcome dangerous obstacles either being hit by those things coming at ya or bumping into obstacles that aren t moving very fast One cannot truly control the direction of an objects trajectory in space or the manner in which a body will move toward objects in space without proper guidance and focus I thought the movie depicted a pretty good representation of what might occur if lost in space but it still makes me go hmmmm because of fascination The visuals graphics were seriously intense How does one make a movie like this George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock were phenomenal astronauts Zero gravity in space and then full gravity on earth That has to mess with a body s equilibrium some Phew I was nervous for them It seemed so real and reasonable I noticed Sandra Bullock doing a lot of talking to herself as well and that makes it believable Darn I didn t see this movie in 3D IMAX That has to be way more intense The cinematography superb I m interested in the documentary the making of this movie to see everyone s involvement WOW One could ask a lot of questions about this movie in terms of different outcomes for sure Sandra Bullock mentions that one of the space stations is about 100 kilometers away which we all know is about 60 miles and then when George Clooney comes back into the scene he states that it is about 100 miles which is about 40 miles more than Sandra Bullock stated So I got a bit confused Either they messed up about the miles kilometers ratio or Sandra Bullock wasn t heading toward the space station but away from it I got a bit lost in that translation But I only saw it once so far and I could be in the wrong Nonetheless still a movie worth watching in 3D IMAX no less I m wanting the IMAX version here for myself,7

20 November 2013,'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins.,Gravity is about two astronauts who are stranded in space as their space shuttle is destroyed by space debris coming from a destroyed satellite They must struggle to survive and get back to earth before it s too late I have never seen a film quite like this before It s visually stunning and has a very emotional element to it that is hard to ignore I must say lots of tears were flowing from my eyes The cinematography is breathtaking The whole movie felt like I was actually in space with these two astronauts experiencing what they were experiencing as they tried to get back home I saw Gravity in I MAX 3D which is probably the best format to see it in The 3D was perfect and this is coming from a guy who hates 3D There are only a few films I have seen that actually worked in 3D and this definitely tops them all Most of the films setting is in space and I must say the visuals were absolutely astounding Every details of space seemed to have been made to absolute perfection An Oscar for visual effects will be given to this film If it s not I ve lost hope Steven Price s score was the best I ve heard in awhile It s definitely one I d love to listen to on an off day The music really made the movie just that much more emotional Alfonso Cuaron is well known for directed Children of Men and Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban so we know what the man is capable of His talents are put on display more than ever in this film He also wrote the screenplay which is really well written There s only so much you can talk about while in space but the screenplay was perfect with such an emotional impact I ve always had a soft spot for Sandra Bullock She always gets to me whether it would be making laugh or making me cry She knows how to tell an emotional story and make you feel impacted by it Her performance in this was amazing with her ability to make me laugh and cry at the same time I ve never seen anything like this from her before George Clooney was also great in this film He played a calm and more laid back character He has some great one liners as well Gravity will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I m honestly praying it wins The film was visually and emotional breathtaking and is something that shouldn t be missed I was originally not going to see it but decided to take a chance Thank God I did I recommend Gravity to someone who just wants to watch a great film I guarantee you will be in awe throughout the film The runtime is perfect At just an hour and a half you will leave the theatre satisfied I m happy that I m getting to see all these great films Usually I skip out on them to go see the blockbusters I guarantee that won t happen anymore Grade A,10

15 October 2013,Feel the space,GRAVITY My Rating 9 My personal favorite Magical Director Alfonso Cuar n is return after Harry potter the prisoner of Azkaban he did extremely well If you love Space have basic knowledge of physics u can say it common sense also then don t miss the movie otherwise after 2 or 3 months when you will see it on your PC you will defiantly regret that it was a big screen watch Very mature George clooney Chiseled beauty Sandra Bullock done very well to their roles Sandra has noticeable figure at the age of 49 I believe that i am very good in physics i cant find any noticeable mistake salute to Alfonso Cuar n s expertise I recommend 3d version of movie Turn your phone silent refresh your mind put your 3d glasses feel the space,9

6 October 2013,"A Thrilling mix of ""Matrix"" meets ""Inception""",A movie with such a title that is about the scary and dark void called space you d expect to be thrilling Well I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling This film is a perfect combination of Matrix and Inception and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level Gravity is a life time experience that everyone must see If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters it just doesn t get better than that Since this movie has so many genres it s hard to tell its main one This movie has adventure comedy sorrow suspense thrilling scenes intense scary scenes and so much more The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie Sandra Bullock The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope It seems like a casual spacewalk but when she gets stranded away from her ship Explorer she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station If you want to find out how and if she and her co worker Matt Kowalski George Clooney make it back to Earth alive you have to watch the film The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics it s hard not to like it You feel like you are right there experiencing whatever the main characters experience The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it what would you do if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe with nobody but yourself What would your thoughts be Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you The camera work is the best I ve ever seen Alfonso Cuar n I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel She thinks she s stranded Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth she starts to see Matt Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back As soon as his statement is over he s gone She hallucinated him but the plan worked It s a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that s why I like it The movie is rated PG 13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18 I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now I may be wrong but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of Gravity Let s see what happens in 2014 Reviewed by Gerry O KIDS FIRST Film Critic For more reviews by our youth film critics visit kidsfirst org,10
10 December 2013,A new breathtaking experience in Cinema!!!,Being a big fan of Sandra Bullock let me say this one is her best performance so far even better than her Oscar winning role in the blind side The film starts slowly but with very beautiful and breathtaking outerspace scenes and taking it s time to connect us to the main protagonists and developing a sequence of events which are least to say the most breathtaking beautiful thrilling and not to forget horrifying By halftime of the movie i was deeply attached to story and the characters that left me crying non stop A truly revolutionary or redefining the idea of great quality movie making after AVATAR Should not be missed by anyone Easily one of the best of the decade,9
27 November 2013,Absolute Drivel,Down there with the worst films I have ever seen Terrible Nothing more to say really without spoilers If you go I did warn you OK need a few more lines if this is to be published Would have walked out early except that I would have had to come back to pick up my wife Science is bad and unbelievable at least with Armageddon the overall effect was good fun Even avatar which was also drivel had dome reason to empathize with the characters Now if you are willing to pay your ticket price just for some 3D you may think this film is value but its still absolute drivel,1
4 October 2013,The greatest sci-fi since 2001 and easily the best picture of the year!,GRAVITY Alfonso Cuaron s 2nd sci fi undertaking is a masterpiece Beautifully realized fantastically acted and housing the most spectacular special effects ever witnessed on film it is a triumph in the utmost sense Let me start by saying this is the most gorgeous film on a technical level EVER Never have you seen something with this level of awe and spectacle Not once do you doubt the cold depths of space and the mechanized behemoths that our heroes trek across in the 90 minute run time It s this believability that adds to the dread and overall experience You will feel completely exhausted by the time the credits roll both emotionally and mentally Not because there is any real thinking to do but because you feel you re right there in the suit as helpless and lost as our struggling protagonists You are part of the movie and this is magnified perfectly by the best used 3D EVER This is one of the first times other than Life of Pi and Avatar that I insist you see a film in 3D It wouldn t be the same mind blowing experience without it Sandra Bullock and I never thought I would say this since she is one of my least favorite actresses of all time is absolutely perfect as Dr Ryan Stone I will be completely shocked if I don t see her name in the best actress category at the Oscars and unlike her undeserving win for the Blind Side she deserves the spot This is possibly her best performance EVER In fact I ll be routing for her George Clooney doesn t give a lot of presence to the film but I think that s an ideal choice in lending poise and power to Bullocks stellar performance no pun intended This is one of the greatest science fiction films of the past well EVER I know I ve been throwing the word around a lot but I don t often use it so freely It s one of those rare cases and I mean very rare where every aspect of a film deserves the magic word at the end Most technically beautiful film EVER Check One of the most intense and believable films EVER Roger The best film of the year and possibly EVER Copy Houston and luckily we don t have any problems 2 Cox Up WAY UP,10
13 October 2013,I fell for Gravity,For me this was one of the rare movies that lived up to expectations and even went beyond I don t care how the film was made whether it was primarily computers or not I found it an incredible accomplishment I literally sat there with my mouth agape for the majority of the film I don t know how it would play in 2d but in 3d I was actually ducking out of the way at times Only wish I d seen it in IMAX Perhaps the better initiated in rocket science would find fault with the film but it certainly seemed realistic to me and that s all I can ask of a movie The performances were stellar and I felt Sandra Bullock reacted much like one would expect in the situation she d found herself in well except for those of us who would have just completely lost it and tried to swim for home To all involved with this film thanks for the experience,10
14 January 2017,What's with the negative reviews?,I know this review is late but This movie is a masterpiece Why are there a lot of negative reviews Almost everything in this movie is amazing The story is not exactly explained but you find out along the way It s done very well The cinematography is beautiful Alfonso Cuaron has really outdone himself The music is also great and is with suspense This movie makes you think What would I do if I was in this situation Overall this movie is worth being viewed by everyone I extremely recommend watching this masterpiece It s great to watch with anyone really Except with the negative science nerds who point out all the mistakes instead of trying to enjoy the movie,10
25 July 2014,Space gem and treasure,I will not say most but certainly in the top 5 films with the theme of the universe all the time Yes some will say it is easy now with this technology filmed but somewhat without prejudice should watch the movie The scenes are very very impressive Not one of those movies where you brain to pasture at least not to me because I was the whole movie really tense and excited about actions and if that was the goal of Directors I thank him he certainly succeeded This is not just a movie this is an experience the universe at first hand I guess we can not closer and recommendations for every lover of this uncharted expanse that includes yours truly The film was made for 3D and it should be taken care of be sure to look for better 3D experience but generally run from movies where you should wear accessories glasses Bad things in the film are the main actors Bullock and Clooney are not among my prefer the actors to put it mildly However Actress managed and it holds the entire movie Every point of contact with the Odyssey and Alien is coincidental,10
22 October 2013,Gravity Review,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
4 October 2013,The presentation is unlike any I've ever seen (no spoilers here),I really don t like to refer to myself as a movie snob but I do find myself easily annoyed with films that neither challenge me nor respect my intelligence I went to Gravity based on a few strong recommendations but inwardly nervous that I would be disappointed From the first 10 minutes of the film I knew that this was something special I don t need to get into plot points I would only say that this film is not for anyone with a heart condition or a nervous disposition I found this film as visually beautiful as it was jaw grindingly intense In the theater people were so intensely invested in this film that every intended reaction was felt throughout Make no mistake this film was the filmmaker s great achievement absolutely the perfect presentation absolutely the work of an artist Again I don t shed these words for many This was nothing I d ever seen before The closest comparison for me is 2001 A Space Odyssey but not quite It s not as deep and intelligent a movie not as original a premise and not as groundbreaking But these are two different movies and this story couldn t have been presented better,9
14 October 2013,How did this get a 8.7?,I watched this movie with my husband in 3D at an XD theater and was disappointed I m not a huge Sandra Bullock fan but thought it looked good We both thought it was going to be awesome with the high ratings it got I told my husband we have to see it at the theater in 3D it s going to be cool We totally wasted our money and should have waited for it to hit red box This movie needed more action or something Some of the scenes were not possible in a real life situation in space So if you haven t seen it yet I would just wait until it comes out on DVD Your not missing out on anything seeing it in a theater Well maybe the popcorn,5
30 March 2014,Mother Earth,Visually Impressive and the Look is all Shiny and New The Soundtrack also Enhances the Experience both the Music and the Vibrating and Stinging Effects To say that this is a Visceral Film would be Obvious because that is Exactly what it is and any attempt in the Movie to be Otherwise comes across as Corny and Old Fashioned Sandra Bullocks Grieving Mother Syndrome and Her Last Minute Religious Conversion No one taught me to Pray will you say a Prayer for Me George Clooney s Country Western Music and His Golly Shucks Storytelling are all Weathered and Wearisome But this Movie sure has Appeal The Sharp Cinematography is Breathtaking and the Action Impressive and the Suspense Sustainable All of this Beauty is somehow not Brought Down by Bullocks Whining Weeping and Heavy Breathing Mother Earth seems to Dominate the Image and the Conversation Perhaps one of the Reasons that the Film Resonated with Audiences and made it the Hit of the Year with Fans and Critics alike is due to the Ever Present Mother Earth She is Always there in the Background Looking After Her Children and Inviting them to Please come Home where it is Safe On a Subconscious Level this is as Basic as it gets in the Human Response Categories and Mother Earth like all Mothers Everywhere is a Welcome sight for Her Children The Ones in Space and in Theatre Seats,8

18 December 2013,"Saw it in theaters three times, just to make sure it was actually this good.",Let me start by saying that I did not have an interest in seeing this film prior to having a discussion with my coworker about how I don t go to the movies as often anymore because the tickets are so incredibly expensive Said coworker talked me in to spending the 11 50 for an evening student ticket by telling me that the movie was made for my eyes Admittedly the original reason for going was more so the intrigue of gaining insight as to what type of film my coworker thought suited me so well The first five minutes were a little slow for me I groaned inwardly at the opening scene predicting that the movie was going to rely solely on stunning visual effects and come out lacking in significant content Starting minute six I was genuinely amazed It s true the movie does contain some splendid digital effects portraying earth as a luminescent orb hovering nearby with a somewhat omniscient presence however I can assure the movie does not rely on this alone This review does not contain spoilers so I will merely state that as a film deserves every bit of hype it s getting from critics and fans alike Sandra Bullock gives a stunning performance I found it to be raw and charged with the exact type of nerve required for the role The movie is full of symbolism for any fellow lit geeks out there and touches on some really important struggles we all face on an individual level such as letting go of the past and not allowing it to hold us back It has a satisfying ending I think it can be stated confidently that the ending is in fact perfect for the scenario All of this being said I would like to address some criticism I have read on the film First of all the movie does have quite a long run time It could be a bit shorter but this small fact in no way holds it back from being a great film and more importantly a great story Secondly there are events that transpire that break the laws of physics like a baseball bat to an old car window One of the most important skills we can have as viewers is to learn that suspending our disbelief will ultimately lead to our ability to appreciate a good story and film for what it truly is Realistically a good majority of films released these days have elements that could no way happen in real life If you get hung up on things like that you won t every be able to enjoy a good movie The movie deserves the nominations it has received and I think deserves to win them as well Thank you for reading I strongly recommend going to see it,9

15 October 2013,One of the best movies in the era of digital movie-making,Gravity is one of the most groundbreaking movies in digital movie making There I said it Not only is it the first movie to really make me feel like I was in space it used CGI in the best way possible to the point of that for the most part I m not sure what was real or wasn t The movie follows Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock on her first space shuttle mission and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney who is on his final trip to space They are towards the end of the mission until debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite causes mass destruction to be heading their way This is where the movie truly begins It has a slow buildup in the first 20 minutes but then explodes into a thrilling movie Right from the opening shot I could tell this movie was going to be special it was a beautiful wide shot of space as we hear bits of mission control talking to the two characters and it was just great Bullock carries the film with an emotional performance and surprisingly the characters don t actually get overly in depth but you still really care about who they are They don t spend a whole lot of time with exposition with the characters but it almost isn t needed because of just small bits of characterization that help sum up the characters really well The minimalist aspect of characterization works so perfectly for a film like this as danger just keeps provoking them Although the other big star here is the visual effects cinematography and space in general The cinematography is absolutely mind blowing from long slow and beautiful shots of space to tense unnerving close ups on the actors The movie also uses POV shots frequently and they only add to the immersion and tenseness The slow shots are hypnotic and spinning and give the perspective of space unlike anything else before it 3D is utilized great from adding depth to the background or using it as actors reach out to grab something The visual effects of space not only set the bar so high but really truly make everything feel so real In addition the movie seems to call back to other pieces of science fiction such as 2001 A Space Odyssey with a certain shot as well as Bullock being a strong female lead like Sigourney Weaver in Alien which is always fantastic to see Overall Gravity sets the bar so high changing the game for digital movie making has unbelievable effects and cinematography and is without a doubt the best movie of the year thus far if not one of the best in years and absolutely needs to be seen in theaters for the full experience,10
27 February 2014,Heart pounding ridiculous!,Mr Alfonso Cuar n you gotta be kidding me man Next time have a warning written on the posters saying It could give you Gravity level experience for people who don t want to be dumbfounded when they come out of the theater I mean what was the point of me buying recliners for my entire family when you just had to make us sit on the edge of our seats most of the time How many months were you in space with Tim to know how to make the viewers experience extreme thrills I hadn t imagined the risks of being an astronaut who needs to repair satellite systems in space until I watched your movie I m actually short of words to express the amazing visuals you ve put up behind the characters It almost seems a billion dollar project accounting in what NASA must ve spent to help you make a film out there Gravity is next to the real experience of being an astronaut which will literally take your breath away It s a brave new height of quality created by an artist who apart from doing all the research seems to have probably fantasized of being in outer space a lot Normally when people watch effects taking place in a scene they can probably figure out what could really be happening like ropes computer graphics chrome screen etc you know But you ll be so lost in the magnifique of the relative background that the next thing you know you ll be catching your breath after the scene s already happened and you won t have time to think of anything else in the world later It won t give you goosebumps or the chills in your spine but the intensity of the silence itself will reach out to grab you like you really have to be there and then at the same time you re gonna experience A hell of a ride Not to mention the music is a tool in this movie that s going to affect your shock for worse If you know how many categories of academy awards are there let s just say that I won t be surprised if these guys sweep out half of them Alfonso Cuar n Tim Webber Emmanuel Lubezki Steven Price you guys have my standing ovation,10

4 October 2013,"Houston, We Have the Future of Movies",Houston We Have the Future of Movies Assuming the average viewer interested in seeing this film knows what it s about I m going to skip the plot summary albeit brief and jump right into how much I loved this stunning piece of art Director Alfonso Cuar n has a knack for beauty he directed the most magical of all the Harry Potter films recreating the world with a dark splendor his dystopian CHILDREN OF MEN was a cinematic wonderland Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN was so gorgeous in its simplicity and now he creates a quasi horror film set in space that is so dazzling and magnificent a part of you wants to keep drifting aimlessly around the globe The film is a thrill ride with a booming and heart racing score that perfectly coincides with the tempo and action The performances from George Clooney and specifically Sandra Bullock who basically carries the film on her shoulders are strong We are with Dr Stone Bullock every step or floating inch of the way and we don t want to lose contact This is the future of film and when executed the correct way as this film is the thought is beyond exciting The effects are breathtaking but most importantly they re unnoticeable They flow along with the film as easily as Dr Stone does in zero gravity Be warned I wanted to immediately re watch the film as soon as it was over part of me was thankful I was on earth but another part of me was curious to take a trip around space and perhaps get lost in it s beauty And that s just it the film is frighteningly seductive But I don t mind at all Give me more,8
4 January 2014,Great simple movie....,The movie is simply great loved the comment about it being an allegory Not a lot happening in the movie It is plain and simple might be boring for some who do not like the genre but totally worth the journey What bring out the best of the movie are the soundtracks They bring out the emotion of the moments just great Sandra bullock s is excellent after the actor in A Moment to Remember this is the acting that marked me Great play by george clooney also great role The movie might have some scientific and realistic flaws in the view of some but sit back with a clear mind watch and enjoy the ride u will feel it It s undoubtedly worth it Recommend it to everyone,9

4 October 2013,"A Chilling, Heart-Pounding, and Unbelievable ride",Score Disclaimer I want to give this film a 10 but I will wait until I see it again for a second opinion Gravity is an incredible film Absolutely incredible Peerless in direction Gravity features career defining performances from Bullock and Clooney absolutely stunning top notch special effects and incredibly effective drama that brings this seemingly simplistic idea and narrative to life But above all Gravity is the most fantastic space movie ever made Gravity is filled with visual splendor and packed with layers of metaphor and meaning much of which I am still debating with colleagues on I haven t come out of a film for a long while equally blown away and perplexed in a good way of course I love films that are appreciable by both audiences those looking for entertainment Which they will receive in spades and those looking for a film that transcends being a film in the sleekest of ways Other elements of the film are peerless the cinematography is beautiful the minimalist score is effective and the sound design is perfected It s hard to describe my feelings towards Gravity without abusing my positive adjective collection but I ll just say the Gravity is pretty darned close to perfect It s original intense and very entertaining It s also highly re watchable with a purpose it s packed with genius and beauty This is one perilous journey I personally want to experience over and over deciphering it s layers and themes It will forever stick in my memory A one of a kind incredibly exceptional experience Side note 3D usage transcends Avatar and my personal favorite of the summer Pacific Rim It s essential to the experience and proves to be one of the finest in theater experiences ever,9

26 October 2013,Different Feeling!,First I was expecting to see a science fiction movie presenting an out of space travel with several repetitive happenings everyone could expect However when I watched it it was not It was more a philosophical thought incurring in a right place to invigorate the main points of the story While I believe every one was immersed in how every thing could be so strange in a zero gravity I was thoughtful about how lonely one can be whether she is among thousands of people or away from them thousands of miles And then it is the matter of how it all depends on yourself in either case to deal with it and pass it These feeling started to become even more after everyone except her were dead and she was far from every thing with every single different laws of physics affecting her In other words that was a sense of familiar loneliness in a different context The other part of the movie that thrilled me was when she touched the earth soil with a mellow sense of happiness in her face It was not the soil of one particular area of the world That would not matter In that scale that soil was familiar to her That was where she belongs to without thinking of the borders countries and people she might see You might belong to a neighborhood a city a country or a sphere depends on how you look at it,9

2 August 2014,"Oh wow, another space movie...",Medical engineer Ryan Stone works feverishly to repair her shuttle hundreds of miles from the Earth s atmosphere after a catastrophic collision with orbiting debris damages her likelihood of reentry and survival in Gravity Watching this movie you want to use terms like cool and awesome because technically speaking this movie is magnificent and awe inspiring to watch The purely generated images of the vast abyss of space a cusp of Earth s surface and a gleaming sun astronomically farther away in the background is spectacularly beautiful and I didn t see this in IMAX With limited knowledge of space and aeronautics this is about as real as I can imagine though I know experts disagree I m looking at you Neil deGrasse Tyson Beyond the aesthetically pleasing set design I find little else in this picture remarkable While beautiful its artistry in scenery makes the film detached and voyeuristic Gravity starts almost immediately with the collision and has very minimal character development initially These factors led me to be unable to suspend disbelief and truly immerse myself in the story nor become invested in the main character s survival Further the plot is tired and worn out Several movies of a similar plot precede Gravity which is basically a disaster survival story in space most notably 2001 A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13 among others I can t help but imagine the executives at Warner Bros and how this film came to be We need a hit film a huge money maker but something new fresh CGI its all about that CGI that s what sells movies we ve just got to take it to the next level Yeah but we ve done just about everything on earth That s the problem On Earth space Brilliant and we will make it in Imax get even more money for the tickets Yeah but we have to get actors that get a huge draw in the box office Who is hot right now Robert Downey Jr Angelina Jolie Nah Jolie says she has something scheduled already Downey probably won t want to do it he s too improvisational won t be his style We could get Clooney Everybody loves George But what about the girl Who won best actress last year Jennifer Lawrence Too young Meryl Streep Too old Natalie Portman Not likable enough How bout Sandra Bullock Sandy will probably do it But who is going to take the risk of making this movie It could tank Well he will have to be a relative unknown but made a hit before international so hungry to break into mainstream Hollywood Alfonso Cuar n I think he wanted to be an astronaut when he grew up Isn t he shopping a script set in space And the rest is history In all seriousness the movie never connected with me while visually brilliant it is lacking in all other regards If you are into special effects and the sheer technical breadth of the undertaking of that crew whom I commend then I suggest this movie Check out more movie and culture reviews at our website,3

19 December 2018,Supremely Boring.,Gravity was poorly cast with neither of the two leads performing any other function other than headlining the picture I did not care for either character and the lack of message or story reduces the film to a long sequence of stunts,4
24 June 2019,my notes,Cool scenes and some intense parts but pretty boring overall and don t like survival stories 1 viewing,4
27 November 2013,"Yeah, I don't think I want to be an astronaut anytime soon...",So Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as a scientist sent to fix some satellite in space George Clooney is also there too but the movie centres on Bullock after A while something bad happens and a load of debris hits their ship Now to start off this film had loads of hype before I went to see it people said it was amazing reviewers gave it 10 out of 10 and so I was very excited to see it And when I did see it I can see that the visuals definitely was the source of their enjoyment The whole look of this film is just amazing the long camera pans the intense shots the claustrophobic angles are all brilliant especially in 3D yes I saw Gravity in 3D and it is one of the best 3D films I ve ever seen I imagine it is quite enjoyable in 2D but this was just heightened the experience when that debris was flying towards the screen my eyes sure flinched a lot I thing to some people it may make them feel sick because it is very realistic anytime I now think of people in space this is what I think it would be like just the views and things are amazing The music also goes well with it I love the score to this especially those parts where it goes incredibly loud and then just cuts and its silence like the silence of space The story line itself although good felt a bit repetitive about half way through the scenarios the main character gets in are so similar every time that it verges on unrealistic in that way I think it was hyped just that bit too much but apart from that its an interesting experience to watch and I d see it again,8
28 October 2013,I would rate this movie below 1 if I could.,You cannot make a good movie by having someone float around in space for an hour and a half The movie is unbelievably corny The girl that convinced me to go and see this movie with her started looking up flights on her phone after about half an hour proclaiming that it was boring to which I gladly agreed This movie is terrible I m not sure how to make this review into the minimum 10 lines because let s face it the movie doesn t contain 10 lines worth of content but I feel like people need to see a review from someone that doesn t just do as they re told and follow what the critics say This movie is terrible I will lose faith in humanity if it wins any awards,1
20 October 2019,"IN SPACE, NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU SNORE.",Nominated for everything under the sun because it has two big Hollyood players Otherwise implausible in too many ways insulting to even a child an way overlooked AVOID And get back to Star Trek Classic,1
20 November 2013,One of the best films of the year....,Me and 3D have never really got along There isn t a lot of love there When choosing between watching a film in 2D and 3D I ve always chosen the former and always will do But sometimes films come along that force you to choose 3D Avatar for one I fell asleep halfway through Life Of Pi pretty but needless In short I ve never been blown away by it IMAX is the future in my opinion but bloody expensive 3D it s a fad that will go away just give it a few years But I implore you Go and watch Gravity And make sure you watch it in glorious 3D Gravity for those that don t know is the new film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron Truth be told I wasn t too aware of the name but he has made some fantastic films in the past Y Tu Mama Tambien Children Of Men Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban to name a few All of his best films have the same thing in common visually they re a treat to watch One of the most powerful moments of Children Of Men for example is when blood splatters across the screen and just stays there on the lens With this new film though Cuaron takes that talent to a whole new level The film is unlike any other I have ever seen Visually and viscerally from the very first scene it s a stunning watch Very many excellent films have been made in the past about space but Gravity is the first time that a movie actually takes advantage of the sheer distance and nothingness that space provides It s full of beautiful long shots moving over the Earth the stars the space stations and debris around the place and the people themselves It s jawdropping but as beautiful as it is it s amazing just how terrifying it also becomes As Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock hurtles helplessly through space spinning uncontrollably and screaming for help I was frightened That fright was heightened by the use of 3D this wasn t just objects needlessly flying off the screen at me the 3D tricks were in context and meant something Thankfully what Cuaron manages to do very well is supplement the visuals with a very solid and emotional story Bullock s character has gotten literally lost in space and is desperate to get home But this is not just your usual sci fi adventure flick this is an emotional tale about hope faith and beyond all the idea of letting go Whether it s letting go of a traumatic experience or simply letting go of a wire it s a theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually sets us up for the exciting final third At the heart of it is Sandra Bullock herself as Ryan Stone the veteran actress provides yet another excellent performance You quickly forget that it s Bullock so immersed she becomes in the role Once again the 3D plays a big part here as she floats through space we become her eyes therefore creating a bigger bond between actor and audience But while one actor enhances the film the other one did a helluva job trying to bring it down That s right George Clooney Now I love Clooney I think he s a wonderful actor and you can t help loving that Hollywood charm Gravity however was not the vehicle for this charm I found the character irritating and completely out of place I understood the need for the role of Matt Kowalski but perhaps with a different personality The one dimensional supporting character was made even more irritable because of the unintelligent script A lot of the dialogue here was hokey and full of clich which was a little bit annoying It wouldn t have been so annoying had the other facets of the film not been so brilliant They were though and I wish the script had been too However overall Gravity is still a fantastic film Clooney s performance really isn t that important in the grand scheme of things and you re not going to watch this film for the great script You should be watching Gravity for its ground breaking use of special effects it s changing of the way science fiction and 3D will be viewed in the future and it s engaging story and strong central performance Gravity is one of the best films of the year and one of the best sci fi movies in the last five years Watch it In 3D,9
3 October 2013,Beautifully done!,Going in I had some serious doubts about this movie It looked beautiful but every time the trailer would play in theaters the audience would break into laughter by the end of it It looked silly Sandra Bullock back flipping into the eternal emptiness of space Is this a comedy For some reason the trailers never really connected with me I found it hard to take seriously And then I saw it Forget those trailers This will connect From the start the movie sucks you in You really get a feel for the scope of outer space it s so grand and yet so empty Clooney puts in his usual quality work but it s Bullock who really stretches her acting legs literally and figuratively and shines The story flows well and the tense moments will have you shaking your leg in anticipation that forever backflip lands a much heavier blow when you see the entire scene executed There will be parts where you ll ask Are you serious What else could happen and director Alfonso Cuaron DON T GIVE A DAMN about what you thought couldn t happen because it s GONNA HAPPEN especially if it s the worst possible thing that could happen Yet it never really gets to the point where it s so unbelievable that you re knocked out of the movie There s a fine line being walked and Cuaron nails it Although very mild spoiler that Bullock is an unborn child shot I get the symbolism but come on lol Needless to say this movie is GORGEOUS 3D is a MUST And 3D really compliments the multiple Bullock underwear shots I know I know I m so classy Gravity scores a 4 25 out of 5 on the BDBOS See it in 3D and expect some nominations to roll Sandra Bullock s way after this one Hey guys thanks for reading through my review hope it helps you make a good movie decision I want to help you make more good movie decisions without taking up too much of your time Here s one choice you should make bring your jacket You know how cool it gets in that theater and yet you always wind up wishing you brought it then you just take my jacket AND SPILL SODA ALL OVER IT AND NOW IT S RUINED FOREVER Take the damn jacket Want more advice Like my facebook page Imagine quick and informative movie reviews right on your feed usually posted on or before opening weekend Now imagine a tall slightly tanned strong handsome man giving you said reviews ok tone that down a bit I m not that handsome But still I m hear to help and hopefully have you crack a smile So stop by and say wussup facebook com TheBDBOS thanks again,9
13 October 2013,Fantastic - Only Comparable to Apollo-13,The best science fiction ever made in last decade a masterpiece in fact it can only be compared to another ground breaking movie and my all time favorite Apollo 13 Friends please don t judge it by downloading in your computers you will get nothing out of it it is a 3D marvel Sundra Bullock was never considered to be in the league of highly extraordinary Hollywood actresses but here she has given performance of a lifetime kudos You will feel the horror the fear the loneliness the desperation even more than the astronaut thanks to the director I am a great sci fi fan and love aliens and monsters P but this movie is a great example that you don t need ugly aliens or horrific martians to make an impact all you need is to create the right atmosphere George Cloonie also has made a great impression though his on screen presence was much less than that of Sandra s The 3D visions of beautiful earth from space was just mesmerizing so was the debris of the satellite coming towards you Coming to the story a Russian satellite which was destroyed intentionally started a chain reaction and turned the mission to a struggle for existence But unlike Apollo 13 you don t have Ed Harris to save you out from Houston you are all alone and nobody can hear your scream Though it s a adventure sci fi genre few of the conversations were really touching specially when Sandra got hold of a Chinese wavelength where a father was singing to an infant which did not help her anyway for survival but reminds her of her dead daughter It shows so beautifully that whichever language we speak our emotions are all the same we are only human 5 5 from me an excellent cinema experience MUST WATCH,10
8 October 2013,Gravity Overview,Gravity is a movie that takes on a whole new perspective of astronauts The movie takes you on a journey with a space crew and their final space walk to set up a telescope on a space station While you are watching the movies you can really feel the zero gravity and will even find yourself breathing at the same rate that the crew does The environment of space is portrayed beautifully In the beginning the movie stresses that life in space is impossible This makes it very clear that literally nothing is in space No sound no air and nothing to slow you down if you are caught drifting Overall this is a very well written and made movie There isn t much to say about Gravity without spoiling it because the movie will keep you guessing from start to finish The main focus of this movie is persistence Gravity makes it clear that without persistence you are doomed to live without any happiness and then life becomes pointless Without the amazing character development set up in the first scene we would be forced to watch a long and drawn out movie Luckily that is not the case If it wasn t for Clooney s and Bullock s performance we would have drifted through space with blank characters With the interesting stories that the characters tell each other while in the void of space we are entertained all the way through the movie With the acceptation of a couple of minor plot holes and a few scenes that were a minute to long Gravity is a must see Check out more of our reviews at www brickmoviereviews wordpress com,9

7 June 2015,Boring,I don t know how this movie won any kind of award I watched it with a friend of mine and his two kids It was barely watchable for the adults and the kids found it totally boring It s basically a movie that has Sandra Bullock talking to no one for half the movie The other half she is talking to George Clooney I m a Sci Fy person and found this movie very very slow She uses up all her oxygen and has only 5 left but keeps hyperventilating Somehow the air never runs out She has to read the manual on how to operate the various equipment and somehow gets it all right Even on the Chinese space station she somehow manages to push all the right buttons to get the escape pod to deploy I am so glad I paid less than 10 at Wal mart for this movie,1
5 October 2013,Plain and simple JUNK..,I should have followed my instincts and avoided this movie once i rejected it after the trailer However after a score of more than 8 i decided to give it a try since i like Sci Fi Adventure a lot But i was so much disappointed not only the story has NOTHING to offer but the acting lays so FLAT So many plot holes if u think there was ever a plot in the first place so many clich s over the top effort to show that this movie is extraordinary all this just makes it fall right into the dumpster As pointed by other reviews maybe the visuals are good but frankly I prefer to see a National Geographic documentary than this trash No way even if someone shows you this movie for Free DO NOT GO So disappointed with everything in this movie,1
17 May 2014,Ground breaking cinematography but ...,This film reminded me of when I went to see Jurassic Park for the first time and was overwhelmed by the fact that you couldn t distinguish between the dinosaurs and the real actors In this it was impossible to think of any of the actors as anything but floating weightless It truly is an epic achievement The effects are notable and the acting such as it is within a space suit is fine but even such good performances can t overcome the main flaw in the film the storyline is weak beyond belief After 30 minutes almost everything was guessable and any sense of suspense disappeared It was interesting to notice how the restlessness in the cinema grew as the film went on People simply weren t gripped by what could have been a scenario with exciting possibilities In years to come when such effects are old hat I fear or maybe hope this film will be forgotten,5
8 October 2013,Gravity was quite a treat of a movie about surviving in space when things go wrong,Just watched this movie in 3 D with my movie theatre working friend We both enjoyed it though my friend thought it was weird Yes it s about two people in space who get into snafus while there but the images are beautiful the acting by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are good Alfonso Cuaron s direction is aces and the story is suspenseful enough Ms Bullock is especially compelling enough for the time on screen when she s by herself not knowing if anyone can hear her when she s on headphones Her character s monologue never gets boring as she s always addressing what she s going through and how she s coping with what she s dealing with at the moment And seeing this in 3 D was quite a treat that s for sure So on that note Gravity comes highly recommended,9

9 December 2014,Spectacular celestial existentialism !!!!,I have always been a fan of Alfonso Cuar n Whenever he directs a film you can rest assured that the movie will not be superficial and will have deeper undertones Gravity on the surface is a survival film about two astronauts Bullock and Clooney hopelessly stranded in the emptiness of space and their unrelenting attempts at an improbable survival But it is thematically much deeper Some people have criticised the film in the context of making errors related to the science of space missions and physics But I will argue that this is actually not a film about space The film is about letting go of the past no matter how tough it is to do that and getting reborn and starting your new life in a fresh manner Some have said that the dialogues in the film are cheesy and a forced attempt to make the viewer have empathy for the characters But for me after considering the themes the film is dealing with it seems those dialogue exchanges were essential and very relevant The visuals in Gravity are groundbreaking The cgi work in the film is probably the best I have ever seen in any film Cuar n successfully makes the viewer experience the horror of the situation that the characters find themselves in The camera effortlessly at times seems to glide inside Sandra Bullock s helmet and we are shown what everything looks like from her perspective The explosions in space are violent and scary but also inaudible Along with the larger than life grand visuals we also get some calm serene and surreal imagery which are thematically brilliant There is a lot of visual symbolism throughout the movie Sandra Bullock is fantastic This must have been a very challenging role and she knocks it out of the park Clooney isn t given much to do but his charm oozes in every scene he is a part of and his role is very important thematically Cuar n has made a film that is not only visually marvellous but also thought provoking After Y Tu Mam Tambi n and Children of Men Gravity cements his position in my mind as one of the very best directors working today On the surface Gravity is an unforgettable visual spectacle and a thriller in space But underneath its surface it is a meditation on existentialism dealing with the challenge of overcoming a traumatic past and having the courage to start a new life,10
6 November 2021,Stunning !!,Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and directed Alfonso Cuaron isn t your run of the mill sci fi thriller It s a sparse elegant film that speaks to the mysteries of human emotion and of course space Indeed a stunning bit of moviemaking with depth and insight that make it an intense viewing experience My only regret is that I didn t watch on a cinema screen or indeed iMax which is heightened by the 3D experience It s mature themes death and grief and scenes of gripping peril make it best for teens and adults Gravity has much more to it than the great visuals and direction The music is an incredible fit it s haunting sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful A good deal of the story is gripping with intimacy tension and great emotional impact I used to have an aversion to ANYTHING Sandra Bullock made This however is her coming of age as a dramatic performer In Gravity she gives one of her finest performances and presents this movie a certain grace while George Clooney has an equanimity that fits his role perfectly I believe Bullock carries this movie and that s no mean feat with George Clooney co starring I honestly regret my Sandra Bullock stance and waiting this long to watch it,9

30 November 2020,Disappointing,I have tried twice to watch this film I left a couple of years in between thinking maybe it was me but I gave up after about half an hour The visuals are fantastic but the storyline so slow Not for me I m afraid,4
12 October 2013,"Fabulous Visuals, Substandard Plot",Gravity is a film with fabulous visuals strung together over an appallingly substandard plot of clich s and director indulgent moments Yet again Hollywood has wasted millions on great CGI without bothering with decent writing Part of Gravity s 100 million budget was surely spent on paying marketers to front load sites like IMDb with 10 star reviews It s a trick that works But if you want to know what moviegoers really think of a film wait until it s been out a couple of weeks THEN check the user reviews you ll get a more accurate picture of how good or bad the film is I give Gravity a 6 Sandra Bullock seems like a great person the kind of cool smart chick you d like to hang out with whose pleasing combination of poise and humility makes her fun to watch in feel good movies like Miss Congeniality Unfortunately Sandra Bullock is not a great actor In Gravity she plays protagonist Ryan Stone the focal point of the movie practically the only character Given Gravity s extremely weak story the film REALLY needed an amazing actress to play the part of Ryan Stone A stronger actor like Charlize Theron or Jessica Chastain might have been able to bring much more to this role to help fill out the weak plot with a nuanced and powerful performance But even a great actress couldn t turn Gravity into a movie that was more than just great CGI,6

9 January 2014,"I probably will never watch this again, not because it is bad, it is too good.",This film can easily be said as one of the best this year You see movies like Avatar with stunning visuals you see movies like Inception with intriguing plots And there s Gravity a movie truly live up to the title of Art The settings are a few actors you could count with one hand three outfits for the lead all together and not even any weather change to complement the mood To make a movie with only these how good would the actors the settings must be to make a good movie movie is about director and actor expressing their feelings and you relate it to your own it always sounded clich until i watched this movie The reason i will never watch it again is because i felt every single feelings Ryan Sandra did in the movie The shock the fear the despair the hopelessness the courage the craziness and at last the happiness That was what happened in the movie I think i developed spacephobia just from this movie Never noticed Sandra as an actress but in this movie to move on Earth like she s moving in space was stunning I suggest people to watch behind the scene on youtube spoiler at end of the video to see how Sandra had to act to create the effect,10

12 July 2014,Because the de rigueur position of IMDb reviewers is to hate Gravity...,I m going to swim against the tide Not only do I find the film an incredible technical achievement but the symbolism and allegory built into what is essentially a simple story about survival is so intense I ve watched the film unapologetically five times and I doubt I m finished For those watching just for the surface story you ll be disappointed in the lack of scary aliens and other adrenaline fixes And you ll probably nitpick every minor technical goof That s your prerogative But if you want to feel like you re experiencing a film that is not just about space but about life at it s most primal watching Gravity will be as profound for you as it has been for me,10
12 January 2014,Amazing effects but no Story,There were some amazing special effects lots of excitement and tension in the film Gravity However it lacked enough back story about the characters involved so that we could care about worry about and hope for them If we had known more about who these people were not just a few paragraphs about them I would have been much more excited about their reaching earth safely I m sure it would have been possible to balance the excitement along with the sense of why I am worried about them caring about them and what it will mean if they don t make it safely to earth And who will miss them should they not survive Besides the viewer who in their lives would be distraught about their loss if gravity won I love special effects but I love the drama in the characters lives as much Since they just gave gravity a Golden Glob award I find myself disappointed that a film with such a weak story has won I wanted to like this film more and granted there were a lot of exciting scenes but it just wasn t enough story about the humans involved Like the title Gravity was the only star Too bad It could have been so much involving I went home feeling an odd loss due to not caring much about those who were prey to gravity,5
6 December 2013,Best movie of 2013 : Only watch in 3D,Yes definitely its the best movie of 2013 Best thing about this movie is that it well defined use of 3D technology and this technology in its original spirit And also gave shut up call to its critics In my opinion 3D technology is wonderful for visualization but if used properly Plot is very simple and straight forward nothing complex Its a simple survival story Director has done great job Placed each piece at its right place Theme is very well chosen Like space which is lonely place movie also has no crowd at all Movie is well edited Background score was great and well appreciated as well Sandra and George has done great job specially Sandra put life to her character There is no one else to discuss Final words are that if you really want to enjoy this film truly watch it in 3D It will be a life time experience for you Thats my guarantee This movie is very To the point not a single irrelevant frame include so no question of getting bore at any point Full joy ride for 90 odd minutes and explore new dimensions of 3D entertainment,9

18 January 2014,How in the world did this movie get so many nominations?,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,3
13 February 2014,"No Air, No Sound, No Screams",At the start I would like to advise if you have the chance to watch this movie at an IMAX Cinema in 3D then do it DO NOT WATCH IN 2D If you can only watch it at home make sure you have all the lights out There are a few dark scenes that reflect the 3D emptiness of space in extremely This movie is amazing and horrifying at the same time If I would be an astronaut that must be the worst case scenario that can happen when you re in near Earth orbit There are no cars honking and tell you to move because there is no air so there is no sound and ultimately no one can hear you scream Only real Astronauts who have been in space will know what it sounds like So I think the representation of sound in this movie is pretty good as well The camera work is amazing There is a new VR Virtual Reality set out I think it is available for around 500 bucks or so Watching the movie with that set must be awesome I think And there is a little homage to Stanley Kubrick s 2001 Space Odyssey OK that s what I think it is sorry no spoilers All in all I definitely liked it and highly recommend it Now go watch the movie and enjoy The end,
19 October 2013,Excellent movie (Warning!

7 September 2020,"I wish I had words to describe how bad this movie is, but I don't, you have to see it for yourself.",If you ll like this I don t know but if you expect a flick like this to have accurate intelligent science like The Martian I ll tell you it doesn t If you didn t like Interstellar steer clear from this move it s awful Stunning CG though All else sucks especially the soundtrack which causes an excess of tension it tries to create suspense every 5 minutes your brain gets tired of that,1
12 October 2013,Gravity Sucks!,Life in space is impossible Acclaimed Director Alfonso Cuaron s much appreciated and raved about Gravity opens with these 5 words Ironically Cuaron goes on to prove that even with a master like him at the helm it is possible to make a substandard film It is shocking that Cuaron who is usually known for his memorable characters and gritty portrayal of human relationships has come up with such a marginal script co scripted with son Jonas and absolutely no gripping characters Sample this Sandra Bullock s Dr Ryan Stone is the last person who deserves to be on any mission forget a critical space mission Given that she is prone to panic attacks and her first reaction to any situation is negative chaotic and that of hopelessness At worst Dr Stone is a nervous wreck and at best she is following orders without questioning Old Jungle saying if you can t take the heat get out of the kitchen What in the name of Prometheus is Dr Stone doing in space Watching Dr Ryan Stone fumble her way through space made me instantly crave for Ripley Sigourney Weaver from Alien George Clooney s mission commander Matt Kowalsky is well George Clooney throwing his one liners with panache and being the gorgeous sexy funny counterfoil to dim witted slow and helpless Sandra Bullock Background score from Steven Price makes sure that we all know in advance when a perilous event is just waiting to happen Price overwhelms us with the music instead of intelligently using the loneliness the vacuum and the deafening silence of space at crucial moments in the movie With such one dimensional characters and predictable linear storytelling Director Alfonso Cuaron s salvation comes from fellow Mexican old partner and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Morgenstern The Tree of Life Children of Men Sleepy Hollow who shows us in all its glory and fright what it must be to float in space This is as real as any of us ordinary mortals can come to experiencing space first hand Lubezki is the shining star of this space misadventure And it is for his contribution mostly that I award Gravity 7 out of 10 Otherwise Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity mostly just sucks My top 3 space movies continue to be 2001 A Space Odyssey Contact and Apollo 13,7
24 January 2022,A great survival movie,I unapologetically love this movie The visuals are gorgeous and lend themselves well to Cuaron s penchant for long continuous shots that immerse you in the action The story is beautifully simple a survival story with just the right dose of symbolism and ambiguity to get the viewer talking Aside from a few moments that are extremely unrealistic the movie feels like a brisk 90 minutes that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time,8
2 October 2016,Time to fully review my favourite film of all time.,Space the endless emptiness that holds many wonders and anomalies It s been the setting for hundreds of movies through the years In fact many masterpieces have been set in space Stanley Kubrick s ground breaking 2001 A Space Odyssey Ridley Scott s terrifying Alien and Pixar s animated feature Wall E Then came 2013 a year that seemed to be full of standard summer blockbusters and a few indie films just like any other year But in the fall critics went crazy Nothing could ever beat Avatar visually they all said including myself but i was wrong The behemoth that took the cinema by storm came out Gravity I remember being so excited going to the cinema to watch this I went on release day with my family After the film finished I was on the edge of my seat sweating with my eyes widened at what I just saw From that moment I knew this was the greatest thing I ever watched For a film that consists of essentially 4 actors 3 of them on screen and 1 voice actor I was completely engaged and convinced that I was with those characters Sandra Bullock was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for her role but it was tough year and unfortunately did not win but the nomination alone just shows how incredible she was George Clooney was witty comedic and re assuring as the most experienced astronaut in the group The chemistry between Bullock and Clooney was brilliant given the circumstance of what happens during the film This overall however is Bullock s film she has the most screen time and has to convey the emotions of what she is going through by herself and also inform the viewers what is happening etc Alfonso Cuar n who also directed the underrated Children of Men takes directing duties for Gravity and is absolutely outstanding I mean the first shot of the film is all one take and goes on for 10 minutes The man is a genius when it comes to controlling the camera so many great one take shots which just shows the confidence he has in order to pull them off He balances the dialogue with the thrills perfectly so that it never becomes boring The fact he won the Oscar for best director just proves all of this Emmanuel Lubezki is the cinematographer and also won the Oscar for best cinematography for this movie deservedly so There is also one scene where the camera moves slowly towards bullock s character and then still in the same shot goes through her helmet to see her point of view it s just genius Cuar n also wrote the script with his brother and managed to bring in emotion courage and humour within the 91 minute runtime In space you cannot hear anything Gravity does something very clever in which we hear the sounds of space through the space suits so if a character touches something that is shaking we as the viewers hear the reverb through the suit It s this kind of sound editing that makes this an enthralling experience especially when viewing with surround sound Steven Price is the composer and also won the Oscar for original score The soundtrack to this film is masterful in fact one scene towards the end is so epic because of the composition behind it really gets your heart racing The star of the film however are the visual effects never has space looked so good The detail of Earth in the background and the sun shining in the distance is breathtaking Even during scenes of intense explosions with pieces of metal flying around it s just sublime to look at The way they filmed this was to have Bullock and Clooney in an LED light box and then add the visual effects in after all done by a British team of visual effect experts This is one of the few films designed for 3D viewing and I can honestly say it is on par with Avatar for best 3D effects The ultimate way to view this film is in 3D so if you get the chance don t blink twice just watch it What else is there to say Gravity is my favourite film of all time everyone who knows me knows that I adore this film I physically cannot find a flaw It s a masterpiece Unfortunately it s a film that a lot of people like to hate and sure everyone has their opinions but hating a film just because it s highly rated is not an excuse So if you haven t seen Gravity go out to the shop but the 3D Blu ray but a massive TV with surround sound and enjoy it No thanks necessary you are all very welcome,10
4 March 2014,Technical Dazzle Matched by Real Film-making,Gravity is the most technically astounding and visually stimulating film I have ever seen The immersive cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki lays the building blocks for fantastic visual achievement It is built upon by amazing editing that makes the film seem seamless with multiple minute shots quite common The awe inspiring visual effects are laid on top creating an incredibly accurate picture of space The sound editing also accounts for the fact that no sound can be heard in space as we only hear what the astronauts themselves can hear This allows the film s score to take center stage and it does just that The score creates another immersive facet of this film due to its eerie tone and sudden stops The production design is also top notch accurately portraying all of the spacecraft the astronauts utilize Now all of this would be for naught if the story and acting were lackluster in any way Thankfully they both excel The story has a very deliberate pace that excels at balancing character development and suspenseful action sequences Because the movie is short it never truly drops its pace allowing it to pack quite a punch The acting is truly impeccable Sandra Bullock gives arguably the best performance of her career while Clooney supports her nicely as Bullock s foil Clooney playing the more experienced astronaut remains calm during the crises on screen Bullock panics quite often and is always tense being the rookie Subtleties like these manifest themselves quite well on screen and fill in several unspoken pieces of character background In conclusion Gravity s technical dazzle is completely matched by its highly competent story and acting creating a groundbreaking masterpiece,8
16 October 2013,An outstanding film made by a brilliant mind - Alfonso Cuaron!!,What links many of the greatest films ever made is their ability to transport the viewer to a different time and place and in the case of some films to an entirely new universe Not since James Cameron s Avatar in 2009 have I enjoyed an experience as immersive as Gravity Achieved by seamlessly merging live action with the most advanced visual effects technology especially developed for this film Gravity takes us to outer space in a way that no movie has before For all its slick technical wizardry Gravity is about hope and courage and the will to come out alive To best enjoy it go in with patience and an open mind I m going with four and a half out of five Deserving entry in Oscars and other Global Film Awards yet to come,10

11 October 2013,"Best visual, 3D movie till today with a superb acting Bullock",I rated a 10 exceptional and that it is I have rated 3 movies with a 10 so it is not my custom way of doing Certainly better films will come but today it is one of the best I ever seen The subject is unique and it is a very hard one not to make a boring movie It is NOT you are nailed on your seat Only 2 actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock no site stories no chases just Sandra and George and their story to survive in outer space and to try to save themselves Such a clean movie and such a thriller Lets make it clear directly This is a Sandra Bullock movie and she does a superb job This time George Clooney is just George and providing the movie of some relaxing moments Sandra Bullock is a good actress and in this movie she proves it In fact she already did so in Crash but this one is to confirm it She has to survive but she will also overcome her personal problems Just good acting Why she bothers to evolve herself with some crap movies You have to see it in 3D it is a must The movie will loose a lot when seen in 2D Their are some fantastic visual shots of earth of the debris passing by the ISS of the water floating in space better said in the theater The camera work is done in an almost excellent way For example when the camera moves in the helmet of Dr Stone in 3D it is like you are in her place The visuals on earth and space is an eye festivity The story is well done not complicated just find the way back you could say and 1 30 hrs is just the time to do so not boring at all May be you want to search for some mistakes in the movie Well there are obvious But which movie doesn t have Example On a certain moment it seems there is gravity in space when holding some objects OK that is it Just go to see it in 3D It is a masterpiece of today s possibilities in movie making,8
10 March 2014,Surviving in space ain't easy,With the only introduction of some uncomforting music the viewer get s thrown into space and the theme for the rest of the movie is set immediately 2 people are doing maintenance on a shuttle Ryan Sandra Bullock and Matt George Clooney and you know they are not going to have an easy time in space Ryan is a conflicted woman and it looks like she is literally trying to escape her problems by being in space Only to find way more trouble up there forcing her to face herself It s amazing to see planet earth from a distance in the background during almost the entire time and it s an remarkable achievement how they manage to recreate space The fact that almost everything take s place in there make s this film even more fascinating Of course the idea of astronauts in space getting in trouble definitely isn t a new thing for horror science fiction movies but the way Alfonso director handles this subject is really refreshing This is because although this film is labeled as Science fiction there isn t really something futuristic in it and Alfonso tried to keep it real and personal in terms of the story and thank god there aren t aliens showing up all of a sudden Let s be honest the idea of being stuck in space is already horrifying enough on itself Especially because it s so dangerous and yet we still know so little about it The film really plays out like a kind of horror movie because in the end it s all about escaping death and trying to survive It sucks you in from the start and doesn t let you go until the titles roll 80 minutes later This is also mainly because of the marvelous presentation This kind of movie magic is really rare to happen I personally think and i haven t seen it for a long time in a big Hollywood production The last time was with Christopher Nolan s Inception It really depends on having an talented director with his own vision and giving him a large amount of money to play with Of course this has been going wrong a lot of times but once in a time you have a director who is able to do something special with it He really creates a fascinating setting and uses the budget to enforce the experience instead of using special effects only for the wow factor This is a thing which is to be seen in a painfully lot of big budget Hollywood movies There s only one small drawback for me in this movie and that are the actors Sandra bullock does a descent job portraying an woman alone in space trying to survive and George Clooney is playing the charming guy as always It s just that for me this movie would be way more believable if I didn t have to look at actors i ve seen an dozen times before but instead just some unfamiliar faces who could be anyone Of course it ain t a big problem because you have to link famous names to an big production This movie really is an new landmark in Hollywood after inception creating something special with large amounts of money instead of making an special effect show reel out of it,9
8 November 2015,"""It's not rocket science"" ... uhmmm, yeah it is, George.",My complaints aren t just about Clooney s fuel usage their inertia when going to the ISS or Bullock s underwear That s the obvious stuff What s less obvious is there is little adherence to orbital mechanics in any of the film You can t just point the re entry vehicle at Earth You d have to fire your rockets to decelerate enough to begin losing altitude and so you re slow enough that the friction as you descend into thicker atmosphere safely continues to decelerate you using the heat shield That is a BIG deal The atmosphere is otherwise lethal to you heat shield or not Sure stuff superficially moves basically o k And is kind of floaty and equal but opposite reactiony but most everything else is wrong It s not just inertia here or a lack of anything pulling Clooney away from the structure there The latter heroic disconnect scene could have been fixed with just rotating the damaged station to give them centrifugal force Gravity is a negligible effect since they re already in orbit i e going real fast laterally and being high enough to be out of the thick atmosphere so they don t burn up Rotation is easy enough to do with CGI elements too and logical since the ISS was just hit by debris Just requires some expensive computer time at the FX house re rendering that scene using the already built 3D models and textures In fact you could leave all the principle scene elements as is and just revolve the Earth around them in the background slowly Bingo stupid physics moment solved That s unforgivable but what s more unforgivable is the just point and fire your rocket view of orbital physics in getting from one place to another that occurs repeatedly Even if miraculously all of those stations and the shuttle were nearby and visible with the naked eye which is completely ludicrous unless they made some point of saying they d all just rendezvoused recently for some long planned joint venture with the Hubble telescope hard even in real life you d still never be able to get there in a strait line Orbital mechanics is all about change in velocity governing altitude and then arc rendezvous paths If you magically had enough fuel and thrust you d have to change your velocity change your orbital path and loop around a few times until you meet up with the other object Otherwise you d end up in front of or behind the object depending on your altitude differential And that s even if you re lucky enough to just so happen to be going in the same direction before you begin the maneuver which is just about never That s actually what s so dangerous and crazy about orbital mechanics even in the unlikely event the ISS or Chinese space station could be seen and you had A LOT of leftover fuel after your stupid Abyss opening scene like joyriding yeehaw you wouldn t be able to reach it That s pretty dramatic in my opinion The lack of air and the possibility of space junk causing you to explode into a mess of sparks aren t really the most interesting part of this orbital stuff in my opinion Everything is moving fast up there otherwise you would fall back to Earth and it takes a lot of energy to change the arrangement let alone do that in a way that matches with the path of anything else let alone actually meet up with it There are people making the argument that you can t have a dramatic and captivating movie where all this is accurately portrayed What about Das Boot Alive Men of Honor K2 Pressure Everest They all tried to be realistic about other dangerous environments that cut you off from civilization and safety I realize The Martian tried this a little but that s more obvious and had its own issues Besides Matt was on another planet What about the bizarreness of being right there visible to someone with a telescope and there s nothing anyone can do to save you That interests me I don t think you have to severely compromise physics to have drama and keep people in the seats rather in the case of an orbital emergency film the physics is where much of the danger comes from,5
11 October 2013,I didn't think it was that good!,GRAVITY Four Stars Out of Five This sci fi man vs nature disaster film has already won over critics and audiences alike in the first week of it s theatrical release and is now considered the frontrunner to win Best Picture at this year s Oscars which would make it the first science fiction film to ever do so It s directed by acclaimed Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron who also helmed such critically loved films as 2006 s CHILDREN OF MEN 2004 s HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and 2001 s Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN He co wrote the film with his son Jonas which is about two astronauts lost in space while struggling to survive the elements and make it home alive The film stars just two actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney along with the voice talents of Ed Harris who has appeared in other classic space films like APOLLO 13 and THE RIGHT STUFF and a few others Bullock does give a very impressive performance and Cuaron s direction is once again topnotch but it s the 3D visuals that really make this film a one of a kind experience Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer on her first mission in space Clooney plays Matt Kowalski the commanding astronaut of the flight on his last space mission before retiring They re on a routine spacewalk attempting a tune up of the Hubble Space Telescope when debris from the destruction of a Russian satellite comes hurdling their way The debris damage their shuttle beyond repair and kills the rest of their crew leaving Stone and Kowalski adrift in space tethered just to each other Communications with Mission Control are completely lost as the two attempt to make their way to the International Space Station near by The film has been praised by my favorite filmmakers James Cameron who received a special thanks credit at the end of the movie along with some of my other favorite directors like David Fincher and Guillermo del Toro and Quentin Tarantino Cameron called it the best space film ever done It s also been praised by real life astronaut legend Buzz Aldrin and almost every film critic It s guaranteed to get multiple Oscar nominations and like I said is now predicted to take home the top prize I didn t think it was that good I enjoyed the movie but didn t find it to be one of the very best of the year Technically it s a flawless masterpiece and the 3D is amazing but it s not as visually striking or nearly as good a film as Cameron s own AVATAR Bullock does give one of the better performances of the year playing a character that s similar to another classic sci fi heroine Ellen Ripley in vulnerability and resilient strength and the man vs nature storyline is always a compelling one but this movie mainly works as a beautiful visual feast and little more Does it deserve to win best picture and all the critical praise it s been getting No but it is definitely still worth seeing for the scenery alone Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at  www youtube com watch v M D0yOH Zx4,8
18 October 2013,"Gravity: Best picture of the year, or a little over-hyped?",Ever since Gravity released in theaters it has been the talk of the movie world Numerous critics and viewers are praising the film on every aspect stating it as the movie of the year Gravity is without a doubt one of the better movies that has released this year but is it as good as everyone is stating As a movie set in space Gravity immediately immerses you with absolutely jaw dropping visuals In 3D or 2D the film s visuals are so stunning that at times I wondered if parts of the film were actually shot in space Movies set in space need to capture the beauty and wonder of space to truly sell where the movie is taking place and to reiterate Gravity does this just as good if not better than any other space film before it If I were to review this film just for its eye popping CG effects it would receive a 10 10 easily The movie is captivating in the visual department and makes you never want to draw your attention elsewhere However there is more to a movie than just the special effects Where the visuals exceed beyond belief the majority of the rest of the movie is good and in certain areas great but overall fall short of accomplishing the same feats that the visual effects do The story is very straight forward and almost really not important to the movie at all Gravity is a movie that shows the beauty and horrors of space and is about two astronauts struggle for survival after their mission goes wrong My point being that while the film is really about the moment and not a huge story a well put together story could have created a more heart felt and dramatic atmosphere and it could ve helped in making each scene even more intense After all Gravity is a movie that attempts to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire 90 minutes so the more reason to care the better In its own right their are several tense moments throughout the film but the lack of a well put together plot overall knocks down the intensity and at some moments leave the movie a bit dull A movie about two astronauts floating in space has potential to be pretty boring when you think about it so solid acting is needed to keep the movie exciting and evoke realism and director Alfonso Cuaron was able to work with a pair of A list talents in Sandra Bullock and George Clooney The main star of the movie is Bullock who plays Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission Bullock does a wonderful job creating a very real reaction to someone in space for the first time when disaster strikes At first we see Stone as a complete train wreck but she quickly evolves into a calm and adaptive character thinking on her toes and using smarts to survive While the performance by Bullock to bring realism to the screen is great again the script hurts the intensity this time in the form of weak character development Once again a movie such as this doesn t need the attention to detail it s all about the moment But again the overall feel of the film is less heart racing when you don t have much to really care about We learn a little bit about Stone in the early goings but nothing significant enough to really make a character that you will want to remember George Clooney s character Matt Kowalsky suffers from the same fate and even more so than Dr Stone but still Clooney adds some occasional humor and is a nice compliment to Bullock In a movie such as this with only two starring roles character development is key and the lack of that again takes away a chunk of that immersive magic Gravity sets out to create So what do we have We have exceptional visuals and some great exciting and intense moments complimented by the aforementioned CG effects and realistic and splendid acting For a movie about survival in space that s all you need to make a Best Picture candidate right Unfortunately wrong There s more to a movie than the previously stated things and in my personal case the script needs to be the strongest part of the movie in terms of story character development the whole 9 yards Alfonso Cuaron as created a wonderful film that aims to immerse you with scene after scene of exhilarating set piece moments but the weak script rob the film of achieving movie gold If you were to watch Gravity just for the beautifully stunning visuals and for each moment of intensity then I can see why it is being considered by many to be the best film of the year But when you break it down piece by piece as a whole the movie doesn t quite meet the hype surrounding it 7 5 10 rounded to 8 on website,8
10 November 2013,I should have passed,This is probably my first review for a film I just had to write this one I was so impressed by the number of good ratings and the great reviews that I simply ignored the bad ones How could a movie with an average rating of 8 5 can be a waste of time Impossible So I went ahead to watch it Let me tell you exactly what actually put me off The movie had no great story Limited dialogs of actors that really didn t have to worry much about acting since they had this astronaut helmet on most of the time There is only one woman and one man that you see in almost the entire movie since there re no people just passing by in space Just a few scenes that had great cinematic effects totaling around 10 15 mins or so probably an exaggeration and that was it So if you re in for just a few repetitive scenes of awesome cinematics and that s it then this is a movie for you otherwise like me you ll end up looking at people around you wondering who among them would give this an 8 5 Hope this helps some,5
9 January 2014,An experience rather than entertainment,Although I ve seen a lot of 3D movies few of them really used this technology to the fullest A convincing movie doesn t need to be realistic as we all know be it animated black white or quixotic This movie however uses the big screen 3D and impressive sound effects to the fullest to really take us into space a place where men do not belong As a movie story entertainment and such it is merely good As a cinema experience however it s literally breathtaking It has been a while since I ve seen anything so moving No doubt there wasn t any other movie in 2013 that came close,8
4 October 2013,Not exactly The Right Stuff,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,6
11 October 2016,"Horribly boring, poorly acted, and a simpleton's dialog",What a disaster movie pun intended Like the original Star Trek movie this movie has some interesting special effects and familiar faces which at first glance makes you think its something remarkable Instead the story line is absolutely dumb boring unbelievable and pointless There really is NO story here but rather a contrived and narrowly scoped situation that supports the producers desire to use high end technologies to make pretty pictures Bullock and Clooney delivery horribly silly performances unbelievable preposterous and dorky The only positive notes I can add as stated above is the visual presentation is very good Visit the NASA web site and you will find same similar real images minus the formula gimmicks of the movies,3

17 October 2013,A film affected by Kessler Syndrome.,GRAVITY its the most wonderful 3D experience of my life I have seen a number of movies about spaceships alien worlds etc but none of those detailed the picture of space like this one Camera movements light and sound were just fantastic Sandra bullock and George Clooney their expressions were perfect I bet audience have also enjoyed their conversations After watching this movie I have felt how lucky i am to be a part of this wonderful world The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is just hilarious It was so good that even I felt the helplessness of Dr Ryan Stone right from my seat in the cinema hall The scenes of collisions and explosions were equally bizarre because there were no sound and that is normal in the space The visual effects extraordinary 3D effects and the thrill which have been maintained throughout the whole movie will definitely make it one of the finest creations of Hollywood,10
8 December 2013,After seeing it u will wonder if u r on earth or in space !,GRAVITY A technological marvel An unnerving unforgettable and devastatingly overwhelming experience A cinema lover s delight A hell of a movie a hell of a story those who ve seen the movie will comprehend that makes u go WOW Alfonso Couron s brainchild is a masterpiece directed with such technical wizardry n finesse that it is worthy of an Oscar nomination The moment the film was over and the lights came back on I was all overwhelmed reverberating n heavy headed It took me a while to realize that I m on ground n not in space Tis that good The movie touches the very core of your soul It tugs at your heartstrings makes u teary eyed makes u quiver with fear n fills your heart n body with unimaginable and intangible depths of an emotion called HOPE which is the central theme of the film the struggle to survive n emerge triumphant despite all odds I m running out of words In fact words can t do justice to such a film Tis an experience of a lifetime that not needs but deserves to be seen to be cherished n treasured Hats off Alfonso Cuaron sir n expecting many more of such mind bending stuff from u As for the lead actors George Clooney n Sandra Bullock are as usual exemplary George Clooney gets the timing of his deadpan humor right and Sandra Bullock hits off all the right emotional notes This movie is not recommended tis a must watch Period,10
20 November 2013,Two astronauts are stranded in space after the shuttle is hit by debris,While veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney and medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock are on a routine space walk their shuttle is destroyed leaving them alone to survive the emptiness of space The comparisons will be made and rightly so to Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey due to the meticulous attempts of realism within the absoluteness of space In Gravity there is a film so technically brilliant that Kubrick could only begin to comprehend the leaps that Alfonso Cuar n has taken since 1968 Cuar n has developed from what Kubrick began showing space in its realism not only in its vastness but its emptiness and its ferocity The film opens with a spectacular shot highlighting the nothingness of space and the insignificance we hold within it as the blackness envelopes our earth The chaos of space is also to be marvelled at early in the film as the camera movement sends us on an unreadable journey as the space shuttle collapses and our characters are flung tumbling out of control into the blackness There is nothing for us to hold onto and the disorientation of space only grows throughout the film The commitment of Cuar n and his team in depicting space is shown in the exquisite sequences whether at a merciless speed or a near stand still It is a technical masterpiece that immerses you within its world often filming from a first person point of view to show the perplexity of outer space It is a testament to modern technology that such an experience can be created and the way that it is harnessed is sure to be inspirational to future filmmakers Alfonso Cuar n s use of 3D shows how exceptional the technology can be when employed in the right circumstances It is the depth of the picture that really contributes to the understanding of the limitlessness of space in what is a visually mesmerising work The 3D of Gravity is essential to the film as you need to be engulfed by the surroundings the flat screen is not enough to create the illusion of never ending space There is also no obstruction of the 3D to the cinematography of the film with the tantalising beauty of Earth constantly radiating in the background as a constant reminder of home This is not a film to be experienced anywhere other than at the cinema as the beauty and magnitude can only be transcribed across the big screen The narrative is linear without the need to go off course as there is enough within the immediate fear of the impossibility of surviving in space to create continuous tension The need within Hollywood to create action and overly complicated plots is often detrimental to any character development ending in largely soulless films By stripping the plot down to its believable minimum in this way Cuar n creates a much more intimate character led sci fi There is cohesion between the technical brilliance ever present in a sci fi film alongside the basics of character understanding in a drama that has become all but extinct in recent years George Clooney practically plays himself in this film as the charming veteran whose smooth and calming voice is there to bring Sandra Bullock s up tight and nervy amateur to her survival senses Sandra Bullock is outstanding throughout the film as Dr Stone and is toned down to the bare bones of the helplessness of this character The tenderness that she plays the role is what makes the performance and constantly pangs at you for her survival especially as her character grows Sandra Bullock manages to embody the isolation and loneliness of space that is pivotal to the way Cuar n wants to display it With a film so heavily based on CGI although you could not tell the physical and emotional performance of both Clooney and Bullock is something to marvel at In Gravity Alfonso Cuar n has shown true genius unfolding a film that spectacularly breaks technical boundaries as well as holding together the purity of its ideals,9

14 October 2013,¡gracias...Mr Cuaron,Gravity is the best film I have seen in my life Right from the opening act where Clooney s space walking Kowalsky Bullock s Stone admire the beauty of the Earth from the silence of the space till the final act I don t want to give it out this film is an achievement of the highest order In fact Gravity is one of those rarest of rare cases where Cinema takes the form of Art Not since Avatar or more recently Ang Lee in his Life of Pi has anyone used 3D so brilliantly that it actually transcends the dimensions of make believe The music score by Steven Price are to give you goosebumps Emmanuel Lubezki s cinematography seamlessly captures the effects the emotions on the faces of the actors the results are the best seen in a long long time Clooney as usual is at his cool avatar but its Bullock who is the star of Gravity As the lonely mother who has lost her child untimely a first timer in space another catastrophe is too much for her to handle and Bullock is just brilliant in that This is where the father son Jonas Cuaron what a talented guy screenwriter duo step in The journey from drifting in space with no one to help you out hear you out to back home on earth is so masterfully crafted that yes you start rooting for them But Gravity s ultimate brilliance lies in the fact that while we do root for our space walker worker duo to come back home we also think that such a glorious death might just also be just fine But eventually do they both get back in one piece Gravity talks about survival human willpower hope like no other film since Danny Boyle s criminally under appreciated 127 Hours Neil Armstrong had famously said after landing on the moon one small step for man one giant leap for mankind Such a thing happens here in Gravity also albeit in a metaphorical manner I have rated 10 10 stars for Alfanso Cuaron s Gravity But how do you count the stars in space Mr Cuaron this film of yours is for the history books,10

24 December 2013,Overrated,Giving this movie 8 out of 10 stars is a huge stretch and I suspect that the fact that Clooney and Bullock especially Bullock is in it has a hell of a lot to do with why this film got such high marks The movie is predictable and annoying at times especially with Sandra Bullock and her return to the movie Speed screaming The camera work and scenery were great but the plot was slightly better than OK and the acting was about the same Overall the movie is very watchable but certainly not worth all of the hoopla I think 6 stars out of 10 is fare A lot of money was spent on this film but there was a lot more that should ve been done to make it more believable for 1 and just better all around in my opinion,6

25 December 2013,"Excellent visuals, so-so plot",By the time most of you read this review Gravity will not be in cinemas If you haven t seen it on the big screen then you re missing out on its biggest asset Gravity is a special effects film Watched in 3D and on a large screen it s easy to get so sucked into the environment that you could actually believe it s shot in space Some of this will translate to your home television but I think it ll lose a lot on a smaller screen And that s bad because the plot line underneath isn t up to much Neither Clooney nor Bullock put in a bad performance here but the story is fairly standard Hollywood stuff which doesn t leave you caring what happens or gripped by the action Neither of which are a problem in a cinema where the pretty graphics are a spectacle all by themself At home Not convinced,6
30 November 2013,One of the worst films I have ever had to sit through,Dreadful script no plot one dimensional characters repetitive action repetitive visuals I couldn t care less about what happened to either of the people I estimate it took about one day of George s time and four days for Sandra Bullock to get her hysterics right and her hot pants to fit correctly Then off the the CGI studio and hey you have a movie It might be the worst movie of all time but then that s Hollywood I ve just had a notice that I have to write 10 lines of text For a film this awful that s quite a challenge Still here goes Opening captions There is no oxygen in space beats the Mediterranean Sea caption at the start of the otherwise excellent Bourne series Final shot out of focus with our hot panted Sandra going nowhere Everything in between was just as dreadful Although I laughed out loud every time she pulled out a manual to work out how to fly the space station Reminds me of happy hours wasted trying to fix my old Morris Minor Otherwise I struggled to keep awake but as I couldn t believe the film was so bad I thought I owed it to my grandchildren so I could say Yes I was there and I lived through it just,1
7 May 2019,What a Bore!,What in the heck was the hooplah over this movie One of the most boring stupid movies I have ever seen Like watching the grass grow That would be more exciting,1
9 October 2013,One Helluva Ride Indeed,This film is highly recommended My review Tag lines are a funny thing Created by clever ad men they lure the unexpected masses to their product with a few carefully chosen words that are usually misleading Only on rare occasions are they ever accurate especially in the hyperbole of the science fiction film genre However some slogans do ring true Stanley Kubrick s masterwork 2001 A Space Odyssey used The Ultimate Trip as its come on Ridley Scott s classic sci fi thriller Alien had this tag line In space no one can hear you scream In Alfonso Cuar n s exhilarating new film Gravity the catchphrase is just a three word message Don t Let Go This film doesn t and for 90 gripping and tension filled minutes it takes us on a metaphysical journey in space where no one can hear you except Mission Control in Houston And this ultimate and dangerous trip is all the more frightening because of the dire lifelike isolation of a person set adrift and totally alone Gravity is grounded in realism There are no extraterrestrial creatures or mystical interventions to contend with The simplistic story is essentially a battle of survival concerning the sudden dangers of exploration and its daring space travelers caught in its stratosphere Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a first time traveler and medical engineer and Matt Kowalski George Clooney is a wise cracking veteran astronaut Both are on a mission to repair parts of the satellite While on a spacewalk high speed debris destroys their spacecraft leaving them lost in space This event happens almost immediately once the film begins with an amazing opening tracking sequence of visual mastery that is absolutely breathtaking to behold See it in 3 D IMAX for full effect Alfonso Cuar n has been a strong director in his past efforts Y Tu Mam Tambi n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Children of Men but this film may be his masterpiece His unique vision of outer space is haunting and poignant rivaling Kubrick s earlier film Of course technical advances have improved since the late 60 s Cuar n stresses a sense of dread and foreboding doom throughout the film which weighs heavily on the characters and the movie going audience His highly effective camera work and compositions create powerful imagery that are unlike anything seen before it His point of view and use of perspective sometimes seen from inside the space helmet or in the claustrophobic space chambers ratchets up the suspense Cuar n also co edited and co wrote the film s script with Mark Sanger and his son Jon s Cuar n respectively It s a concise and straightforward tale about tragic miscalculations and man s instinct for survival although there are some plot contrivances at the journey s end The film swings from scenes of infinite beauty using darkness and light and silence and sound which maximizes the tension Images of remarkable grandeur continually fill the screen The use of stylized movement and floating objects create an eerie and poetic impression from sudden tears suspended in mid air to a space traveler afloat striking an embryonic pose Kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki for his stunning camera work and to Steven Price s lively musical score both of which contributed to the film s overall impact While the technical aspects of the film are all top notch the film is essentially a standard and rather conventional two character drama Creating that necessary emotional connection with the audience are Bullock and Clooney who are more than up to the task Bullock projects the inner fear and strength needed for such a physically demanding role Clooney uses his macho bravado and leading man charisma to great effect masking the more sensitive and protective aspects beneath his character s surface Gravity deals directly with the issue of survival of solitary confinement within our vast macro cosmic universe It is an epic film with stunning visual effects masterful direction and superb acting This riveting film is a thoroughly intriguing and memorable movie going experience and one of the best films of the year At one point in the film an astronaut says about this space adventure It s one helluva ride Gravity surely is that and more GRADE A ANY COMMENTS Please contact me at jadepietro rcn com,10
27 October 2013,"Gravity was a bit of a downer, (no pun intended)",Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,5
8 March 2022,An enjoyable journey,Gravity is one of the few movies that try to tell a story entirely separated from everyday life and its struggles which it accomplishes without sacrificing emotion The characters are thrown into a troubling scenario doing their best to battle not some ordinary political opponent but the distant to the audience threat of the lack of gravity As the movie progresses the brilliant special effects work truly helps us understand the dangers of floating into the unknown miles off the earth At the same time the subtle long takes sparingly used by the director convey a true sense of loneliness and desolation However there are still a few notable flaws in the movie The motives of the characters are too obvious and mainstream while the dialogues often get repetitive and base Moreover the pacing is a bit slow to emphasize the emptiness of space but in the end it feels like a highly energetic and immersive action script has been badly chopped down to a failed drama Overall Gravity is a visually pleasing experience with a unique tone some may find truly inspiring Were it a bit longer and more complicated it could have been a true cinematic masterpiece,7
6 October 2013,The Definition of Spectacular Filmmaking,What really makes a film great In my mind a film has to have some form of complexity whether it s through its plot story or through its thematic material At first glance Gravity might seem like a simple action movie set in space but once you notice Alfonso Cuaron s name in the credits you suddenly understand that there s definitely more there than meets the eye and that s exactly how it turned out to be To analyze Gravity to the fullest extent would take numerous pages which means my review would eventually outstay its welcome Anyways moving on all you need to know prior to entering the darkened theater is that the film stars two of America s sweethearts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and that it ll take you on an unforgettable and exhilarating ride I don t need to cover the premise in four or five paragraphs like some people frankly it annoys me But I just have to dedicate a fair share of time to address the level of immersion this film provides Again it s one of the most immersive experiences you ll ever encounter as you really feel like you re in outer space and I m not exaggerating I highly recommend all of you to go see it in IMAX 3D immediately before it s too late because that s basically the perfect format for a film of this caliber It was meant to be experienced in IMAX 3D and I can t say that for a lot of films but by god just do it The sound design is unbelievably impressive The filmmakers were somehow able to replicate the right vibrations and volume considering distance and enclosure and once that camera enters the astronaut s suit you undoubtedly and unexpectedly feel the character s pulse and their every movement required to deal with that encumbering outfit And when you hear a thundering boom or the commencement of the film s phenomenal soundtrack you ll probably then realize just how surreal and larger than life of a picture you re truly witnessing The music itself implements so much energy into the feature where at times it absolutely causes goosebumps or sends chills down your spine and given the booming and grand surround sound in the IMAX 3D room you will be left in awe and forced to the edge of your seat Overall it s chilling and terrifying at times and then impactful and resounding elsewhere On another and arguably more important note you have the spectacular cinematography and visuals which honestly serve as the highest draws and strengths of Gravity The amount of work and the power of the technology put into this production is simply astounding and as the audience views this unprecedented exhibition of multiplex filmmaking they can t help but wonder how in the world this unforeseen feat was pulled off How were the filmmakers capable of convincingly casting us into space seemingly accurately capturing its frightening and remote ambiance One might ruin the magic by insultingly responding with a they used a green screen but there s so much more to it than floating in front of a green screen I can only imagine the effort put into the editing process which had to perfectly sync every little detail and sound to the impeccable camera work Let me tell you Alfonso Cuaron wowed the world back in 2006 with the work that was Children of Men in how it completely redefined the idea of lengthy shots Relating back to Gravity the first shot you see of the film its opening in other words lasts for about fifteen to twenty minutes fifteen to twenty minutes For that duration of time the camera keeps on rolling and in doing so it moves from one focused object to another or character while countless events are occurring How many takes did it take oops nothing I can do to finally attain the perfect shot Who knows but it s mind boggling to even think about The actors the props the cinematographer the entire sound department everyone were unquestionably under a lot of pressure while this technologically striking visually beautiful elaborated shot s continued The picture only continued with this style as the rest still mostly consists of lengthy shots Unfortunately even though the critics have loved raving about it on a constant basis over the last week it s not a perfect film I ve read some reviews after my viewing and I ve noticed just how much exaggeration these critics have been incorporating into their opinions Noticeably I can tell why There s been an abundance of hype and praise surrounding this picture and no one wants to be the outlier thus they begin stretching the actual depth and thematic material of the film quite a bit In reality you can do this with almost any film in existence but there comes a point when your reader can easily point out where you specifically start entering the field of bulls Truthfully the film occasionally feels like it s moving at a slow pace For some odd reason most of the critics out there seem to be applauding its lightning pace but that s certainly not the case You could tell there were moments that calmed and slowed down and as much as the film advertises you being on the edge of your seat the entire time that s not how it really plays out And of course the passionate fans will come out and pan someone for possessing attention span issues but you can approach any film s haters with such an excuse attack Let s attack people for having attention span deficits when they complain about the Tree of Life s snail like pace but that s a discussion for another day To read further check out http www movie blogger com movie review

4 October 2013,How long can you hold your breath?,One after another Hollywood churns out films that are either sequels prequels remakes or reboots It seems there is a real problem with writers these days as the ability to make anything original seems to be in very short supply Want to make a summer blockbuster Put a costume on spend some time setting up a story and then spend sixty minutes blowing everything up Superman World War Z Elysium and Iron Man 3 would be some good examples All these films were visually satisfying but for this viewer emotionally empty Which is not to say that I didn t enjoy all of them in some way along with the popcorn and Milk Duds Now we have Gravity and instead of characters who are larger than life we have Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone Maybe that s a key here the lead is a woman and while men are logical women are emotional So it s easier from that standpoint for an audience to build an emotional connection Stone is any of us if we somehow were brilliant enough to make it in to Space yet she still crashed the simulator every time We can relate So why do I think this movie is a 10 It really isn t perfect How much abuse can a person s body take without breaking This like many other films subjects its stars to some serious body blows There are things that are repeated in its zippy 90 minutes Still it had me holding my breath literally more than any film since Hurt Locker Gravity had me feeling that I was there with Ryan Stone as all hell was breaking loose and I believed that it was possible to survive to keep living to tell you a story Open your eyes your ears your heart and live,10
8 December 2020,Could have been worse?,Probably no This is one of the worst space related film I ve ever seen In reality absolutely nothing would happen the way it happened in the film It s so shallow so predictable so obvious and so painfully against the laws of physics that I couldn t believe this actually ended being produced I don t understand why wasting so much money for something like this where all that potential could be used to actually educate people give them something to think about some substance The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is simply because of where the plot takes place I love cosmos even though this one was made on Earth by people who never been out there in space and who didn t bother to consult with some who actually went there,2
16 December 2013,Truly Dreadful.,The most over hyped crap I ve seen in years I am currently half way through this film with no desire to see the rest if I could claw back the last wasted hour of my life I would Sandra Bullock has reached a new low and only confirmed my belief that all her movies are to be avoided Total rubbish Sci fi is a genre open to and full of spurious movies but adding George Clooney and Sandra Bullock is like trying to polish a turd No amount of over acting can save a weak plot like this The way Sandrea Bullock breathes throughout this apology for a movie can only be likened to an asthmatic labrador who has been fed a diet of fat cigars Why do I have to write 10 lines concerning this garbage Over acted Tick Weak Plot tick Sandra Bullock Tick Does this movie have any redeeming factors No well not so far and we re 3 4 the way through Codswallop,1

20 October 2013,Best film of 2013 so far-,Before this film in my opinion the greatest special effects of all time were in Avatar Everything was so realistic you could see sweat on their faces This film not only trumps everything that Avatar has brought us but I really don t see these effects aging for a long long time I could be proved wrong you could see the models in Star Wars the shark looks like a dummy in Jaws but this might be different I am a big fan of Cuar n s style as a director I love the darker tone that he brings to his films his point of view shots in his films are flawless He went all out he pushed the boundaries for not only what he could do but what a director can do Same with the acting Sandra Bullock gives a great performance as Ryan Stone If she was any lesser of an actor than the effect that this film had on us would be lesser Bullock is one of those actors that you root for every time She has that charisma you want her to survive In my opinion the most atmospheric and powerful moments of the film is when she is alone This is a tremendous feat considering she is in front of a green screen 99 of the time George Clooney brings a likability to his role his character was very entertaining and a relief when the film was at its darkest This is the movie event of the year so far no doubt about it If you haven t seen a film that you enjoyed so far this year go see this film if you haven t already,6
4 October 2013,A disappointment,This film is over hyped and definitely not the best space film ever made The plot is centered around two astronauts who become stranded when their satellite is hit by debris The film follows their attempts to survive and get back to Earth While on paper the premise is solid the film is hampered by problems that leaves the viewer with a sense of mediocrity The biggest issue I have with Gravity is repetition While the first 10 minutes may be entertaining the film goes around in circles from there on I ll be hard pressed to encounter a science fiction fan who doesn t find the plot predictable and shallow Furthermore the dialogue is bland and whilst Cuaron desperately tries to give the film emotional depth a forced performance from Bullock and poor writing leave the viewer feeling nothing Perhaps the film s one redeeming factor is the technical work to create the impression of space Never before has Earth looked so real Also the audio was used to good effect to create tension and boost the action sequences Despite the technical triumph I still left the cinema feeling average No matter how pretty space looks it cannot redeem the story or the failure to connect with the audience on an emotional level,
8 October 2013,Nutshell Review: Gravity Is Something To Behold -- The New 3D Bar Has Been Set,With one white knuckle scene after another Gravity pulls you in from the opening scene and doesn t let you go until its finale It is one of the most visually stunning films I ve ever seen and not ponying up for the 3D IMAX or XD does this movie a huge injustice Gravity is the reason these movie formats were made The special effects are seamless and the sound effects are fantastic Even the brilliant use of silence The story is gripping touching scary and thought provoking and the acting superb I can t say enough about it except you need to experience it This isn t just a movie it s a moment Hat s off to the director for brilliant pacing The film never drags and is exactly how long it needs to be When I left I was exhausted from holding my breath so much and running it longer may have taken some of that away You ve been bombarded with previews and read some reviews but don t think anybody spoiled it for you The story still has not been given away and if you think you know the movie because you have seen so many previews you are very wrong Not knowing how the movie turns out is a lot of the fun It certainly is not predictable Don t trust the bad reviews Believe the hype True There is no sinister bad guy nor creepy space monster Outer space is the monster in this movie It s part of what makes this movie seem so real This is NOT a sci fi movie The space shuttle satellites and the International Space Station are all real There are no sci fi made up crafts The props represent things really in outer space and that s part of it s scary draw The story is not formulaic and laid out in front of you but that is it s appeal It is certainly there it s just a story told in a very different way It will certainly have you thinking and contemplating the important things in life In a nutshell It s like a visually fantastic summer blockbuster with Oscar appeal It s something you will be thinking about and talking about days after you see it and what more can you ask of a movie,10
5 October 2013,"If you enjoy Sci-Fi, it's not worth the hype. Go see Hubble 3D instead.",If you enjoy sci fi don t believe all the hype out there about this film While visually stunning the attempt at realism is horrid So many elements were just SO completely unrealistic that it made the movie totally unbelievable and NOT in a good way The acting was OK and only because Sandra Bullock is great at showing emotion just by breathing but other than that the story was COMPLETELY lacking I have to say I enjoyed Apollo 13 Armageddon and even Oblivion more than this piece of space garbage Save your and go see Hubble 3D at the California Science Center instead if you need a fix of stunning earth views Then you can see how real astronauts work,3

17 October 2013,the art of the moment,Gravity is a gorgeous film that must be seen in a theater unless you happen to have the world s largest screen at home and 3D capability I have to say up front that I didn t see it in 3D because I have no depth perception and wouldn t be able to see it anyway But it must have been mind boggling because without the 3D it was pretty stunning Not much here in the way of story Sandra Bullock plays a woman literally lost in space and trying to find her way back to earth via a shuttle that s rather far off The neat thing for me about this film is that the director took his time with the moments rather than rushing through and trying to have an action sequence every two seconds We watch Bullock alone as she goes through various thought processes and attempts to figure out what to do One rarely sees that type of thing anymore Bullock is excellent and it s a great role for her adventurous athletic and emotional with a few light moments George Clooney s role is small but he s likable For me though the star of this film was the beauty and the silence something that we re not used to today The silence of space the idea of complete aloneness a really beautiful movie,8

16 October 2013,An experience you won't forget.,A scientist Sandra Bullock is on her first mission in space with veteran astronaut George Clooney then there mission starts becoming one disaster after another they both have too stick together in hopes to stay alive but how long can they last in space This movie was quite an experience it makes you feel like you re in space with Clooney and Bullock at times it is intriguing at time disorientating Performances are top notch Clooney keeps the humorous moments at bay for the most part and Bullock gives a very realistic performance that is Oscar worthy If you think you ve seen it all then you have not seen Gravity,10
25 October 2013,Worst movie I have seen,Took my wife to the AMC movie theatre in Vestal NY and saw this movie expecting to see excitement from what the trailer shows Well guess what my wife fell asleep and started snoring in my ear and my favorite part was the tear drop coming at my face Complete waste of money and time Universal Studios has ultimately created a very disgraceful movie to add to their reputation Boring boring boring and at the end Sandra Bullock in her undies trying to walk that s it That the end of the damn movie Wtf was hoping to see like 3 weeks later she is at home and Clooney comes knocking on her door But whatever I do not recommend this horrible movie to anyone I wasted 23 of which could have been a good dinner at Texas Roadhouse,1
11 November 2013,Brilliant Feast of Visual Pyrotechnics that is Genuinely Scary,The plot of GRAVITY is straightforward enough Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and her astronaut companion Matt Kowalski George Clooney are left to fend for themselves in space after their craft is destroyed But this scenario belies the film s greatest virtue its quite amazing photography and visual effects All credit must be due to director Alphonso Cuaron and director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki for creating a film which watched with 3D spectacles is both scary yet compelling We feel we are lost in space with the protagonists the debris that threatens their future threatens us as well The color palette used in the film is just gorgeous I have seldom seen such views of so called Mother Earth in all its finery especially at sunrise Through this experience which is both sensual aural as well as visual we learn something about ourselves and are capacity to survive even when the odds seem stacked against us Perhaps it s just a matter of returning to a womb like state it s significant that Bullock appears in this position several times throughout the film and understanding where we came from as well as who we are GRAVITY is the best SF film I have seen in years definitely worth seeing more than once if only to savor a life changing experience,9
11 January 2014,More effects and technology than acting opportunities,I am not an eager follower of sci fi movies space dramas without real enemies to fight and the reasons I decided to watch Gravity were good actors and short duration the latter is uncommon for such movies true I had read about high praise but I did not get it under my skin Therefore I observed a pleasant and talented actress Sandra Bullock and her similar counterpart George Clooney in the course of their actions They did well as usual although Bullock had much bigger role and I recalled similar Clooney from Solaris and everything was decent good but no wow feeling As for the plot script even for me as non physicist there were too many odd phenomena and floating Post It notes and pens in the spaceship seemed more like a practical joke Of course cinematography and directing are well done but all in all with no new angles in the script and the ending s predictable nature I am unable to consider it conceptional in the movie industry just a well polished creation,7
8 October 2013,a momentous achievement that must be seen as advertised,Spectacular visually stunning space odyssey suspense thriller focusing on a medical specialist Bullock on her first space shuttle mission and a veteran astronaut Clooney commanding his final expedition and their arduous journey after an accident leaves them stranded in outer space With a setup that initially seems indistinguishable from other films in this genre there s reason to be skeptical but it immediately grabs you by the collar with a taut multilayered story of strength faith and survival and overwhelms you with some of the most arresting visual effects ever put on film If there were ever a case to justify using 3 D for a mainstream Hollywood movie this would definitely be it Bullock easily gives the finest performance of her career creating genuine pathos and conveying a gamut of emotions that have not yet been seen in her previous efforts To see it any other way than on the big screen would be an absolute crime,

10 November 2013,"Extremely Intense, Frighening & Brilliant Film",This film is a one of a kind I don t think I ve left a film emotionally drain I think I left my jaw on the ground when I left this film is seriously intense emotional frightening from the get go what s makes this brilliant is it start off with this beautiful visual Cinematography of the earth with stunning effects everything is claim then it hit you in the face with a roller coaster of intense frightening nail biting moment emotions George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky bring an outstanding performance with some emotional scene that will shock the hell out of you this is exactly what you d come to expect from the Oscar winning producer and actor like George He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale and is a perfect balance to Bullock s frantic demeanor Sandra Bullocks character you start to feel sorry for as you learn about her past but what her character is put through in this film is beyond shocking a feet of courage against all odds to survive in space I believe that this acting in this film she should get a Oscar for best supporting actress or best actress award for this film alone because her performance was outstanding really dose bring you to tears The intensely of the film alone seriously pulls you to the edge of your seat you find your self in shock as you witness the action on screen that bring a cold chill down your spine really dose bring you to cry your eyes out because the intense emotional dark concept that this film brings It also has that tragedy feel to the film which also adds to the emotional side which is why this film is one of the best film I ve seen in a long time that you will not be disappointed with I highly recommend you go watch this in 3D at the cinema because its one of the most spectacular film ever this year,10
15 October 2013,"Accidents happen, even in space.",The problem with this movie is the story It is contrived It is also an amalgam of two other movies Alien directed by Ridley Scott and 2001 A Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick The movie should be complemented for drawing on the work of two such illustrious directors Now the movie is well crafted meaning that is well made excellent cinematography good attention to details good continuity and above all a strong performance by Sandra Bullock who saves this movie from hokeydom Although she does not achieve the level of dramatic tension attained by Sigourney Weaver in Alien her performance nonetheless is worthy of positive note Basically this is Bullock s movie George Clooney plays a supportive role Actually this movie may have worked better if it had featured Bullock alone floating in space trying to survive One thing about Sandra Bullock it is hard to dislike her screen presence in any of her movies The story though is so predictable Accidents happen even in space and this movie includes some spectacular shots of things blowing up and falling apart and burning up So for a CG person this movie is wonderful Maybe the story would have been even stronger if it had contained no dialog whatsoever just a human being man or woman trapped in a space suit hundreds of miles above the earth If anyone decides to make that movie remember you got the idea from pwnycny,8
11 June 2020,Gravity,A tense climatic and stunning ride that is Gravity The effects visuals sound edting and cinematography in this film are beautiful This film is compact and almost never derives from its focuses The main Performance by Sandra Bullock is okay but she is able qato carry the film well enough The script is pretty bare and it is predictable Some may also question its realistic quality but this film is of course not without flaws The meaning of this film is the search for meaning in an a world where we are much more insignificant than we think Instead of floating away giving up and dying she powers through making something of her life This film is also about Ryan overcoming the loss of her daughter and not being held back by it The odyssey of a lonely woman overcoming fear isolation grief and the odds Visually and technically brillant decently acted predictable written bare but meaningful and throughly wondering and entertaining,8

14 December 2013,What's the hyphenated word? FAR-OUT!!!!,Gravity is a visual spectacle of technical brilliance thanks to the far out vision of Director Alfonso Cuaron The film stars Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone an engineer who is on a space mission to work on a satellite for her research Along for the el espacio ride is George Clooney as astronaut Matt Kowalksi When debris from a Russian satellite crashes into their own satellite they decide to call Direct TV for technical assistance Wait come back I am un tremendo sa te li te so you have to excuse me Anyways in reality what happens is that Dr Stone and Astronaut Kowalski get caught up in a spacely catastrophic situation and a plight to survive Cuaron s direction is the gravitational force that magnetizes the viewer into his visually brilliant Gravity Cuaron is earthbound to receive lots of love during the movie award season Bullock s mission of portraying an authentic character of a woman s fight to survive in space was superbly controlled by Madame Sandra Clooney was pretty much playing the charismatic Clooney in space but it did have enough pull to give his supporting performance worthy accolades Emmanuel Lubezki s cinematography is a sight to see and is a shoe in for a Best Cinematography Oscar Gravity deserves many stars in its review So get in your carcraft and witness it today Excellent,9
14 October 2013,A perfect combination of the beauty and horror of space,It s time to stop driving It s time to go home There are so many great things I want to say about this movie that it s very hard to decide where to begin I could mention how breathtaking and spectacular the visuals were or how powerful Sandra Bullock s performance was or how tense and gripping the film was or how well this film established its narrative structure of a simple survival story but I would have to begin by saying this is the scariest space has been since Ridley Scott s 1979 sci fi film Alien Alfonso Cuaron had several years to prepare for this film and he had big shoes to fill because his latest film Children of Men was a spectacular thriller Let me begin by saying he doesn t disappoint because Gravity is even more mind blowing than that film was The vastness and emptiness of space turns out to be the greatest villain here and Cuaron does a masterful job at letting us experience that fear on a personal level The movie is only 90 minutes long but at the end you walk out feeling physically weak after experiencing so much tension All the hype the film is getting is totally justified and not just because it s visually stunning but because it is a completely well crafted movie I thought Avatar was visually stunning but I still didn t like that movie very much so it takes more than that to get me on board and Cuaron did it thanks to a great script and a powerful performance from Sandra Bullock The tone of the film and the attention to detail is truly unique and that is what makes this film stand out above all the other thousands of space movies we ve seen The long shots Cuaron loves to incorporate in his films never worked so much to his advantage as they do here adding to the vastness of space I really want to experience this film on IMAX because I m sure it is all the more breathtaking and worthwhile This is a wonderful film that will end up on many critics top film lists Gravity manages to draw you into space and experience it in first person It is as if Cuaron put us inside Bullock s space suit and let the camera be our eyes Gravity is an overwhelming experience and one you shouldn t miss out on It is something special The plot is very simple Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer who is on her first space mission working on a satellite She went through months of training for this specific mission Matt Kowalsky George Clooney on the other hand is an experienced astronaut who is in command of this his last mission Matt is a self loving guy who enjoys every second of his work while Ryan is quiet and tries to keep to herself She seems to enjoy the quietness of space but she herself has experienced tragedy in her life and hasn t been able to move on She focuses on her work and nothing else During their routine mission Matt and Ryan receive a message from Earth telling them to return to the space shuttle as soon as possible because the debris from a satellite explosion is heading their way As we see from the trailers the debris reaches them before they can get onboard and all of a sudden Matt and Ryan are left all alone drifting through the vastness and darkness of space trying to survive Gravity may not be a character driven film but the entire movie serves as a sort of metaphor for Ryan s life She mentions how she spends most of her days simply driving around without a purpose in life and now she is drifting alone through the emptiness of space Clooney plays a supporting role here but his character plays a key role in Ryan s transformation At first she is just overwhelmed by the entire incident without a clue as to what she has to do and dependent on Matt but he manages to calm her down and convince her that she has to fight for survival Life is worth living despite the terrible incidents we experience We can either let it suck our souls and simply drift and continue on living without a purpose or we can rise to the challenge and fight those obstacles and find meaning and joy in life I think that is the core message of Gravity under all the breathtaking visual accomplishments It is a simple story about survival with an impeccable performance from Sandra Bullock breathtaking cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki The Tree of Life and it is technically perfect This is probably the closest I will ever be to experiencing space The film perfectly balances the beauty of space with its horror and you should experience it through the biggest screen your city has to offer because it is a rewarding journey,9
1 December 2013,Gripping,A solid gripping suspense drama which literally had me holding my breath This film is visually stunning with incredible effects and an attention to detail which makes you feel as if you are there It is telling that the film took so long to make because they waited until the technology was good enough to create effects that would do the story justice In a lot of modern films throw a lot of effects at you to disguise poor writing and a lack of plot in this case the story was there first and the effects are used to enhance it The film is also realistic and believable by Sci Fi standards OK there is an element of poetic license the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 and the Chinese station won t be completed until 2022 however the technical aspects of the spacecraft and stations used are close to reality Probably the best Sci fi movie I have seen this year and I say that as a huge Star Trek fan,9

11 October 2013,"Examplifies ""the magic of cinema""",With such a fantastic trailer and I do mean fantastic as compared to good trailers since most Hollywood trailers are awful anyway with such a fantastic trailer I sure wanted to see the film and yet I feared it might not be half as good as its teaser The film delivered This is just wonderful This is magnificent I don t feel the need to analyse I drowned in it I spent and still spend in my head more time enjoying the visuals and the classic universal story than wondering how the hell did the director do that To keep it short I ll just mention that I was a bit worried by the cast namely by the name of Sandra Bullocks in view of her past performances and now I know she can deliver If you worry as I did worry no more and do not miss this masterpiece,9
3 November 2013,Very intense,I don t often go to theaters but I did see this one in IMAX 3 D As expected the 3 D aspect of the film was considerably annoying but the IMAX aspect was awesome Clooney largely played himself not that there is anything wrong with that Sandra Bullock was fantastic particularly considering that most of what was around her and that she was reacting to were not there at filming but added in post production While there were certainly some plot holes and the physics were not one hundred percent accurate the filmmakers went out of their way to demonstrate on of the big problems about working in microgravity that is the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum Poor Dr Stone got just beaten all to hell trying to stop and perhaps they should have put some bruise make up on Bullock for that But then again the film only spans maybe two hours of time Anyway the film is very intense,9
5 January 2020,Edge of your seat from start to finish!,There was actually one reveiwer that gave this film 1 star based on it being intellectually challenged and went on to write a book about how smart they were and how no one with an above average IQ would enjoy this film Which prompted me to write this feedback for their egotistical tirade As an individual with above average IQ I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film immensely The film did exactly what it was intended to do keep me at the edge of my seat with intensified suspense Only an egotistical mentality will cause one to overthink a sci fi movie Movies are for the purpose of entertainment and I was thoroughly entertained by this film High IQ or not when someone gives a film of this quality a one star it s not the problem of the film but the problem of the viewer Plain and simple Personally I feel bad for those one star individuals because they don t even understand that they are the problem not the movie If you like an intense film experience then by all means watch this film Don t judge it based on your preconceived notions of what you think it should be but sit back and enjoy the ride for what it is,10
3 April 2023,Good Suspense & Good Acting,The film keeps viewers on the edge of their seat from the beginning to its conclusion with great suspense One great thing about this film is that it presents a story in space that is more realistic and close to our current time period which is a nice change from most other space shows One minor complaint is that the story is not very optimistic Something I have come to enjoy from many space shows is the sense of optimism for a future for humanity in space as we get from shows like Star Trek The Next Generation That said the story also isn t exactly pessimistic either As a nice short space movie there s really nothing wrong with it Good acting good suspense Perhaps even a little inspirational,8
29 November 2013,"Great film, don't listen to the wannabe geeks and hipsters",1 how many self proclaimed geeks have attacked this movie with flimsy arguments about the science behind it They must have hated 2001 A Space Odyssey and just about every film set in space ever Note to self Never listen to a self proclaimed geek when it comes to movies 2 A number of hipsters have submitted reviews critiques that criticize the plot or dialogue What did they expect A conspiracy Wow people have really lost touch with the meaning of survival in this post modern era One reviewer complained CSS doesn t exist to which I say nor did the USS Enterprise Star Trek or the Discovery 1 2001 At least the CSS is actually in the works in the rel world Reviewers who don t understand the concept of FICTION probably shouldn t be making them about fiction films The movie was spectacular First the physics of zero gravity and space travel were spot on probably the best ever on screen Second the plot was moving not because there were conspiracies or fantasy elements but because it was more about human survival and perseverance in the most inhospitable environment known to man Bullock was surprisingly good out of her normal role as a romantic interest of some rich New Yorker Clooney was both firm as a mission commander and comical as a human which helped the film get going and in a wise move by the director his role was surprisingly short in the film dampening any negative aspects of his character While perhaps not perfect this film was damn close 9 10,9
16 January 2014,Really?,Movie was awful George Clooney was decent but Sandra Bullock just ruined it She did not act good enough for me to believe that her character was smart enough to become an astronaut Her characters lack of IQ completely ruined it No country would ever send someone to space with the derpness that her character had If her character was smart enough to be an astronaut then why aren t my cats floating around in space right now Some people liked the movie because of how beautiful the shots of the movie were but have they not seen anything else with space shots in it I m not even going to bring up how parts of the movie weren t even close to being realistic,1
21 October 2013,Space. Tragedy. Survival. A Visual Masterpiece.,Gravity 3D 9 10 Space Tragedy Survival Gravity is nothing less than a visual masterpiece None of the movies in this genre have given me such an interesting view The only life like viewing experience prior to this was in Imax s Space Station 3D 2002 Anyway Gravity does live up to its name and grips the viewers for its runtime of 90 minutes Alfonso Cuar n gives us with such a great presentation with amazing direction and beautiful cinematography The direction is smooth and steady Specially the first person view It actually feels that you are living the movie George Clooney gives a classic performance Who sips vodka in a god forsaken shuttle just after the tragedy He takes the show Sandra Bullock has gives one of her best performances It shows A courageous medical engineer There are handful of scenes that would bring a smile to your face over all the tragedy that strikes and one of them is when Phaldut Sharma who plays Shariff the 3rd astronaut hums the classic Mera Joota Hai Japani Gravity does catch the eye 3D effects are perfect From the spark of fire to the drop of a tear Full marks for 3D All in all a perfect visual experience with a gripping and interesting storyline and screenplay Totally recommended Just as the tag line says Don t Let Go,9
7 April 2021,A roller coaster ride in space! (wait... wouldn't a roller coaster in space just sit there? um...),Gravity launches right into the action in the opening scene and doesn t let up In that respect it s the most straightforward no nonsense nothing about politicians or shady corporations space thriller out there If you want to watch a straightforward realistic flick about survival without any contrived plot twists then look no further Sandra Bullock plays Ryan an inexperienced but intelligent scientist on her first mission when things go horribly awry Her character also has a very pessimistic spin very unusual for a protagonist in a survival flick in that she s a real gloomy self defeating nihilist So if not fighting against the icy vaccuum of space with occasional killer projectiles and exploding things half the battle is Ryan fighting against her own nature to give up That s what gives this film depth even though you can choose to watch it as a straightforward action type story George Clooney plays Matt the commander of the mission and the upbeat gabby antithesis to Ryan s relative hopelessness This balances the ratio of pessimism to optimism giving the audience an interesting contrast to ponder in the face of disaster Although this is really Sandra Bullock s flick Clooney s presence is memorable It should be noted that action special effects aside this is a very minimalistic film with Bullock Clooney being pretty much the only actors Which brings us to the action special effects Fantastic Visuals are believable even though I m sure a lot of the physics was exaggerated for dramatic effect we never feel like this is a cheesy Hollywood crowd pleaser with pew pew laser guns did you catch the Austin Powers finger quotes As long as you don t watch this flick sitting next to an actual rocket scientist or some uptight date who is too busy worrying about the parking meter that he can t lose himself in magic of movies then you ought to have an enjoyable experience I would compare this flick to the classics 2010 The Year We Make Contact and Apollo 13 in its approach The minimalism reminded me of the excellent film Moon 2009 the way a single character can carry an entire story The pacing of action is something like you d see in Sunshine 2007 For anyone who thinks modern scifi is overrun by Transformers cheese and pew pew laser beams check out this film as well as the others I mentioned Gravity won t LET YOU DOWN insert groans,8
21 October 2013,The movie which gives you a losing of gravity!,Before watching this movie i expected a great work of cinematographer Lubezki is a master of putting you deeply inside a movie s world but i couldn t even imagine that it was possible to give a such realistic world with a camera I love sci fi movies but only 2 or 3 of them are really interesting It s difficult to believe that a such story can happen in life but this thoughts crossing a mind if to analyze too serous The movie is so thrilling and realistic that it s perceived without doubts during watching Music is a great add to the movie,9

27 November 2013,One of the films of the year. This is the platform for future space films.,Contains mild peril is the brief accompanying the release of Gravity however the problem with this vague statement is that it doesn t tell you if that is aimed towards the characters of the film or the audience members It also doesn t help that to me being cast adrift in space with nothing to grab a hold of doesn t sound like mild peril it sounds mega peril to me For ninety one minutes Gravity does not hold up Even the calmer moments are filled with peril because let s face it would any of you want to work on the side of a space craft in the depths of space This film has it all tension action stunning visuals strong performances catharsis cheese and tears It is only ninety minutes but boy does it cover some ground Or space ground Or no ground Sandra Bullock is Doctor Ryan Stone that s right apparently her parents were hoping for a boy a sure fire sign she has parent issues a first time space traveller brought onto the last mission of Matt Kowalski a veteran astronaut who is determined to break the record of the most hours accumulated space walking Stone is fragile struggling to cope with her new environment whilst Kowalski sees it all as a zero gravity playing field that is however until debris from a broken down satellite sparks a chain reaction in Earth s orbit and sends shrapnel heading straight for them On destruction of their ship the two astronauts are left to float with one objective in mind making it back home What instantly sets Gravity apart from the rest is the stunning visual element that Cuar n has used in telling this story Not only does it look breathtaking on the big screen it also does justice to the use of 3D Most films use it as a gimmick or a cash grab but with Gravity it feels entirely necessary Cuar n wants you cast adrift as much as the characters are and by creating greater depth he has achieved just that In 2D it is bound to still look stunning but in comparison it may look flat The sound is also critical to the development of the film The non digetic sound is loud building to a climax that leaves you in silence It pounds along hinting towards the sense of danger and adds to the tension soon to come The digetic sound on the other hand is quiet dull and non existent Other then hearing the characters through their radios the atmospheric sound is as if you were in space with them Drills are muffled The destruction of space stations is made with a whimper What Cuar n has done is given the audience the feel that they are right there alongside them and all by providing sound possibly recorded through a wooden door Mild peril is as much for the audience as it is those characters The acting must also be applauded especially from the inconsistent Bullock At times her choice of movie has baffled many but here she proves why she is A list Having little to work with in terms of stage surroundings she conveys the traits and internal conflicts of Stone as if she were real What is incredible is that the character is fairly generic and has little in terms of back story but little is all Bullock needs to work with as she convinces that Stone has a past and is determined to reach the future for the sake of all she has been through We are right there with her and if you don t will her to survive then Cuar n has failed to immerse you which I find highly doubtful Clooney is also the arrogant contrast to Stone and is the cool calm charmer that we expect from him His character is less developed but he is there to shift the attention to Bullock who is left to drive home the themes of human nature and how having little going for your life doesn t stop you fighting for survival Every elements of the film is of the highest standard The weakest element is possibly the script with the ham fisted dialogue but Cuar n and son get away with this due to the awe inspiring visuals That is not to say the visuals should make a story better but when an entire space station is ripped apart to the sound of echoing silence within the frame with a solitary female astronaut floating in the middle of it all attempting to avoid certain death then I think one or two corny one liners can certainly be forgiven If you haven t seen this yet then don t wait for the DVD get yourself out there and see it on the big screen to experience it in all its glory All the elements make up for a fascinating original movie which the film world is seeing less and less of each year You want to sit on the edge of your seat for ninety minutes being dragged through space than this is the film for you It is the closest experience to a fairground ride I have had in the cinema Do not miss it It is one of the movies of the year Rating 5 5 Directing Cuar n s camera decisions have you floating right there with the characters Acting Bullock gives the performance of her life Clooney oozes charm Script The weakest element of the entire production but isn t deterring in the slightest Cinematography Stunning absolutely stunning The use of light is a contrast to their situation Score Loud but silent You just won t understand till you hear it through big blaring speakers Editing This was edited Wasn t it all done in one shot The first 13 minutes certainly were Overall One of the films of the year This is the platform for future space films,10
6 October 2013,A Discovery Channel Popcorn Movie.,I really wanted this film to be provocative beautiful and entertaining 1 out of 3 isn t bad It really was gorgeous to look at in IMAX 3D My son who is 15 said it reminded him of something they would watch at space camp or one of those IMAX tourist traps I have to agree I have seen some wonderful IMAX films at places like Disney and other theme parks It s a shame that that is really all there is to this film At a buck fifty running time there is no depth to this film funny because it is set in unlimited space But it is pretty straight forward Good looking tang people are working in space Houston they have a problem now it becomes a survival flick The actors were pretty well cast However there wasn t a lot to do in an hour plus film without even a Wilson in it to talk too I know a vast majority of movie patrons will feel it was pretty straight forward and thus underwhelming other than visually But there will be those that try to find symbolism and meaning within this film While I am not one to shy away from an Look what the director did there moment there has to be more than viewer speculation to make a great film I almost felt like he didn t want to fill an extra thirty minutes with non dialogue scenes and relying on Sandra to keep the audience interested There was a film with half the visual money shots called MOON that never worried about the audience losing interest To be fair this is a wonderful condensed version of what adrift in space would feel like However once it turns into the POSEDION ADVENTURE meets APOLLO 13 you can understand why it won t be remembered for its storytelling,7
31 December 2020,Great visuals but weak story and utterly implausible,I m baffled at the rave reviews Sure for 2013 it was visually stunning That does not excuse the weak writing storyline The characters are barely developed Bullock s character survives one implausible event after another So implausible that frankly the viewer s intelligence is insulted Her emotional shift near the end wasn t believable and the ending was lame and unsatisfying A 7 7 Sheesh Even a superhero movie has more depth,3
7 October 2013,"Technically stunning, but horrifying symbolically",Technically this film is stunning Lots of good portrayals of microgravity with very few gaffes some of which were clearly thrown in for nice visual effects like a helmet staying stationary in the center of a rotating and accelerating landing module Orbital mechanics are also totally bungled beyond repair 1 You won t see debris that hits you at hyper sonic speed it s too fast to track with your eyes 2 There s no way to generate such a dense debris fields even if you destroy all the satellites Besides it ll take days for fragments from a satellite explosion to collide with other satellites 3 And of course flying from Hubble telescope to the ISS using jetpack is impossible they have wildly different orbit inclinations and heights 4 To overtake an object far in front of you in orbit you actually need to brake this will lower your orbit and you ll move faster Then you need to re boost your orbit for rendezvous If you accelerate towards the object instead of braking then you ll actually be moving away from it because you ll boost yourself to a higher orbit with a longer orbital period 5 Astronauts might lose contact with Huston for a short time but communication with the ISS and Shuttles is actually done through ground stations not satellites And suit radio is powerful enough that ground based amateur radio operators can actually tune and listen to it OK these are minor details Were they the only problems I d give this film 10 stars But I absolutely loathe the symbolics of this movie It s anti space and anti intellectual The whole movie tells you ll never live in space it s sinister It ll kill you You only hope is to crawl back to Earth Technology is powerless It can t even allow you to talk to your fellow humans on Earth Your only hope is to believe in angels you can talk with them The final scene is the most iconic to reach the surface she actually had to shed all of the stuff touched by the space The space suite was dragging her down And in the one final attempt the parachute tried to engulf and drown her For this imagery and anti progress attitude I give this film only 3 stars,3
21 November 2013,Visually Stunning & Beautifully Crafted,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
7 February 2014,This is NOT A DOCUMENTARY of a space crisis.,People should really stop trend bashing or raving for that matter The message of this movie is NOT about physics facts and realism Otherwise every single scifi movie ever made should be scrutinized It is science FICTION This is a movie about coping with tragedy Never giving up To everyone who scrutinizes and complains about how scientifically inaccurate and improbable this movie is well if that s what gets you off I respect that But to those who are looking to be inspired to those who listen for a message s intent and not studiously scan for grammatical errors to simply learn This is a wonderful movie,9

4 October 2013,Gavity Astounds,Gravity I went into this film knowing what it was about and having read the reviews saying it was a great film The reviews were rights Gravity is visual feast for the eyes With such a simplistic setting Space and plenty of material to work with Gravity surprises time and again The story is fairly simplistic A space engineer and an astronaut are doing some repairs to the Hubble Space telescope when space debris comes hurtling at them like a bullets separating them from the space shuttle what follows is a hectic calm Yes its hectic but the cinematography and special effects are amazing The attention to the detail pays off as you can see water droplets clearly I saw the 3 d version which I recommend but even if you don t see it on 3 d it s a still one beautiful movie The acting by Sandra Bullock is impressive I wouldn t be surprised if she gets a Oscar nod out of this Clooney is Clooney he s capable With such a slim cast and simplistic setting Gravity will hold your attention and leave you in awe,10

17 October 2013,The closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves,Gravity is a strange mixture of the ridiculous and the sublime For me the latter eclipsed the former almost all the way along the beauty wonder and grandeur of the film let me quickly forgive the few truly facepalmy moments Let s start with the bad and get it out of the way What little story there is here is completely linear paper thin and relies on howlingly bad science to create a crisis and then howlingly bad science to resolve it The few characters are presented as professional astronauts yet as introduced two of the three behave more like twenty somethings on a package holiday Did I mention how oh God the science is really bad It s the astrodynamics that suffers the worst all kinds of ludicrous orbital impossibilities are depicted I know it s only a movie and supposed to be a fun way to spend 90 odd minutes but I found this stuff as jarring as a movie set on terra firma where a hoodlum on a skateboard in New York snatches a handbag darts off down the street and in the next scene is swapping the skateboard for a bicycle in Beijing It really is that bad indeed it s actually worse than that except when the science is really good The title Gravity is perhaps a little misleading because gravity doesn t directly play much part in the film Rather it s Conservation of Angular Momentum that s a recurring theme For the most part aside of one very very obvious and annoying gaffe Newtonian mechanics are well respected and I found the terror and desperation of characters in the grips of the cold equations palpable at times So what else does this movie do right Well for a start I think it s the most beautiful cinematic depiction of space since 2001 A Space Odyssey the cinematography is stunning in an enlarge any frame and hang it on your wall kind of way It really has been 40 years since space has looked this good The vistas of Earth from orbit are really breathtaking in particular a gorgeous panorama of Egypt sticks in my mind As I was watching that sequence I was wishing a little that all attempts at a story had just been excised from the finished film Set to a mellow jazz or classical score I think I could watch those spacescapes for hours and hours Finally I found its depictions of real or close to real space hardware and working in microgravity really really convincing and immersive When a character loses a tool at a crucial moment I like they had a very strong sense of panic about not ever ever getting it back And it s the spacecraft of the film a space shuttle a Soyuz TMA and a Shenzhou all lovingly rendered and presented that to me were perhaps the real stars of the show To me these felt like real spacecraft and I felt like I was there aboard them I highly highly recommend this movie You might get into the survival story I could take it or leave it but I think it was credibly done but watching this on the big screen in 3D is likely to be the closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves,9
26 October 2013,Visually stunning and a beautiful performance from Sandra Bullock,I was gripped from the opening 10 seconds It was at that time I realised there was something different about Gravity Outside the movie theatre I wasn t absolutely sure what to go and see and it came down to a toss up between Escape Plan and Gravity I wasn t in the mood for what I assumed would be wisecracks explosions and fighting so I hoped that Gravity wold be one of those movies that really immerses you in the experience I made the right choice from the opening sequence I was drawn in firstly by the visuals and then slowly but surely by the brilliant acting of Sandra Bullock an actress of whom I have been rather dismissive in the past George Clooney was actually nicely understated I think the space suits reduced the possibilities of either character being out acted and promoted the dialogue to the fore Having said previously I wasn t up for wisecracks explosions and fighting I guess ultimately I got all that but not in the traditional sense I will go and see this movie again and rave about it to friends the perfect timing for the perfect movie and I say again for me Sandra Bullock was a revelation,9

7 October 2013,Fantastic movie making,In Hong Kong the promotion of this film stated that various film critics given this film very high score I just saw the empire magazine and it was given 5 stars the highest So I was excited to go to see this film in IMAX 3D on a Monday night show The story is straight forward it s an episode film to me meaning there is only one main thing happen throughout the movie and the director s job is to guide you through it with all the abilities he she can and let you feel that it s happening to you and you are right at the center of it and this movie done it perfectly From the opening to the ending scene you are immersed into the events happen to the main character With spectacular and stunning view of the earth and the space you are so absorbed into it and feels like you are at space with them I won t go into details but the story is solid and the acting from both Clooney and Bullock is good But this is basically a one man or should I say woman show as most of the time you can only see Sandra Bullock on the screen so it puts lots of stress onto the actress because the success of the film solely depend on her but she did a beautiful job One more thing I think that this story is visually stunning but at the same time it told about the importance of courage to live on no matter how desperate you think you are Because help may come from places you never expected P S remember to watch it in 3D As big as a screen you can find,9
7 November 2013,"Fantastic visuals, stilted writing",Gravity is worth your money just for the opening scene In a world where movies are plagued by directors producers who think any shot longer than 5 seconds is dreadfully boring yes you Michael Bay keeping the camera perfectly steady for at least two minutes is an amazingly daring approach that turned out to be a brilliant fetch It immediately captures your attention by doing everything Hollywood hates that s ironic but not very it s a magnificent opening There are more breath taking scenes spread throughout the movie visually it s an amazing experience and it actually shows us that movies like these can be made for other reasons than just to show of new technologies The technical side is amazing but it s also functional and that s something a lot of movies seem to forget In the second half however this movie s flaws really come into play The screenplay is just really mediocre when you take away how fantastic the movie looks it s really just a basic tearjerker with an absolutely terrible ending The character development doesn t flow at all it s just thrown into there as forcibly as possible as they kinda hope nobody notices What s the significance of Bullock s character losing her child anyway Isn t being lost in space with no oxygen enough drama to keep the plot going I stared in awe at the first half but the second half just doesn t add up Movie of the year Visually yes but I don t know if that s enough,7
17 November 2021,Pure cinema,Think about this I don t remember much of this film but I do remember being blown away by it I saw it in IMAX The story don t remember it So it s weakness lies in the fact that there isn t a lot of emotional connection to the main character additionally not many people can relate to being in space even though knowing how artists work being in space alone is cleary a life metaphor Point being the immersve experience of this film is precisely why cinema was invented I should watch it again but I remember this film very fondly perhaps one weakness of the film is I remember being blown away by the visceral experience but I don t have any genuine yearning to rewatch,9

14 March 2014,A fantastic flick - Should not be missed!,it took me about 2 days to get the words about this movies its awesome even if you watch it in 720p it will make it the same but you will regret that why didn t you watched it in 3d it a perfect movie for any age group there are some punches by George Clooney to make you a bit but it makes it more serious the movie is full of emotional and action scenes especially when Sandra Bullock sees George Clooney in her dream and it gives a new spirit to the adventure before watching the movie you think that life in space is easy and fun when the movie ends you say to your friends or family that it was the best movie the next day you wake up you start feeling differently you think what was that and you start remembering the scenes and those who have not seen the movie you have a hell of a story to tell for me i give it 4 and a half stars and this flick deserves a sequel,9
25 November 2013,Much better than I excepted,On the paper this movie didn t seem that interesting but I decided to bite the bullet and go watch this on 3D and oh boy what an exciting ride it was Never before a movie with only two characters have been so interesting and exciting that you actually felt sorry that it ended already Yes maybe there were one or two too many close calls so it started to feel a bit outdated already but anyhow this was the best movie I have seen in theaters for a long time Also the 3D actually first time worked in this one It was much better than even in Avatar which was the previous movie where 3D actually brought something to the table,9
13 January 2017,Gripping,The suspense got me because I honestly didn t know what would happen It didn t occur to me that the only 2 people in the film were Sandra Bullock and George Clooney it didn t need any more The outcome was not predetermined and I felt that anything could happen even at the end The CGI was obviously very impressive Having now seen the International Space Station on TV from the perspective of British astronaut Tim Peake I think I probably got more out of this than if I had seen it beforehand I knew that if an astronaut is floating in space they have to grab one of the handles on the outside of the space craft and preferably tether themselves to it I wasn t surprised to see Russian writing in the Soyuz and that Sandra Bullock s character was not fazed by that she was trained I feel that the response of a highly professional scientist to a dire emergency in space was realistic Even though she was facing death she remained relatively calm most of the time Recently I have had cancer and faced death myself The calmness shown in this film is genuine and believe it or not it is possible to be accepting I am getting better by the way In summary I found this movie very exciting gripping and believable almost The disaster may not be realistic but the human response to it was convincing I applaud the achievement,8

3 November 2013,Very Good Movie,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
11 October 2013,Overrated eye candy combined with failed drama,Let s get it out of the way this film has beautiful effects and camera shots especially in IMAX 3D I wanted to like this movie I wanted to be immersed in it and live in a different world for a little while I was unable to do that so let me try to save you the same disappointment The first problem is with the mission team We have one man in a prototype jet pack zooming around without a tether while telling rambling stories another man bouncing around on a tether like a child giddy with zero g excitement and a woman attempting to install a device into the Hubble telescope Houston repeatedly asks the woman how she is doing since her vitals are concerning it turns out she is very uncomfortable in space and is trying not to freak out or throw up She is unable to get the device successfully installed What What kind of astronaut team is this Soon things go bad for a vaguely plausible reason Here at 10 in the film ceases to be about space science science fiction humanity relationships or anything interesting and becomes a story about one person s inability to cope In the foreground there are of course the eye candy the explosions and the jarring soundtrack but the drama is forced mainly by character flaw and comes across as overblown and surprisingly misogynistic The protagonist is also the antagonist Bleh This director did a great job with Children of Men so I guess he should stick to adaptations For a better experience check out Space Cowboys or the 3D film at the Kennedy Space Center of real astronauts doing the real thing which I found much more immersive and exciting,4
13 November 2013,One of the most beautiful experiences of any art form. Unlike anything I have ever seen,I wasn t sure really what to expect from Gravity I did have high expectations and it s clear from Alfonso Cuaron s last film Children of Men that he is an exciting director and makes interesting films Gravity is way beyond that It is unlike anything I have ever seen At heart it is a film about an individual s endurance and shear will to survive nothing we haven t seen before but it s the almost perfect execution that makes this film a masterpiece First of all this is a visual film Every visual element comes together like cogs so that the finished product looks and feels extraordinary The way the camera moves pace directionality the way the focus shifts the way the film is lit the set pieces all add up to what is visually speaking the film equivalent of an opera And I never thought I d say this but the 3D makes up one of those cogs sometimes not quite moving in quite close harmony with the others but very rarely was that the case 3D for me has rarely been immersive and never would I have described an entire 3D film as being that until now Rarely does a shot look noticeably out of focus such is the norm with 3D The vast vast majority only adds to the beauty and wonder of the overall visual experience Cuaron gets 3D the slow moving shots allow for an adjustment of focus that is seamless In fact I d go as far as to say that to see the film in 2D would be to miss a large part of what makes the film so stunning Secondly while I ll admit that the plot itself and dialogue are perhaps clunky at best I didn t care The lack of any sort of plot isn t an issue the film is following the character on a short journey and as explained above you really do feel like you re right there in space watching There are plenty of films where there is a lack of narrative That is not an issue The dialogue in this film needs to serve only as a commentary on what is going on to fill in any blanks which I ll admit people may have a problem with and it does get a little cheesy I didn t care I was rarely listening to what was being said I was more interested on what I was watching yes the stunning visuals but also the plight of the character which was enthralling Also Sandra Bullock does enough to make the character come alive right here in the present so that the dialogue is largely redundant anyway and any backstory not necessary I found I was emotionally invested in George Clooney s character as soon as any threat began because it felt so real not just because of the visuals but because of the weight of the acting and the threat itself Lastly I ll say that I haven t been as emotionally exhausted by a film in a very long time if ever I certainly have never felt so emotionally up and down watching a film I probably laughed cried and felt anxious short of having a heart attack several times in several different orders in the space of just 10 minutes of the film The threat feels real and while I ll admit that people might find the continued frustration the film makes you feel annoying I do think that is the point the film sets out to be frustrating it is part of the constant emotional roller coaster clich I know but it s also an appropriate way to physically describe the film you feel like you re sitting on while watching it and only adds to the realism of the threat Importantly Gravity doesn t feel like a typical sci fi film It could be set anywhere where there is sustained mortal threat and I m sure there are numerous films one could cite to show that in terms of narrative and theme it does nothing new It does not pretend to be profound or even particularly clever but it does exactly what it sets out to do show the plight of an individual though sustained trauma alone and terrified and I can t fault the result for what it is though maybe I m missing something I tend to be overly critical of almost every film I see and I could count of two hands the number of films I have ever considered to be 10 10 films I genuinely think this is one of them From the opening shot I was in awe of the visuals I have never seen anything that comes close to the spectacle of Gravity From the moment the threat began I was scared frustrated happy depressed overjoyed not necessarily in that order and several times over I consider it almost mandatory that a film provokes some sort of emotional response whether laughter crying happiness or even depression One of the worst things a film can make you feel is cold Gravity provoked emotional response and involvement in abundance and it makes me love it even more I will say that I m sure that it would be different on a small screen in my own home in 2D than in a cinema in 3D and that would impact the entire experience of the film though I m sure that this is true of almost every film these days but probably never as true as with Gravity I left genuinely feeling a sense of having had all of my emotional limits tested one by one unrelentingly in such a small space of time on top of having witnessed the most stunning visuals I had ever seen as well as every aspect of the film with the possible exception of the dialogue having come together to form something that most closely resembles opera I hate to use the word experience it sounds too cheesy but it best describes how I think of the way Gravity plays in a cinema in 3D For that experience 10 10,10
20 October 2013,Save your money! (and 1.5hrs of your time).,Gravity was a great disappointment The studio must have paid shills to write glowing reviews so we can waste our hard earned money on this junk Given that I was there in the 60 s when the real Apollo missions were unfolding and worked for the company Grumman Aircraft that built the LEM Lunar Excursion Module that actually landed on the moon I am a little more than familiar with space technology and what can and cannot happen The first real space movie was Kubrik s 2001 A Space Odyssey which to this day hold a high place in my heart which Gravity failed in every way to capture my appreciation for what I hoped for and really wanted it to be a great movie I paid extra to see the IMAX 3D version and was not disappointed with the CGI special effects and the implementation of 3D The 3D wasn t abused like so many other 3D movies just for the sake of being 3D No feeling of having to duck when objects are flying at you out of the screen It actually was one of the best implementation of 3D movies I ve seen next to Avatar The CGI was stunning realistic and believable This is the only good thing I can say about this movie Now for the story line or the lack of one My 10 year old niece could have written a better script After the initial 15 minutes the believability factor started to fade real quick As they say it does not compute It starts off as a mission to upgrade one of the satellites where things started to go wrong I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the plot to expand and to develop Unfortunately I waited for 1 5 hours and it never came The ending left me thinking what happened to the rest of the movie Will there be a Part 2 which will complete it I wished there was a money back guarantee for movies I would have been first in line Total waste of my time,1
16 April 2014,"Possibly a little over hyped, but a very good film.",Has to be the most realistic screen portrayal of life in zero g Ever But even so it is not totally realistic as the director occasionally claims artistic license with the laws of physics The story could be accused of lacking depth but it is a story well executed By the standards of most science fiction films it s practically War And Peace I take the general theme of the film to be about walking through the fire taking strength from adversity Some of the dialogue is corny But that s not why you watch this film It is an extremely visual piece with everything in it the special effects the sets the models and Sandra Bullock being extremely beautiful As such do not bother watching it on a phone or a dodgy TV set That would be a total waste of time,8
6 December 2013,"Compelling, Exciting, Stunning and spare - perfect",I love hard science fiction where what you see is entirely within the laws of physics a re made true universe in which human beings are subjected to the most unusual of true circumstances not found on earth The level of accuracy here is quite amazing and only minor truths are changed to advance the plot and keep it compact and breathlessly well paced Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney shine in this spare and amazingly well paced movie This is not a 90 minute movie stretched to 2 5 hours this is a 90 minute movie presented as it happens Outstanding Ms Bullock s best ever role after a mostly wasted career in my rarely humble opinion She is a mission specialist not a full blown astronaut with limited space training as compared to Mr Clooney s faultless performance as the seasoned true spaceman The balance between their performances is nuanced and true This is the first movie after the jungle scenes in Avatar which truly benefits from the 3D treatment I wish we could return to active shutter 3D glasses the current ones noticeably reduce brightness and color sadly But nonetheless the 3D adds amazing depth in the optical airlessness of space I also found shades of the first Ripley re born in Ms Bullock s space girl She truly grows in the roll before our eyes showing that women truly can be just as competent and creative as any man I award this movie my highest rating See it on the big screen NOW,10
27 February 2014,Very intense,I was skeptical about this movie i thought it was the story of one women in space trying to save herself and the amazing is that it is a girl alone in space trying to save herself but at a level of intensity that you just can t stop watching this movie to all the people that are skeptical like i was please watch this movie it is worth it You will live with here all the movie it has an amazing soundtrack and the visual effects are amazing you will feel like you re in space and everything that happens it s happening to you you live as the character and you feel as you were lost like her Once again see this movie,8
10 October 2013,"If you love space, you'll like this movie; If you like this movie, you'll love space.",I usually don t bother writing reviews when there s heaps and heaps of them already but as for this one I thought it is so deserving and thrill filled I m going to thrown one in First things first as soon as I read the tag line In space no one can hear you scream and half way through the trailer I wanted to watch this movie right away and I did I m not a fan of 3D cause it kinda gives me the headache and I don t usually enjoy them but as soon as Gravity embarked on I changed my mind and I couldn t believe what I was watching through those glasses I was in the front row chose to be and I can t tell how amazing the view of the earth from the Sky is The CGI is so admirable and I m sitting here wondering what they had to do to accomplish the level of realism and the wonderful sights make you believe it IS shot inspace So half the time I was impressed just by the CGI it was almost an experience in itself The movie takes you into varied emotions and a bit of chemistry between two lost souls in space director did a good job with the very very suspenseful story The movie is also fairly accurate with the laws of physics except for here and there but that s OK if you re a rocket scientist then you should probably ignore flaws and eat your popcorn it s a movie to begin with I don t understand some of the outright negative critiques well maybe it s just that they don t enjoy Space or just that they are simply emotionless I didn t find a single second where I thought it was boring Go ahead and watch it and see it for yourself,10
5 March 2014,Simplicity and monumentality rarely seen in today's CG movies,Amid the piles of kitsch and cramming Gravity brings some fresh air in Hollywood through its simplicity One of the best representations of Space in the history of cinematography further enriched with long uninterrupted shots the opening shot lasts some 20 minutes complementary auditive landscapes and monumental pictures which create an outstanding experience Despite some clich d situations in the scenario the bare fact that the actress is the central figure for the most part of the film that there is no a forcibly imposed love story without an excess of pathos additional characters and explosions we can conclude that it s a miracle that such a CG film has happened in nowadays Hollywood,8
21 May 2021,Worst space movie,The leading lady Ryan stone played dumb character and how can someone travel to space without the basic knowledge of space station and space craft Expect VFX work nothing was watchable,1

20 October 2013,It's no Miss Congeniality.,I want to start out by saying I m a huge Bullock fan That being said I can t say I really loved or even liked this film I get that it s a sci fi movie but I was still expecting some of those classic Sandy one liners that made movies like The Proposal and Miss Congeniality both the original and Armed and Fabulous so great Knowing that Clooney was going to be backing her up I was like you kidding me this is basically going to be The Proposal in space But I was wrong I was very very wrong Suddenly I found myself watching something more along the lines of Speed 2 Cruise Control I was completely blown away and the camera wouldn t stop moving I haven t seen special effects like that in a long time I can t believe she could put out something as enjoyable as The Heat and this terrible thing in the same year It was very upsetting,1
25 December 2013,One of the most boring films I have ever watched,With all the great reviews I read for this movie I was expecting to watch a wonderful entertaining movie I was absolutely bored to death What a waste of space Did those who wrote glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie The dialog between the characters was so boring as were the characters Bullock s character Dr Ryan Stone is emotionally unprepared and was impossible to believe no reasonable explanation was ever given as to why she was selected for the mission It was so slow I fell asleep several times Just wish I had a remote to fast forward it to the good bits Unfortunately that would not have helped,1

9 January 2019,Great movie,I think you are all being a little hard on this movie It was met for entertainment and delivered,10
4 March 2014,take a breath....with this film....let the breath out,What is this universe its not just some space time game but its a thing far more difficult to handle practically This difficult at its basic form marks the pathway of Gravity Few men game this film will take u through the fantastic and stringent situations with a touch of spirituality The river Ganga ganges bhagawan Buddh Jesus Christ in space stations ask us about the presence of other reality beyond life and stuffs but not going flown into that it show the humans lives how they evolve get guidance suffer and succeed and all these things packed in a beautiful 3 d effects to make us feel that we stand on the Earth while our Earth stands nowhere so basically we are actually important but we are nothing actually,10
6 April 2014,Terrible Movie,This was the worst movie I have seen especially to have Sandra Bullock and George Clooney starring in this It was a total waste of money and time There should have been more to this movie more excitement more at the end when she landed wherever that was I would not waste my time and money on this movie it isn t worth it There should have at least been some kind of love connection or something going on between those two but it was very boring and was not worth seeing It should have at least had some ground work laid out at the beginning of the movie to give you an idea of how they got to where they were etc but nothing like that at all It starts out being boring and kept being boring through the whole movie IT didn t even have anything at the end when she landed which might have helped the rest of it from being so boring if there would have been more to the end of the movie such as she lands gets out of the water then goes SOMEWHERE would have been nice if George would have shown up which would not have left everyone thinking he died IT REALLY NEEDED MORE,1
24 October 2013,Tour de force of a Space Epic. Highly Entertaining,Gravity 90 wonderful minutes Sandra Bullock Dr Ryan Stone George Clooney Matt Kowalski Ed Harris Mission Control voice Gravity is not only one of the best movies about space ever made it is one of the best movies ever made period From the opening until the end the moviegoer is held in the spellbinding grip of this magnificent film Gravity deserves every Oscar that can be forged it is just that good There are no gratuitous sex scenes no sappy bullshit no corporate logos or political innuendos in this film just 90 minutes of gripping spellbinding entertainment This is one of the tightest movies I have ever seen not one second wasted no fluff no quarter and no pause From the moment you are in your seat prepare to stay there and prepare to be absorbed by this tour de force of a film The attention to detail is absolutely amazing it s about the best I have ever seen My popcorn and every edible half popped kernel was consumed in the first 30 minutes and any thoughts of relieving an aching bladder during this film were discarded as the cinematic greatness manifested itself throughout the entire 90 minutes Sandra Bullock was wonderful in this role certainly an award winning performance from beginning to end I will try really hard to avoid Spoilers here but this film is brutally real as there is no saving the day or head turning suspension of disbelief The scene in the Russian capsule where Dr Ryan seemingly had accepted her inevitable fate I won t say any more just go see this film This movie received universal acclaim from the professional critics but has been savaged by quite a few amateur movie critics who criticize the movie for two main reasons First the storyline is assailed as being mediocre or pedestrian and others rail against the scientific accuracy of what is portrayed in the film To this I say codswallop Many forget the purpose of movies i e to entertain the audience and this one does this in spades Just go see it you will not be sorry Five Stars out of Five,10
25 February 2014,Almost Perfect Movie,Gravity is an almost perfect film One of the reasons for this near perfection is it seems so simple yet a lot of work went into making this film seem so simple Bullock s performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done Bullock s portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging As she is swinging and rotating through space she manages to make us believe in her character s dire situation Again it is remarkable how moving her character is when she has so little time to create one Alfonso Cuaron is a gifted filmmaker He isn t the most prolific director working today but he spends a lot of time crafting shaping and making films that are interesting and unique Gravity is his best film yet and one of the best films of the year,10

19 October 2013,Visually Brilliant & Emotionally Thrilling,The film was just amazing I went in with high expectations came out of the hall feeling very fulfilled It s a great visual treat blended with deep emotional substance for the audience It s one of those films that isn t only so technically sensational but connects with you intrinsically as well And I really loved how the director paid homage to some of the classic space films along with a sweet reference to my most favorite animated film Wall E with that whole fire extinguisher scene You have to watch it in IMAX 3D to receive the full ecstatic experience Best film of 2013,9
10 March 2014,"In the film ""Gravity,"" oxygen wasn't the only thing in short supply.",In the film Gravity oxygen wasn t the only thing in short supply Acting skill personality rational physics and a sensible plot were sorely lacking To nominate Sandra Bullock for Best Actress is to slap the face of every actress To give the director an Oscar derides the Hollywood establishment as a whole Take a long look at the last shots in the film then scratch your head and say the words Best Director The only thing that stood out in this film were special technical effects They make the film worth watching but don t expect the plot to be as sophisticated as the effects Consider the plot to be on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon,2

30 December 2013,Amazing...,For some time now Hollywood has no more ideas Common knowledge Once in a while I try a movie hoping the dry well has some water in it Ratings on IMDb are governed by the studios I hope wholeheartedly because the horror of the ratings being the work of us aaaargh movies that should make a let s say 3 and wouldn t have been released years ago are now rated 8 Makes you wonder No not really I didn t know anything about Gravity before I went to watch it Only the rating and well you never know right Wrong you do know The movie has a painfully thin storyline and has gruesome acting Trying to get deeper into the point the maker is trying to make is blocked by the inferior level of it all I gave it a 1 only because a 0 isn t possible The movie s cost was 100 milj maybe pay the writer some extra next time and cast an unknown actress for the leading part This movie would ve benefited from it A movie to be forgotten about in a very short time Only remembered for the warning it gives you don t fall for it but I m sure I will because you never know Right,1
3 October 2013,"Something Visually Beautifully, Something Tense, Yet Something Void",I thought Gravity did a great job with the special effects and the realism of space and the cinematography I thought in my opinion that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were great in their roles The film provides plenty of moments of visual awe and deep tension So overall I thought the film was pretty decent The movie is a visually entertaining and fun for audiences who are looking for spectacular effects and truly real visuals What made me slightly dislike the film itself was the fact that the background to the characters wasn t explained thoroughly OK Ryan Stone s Sandra Bullock daughter dies but I never really felt the pain that she felt since we never got to visually see memories or her back on Earth with her daughter Also what kind of person was Matt Kowalski George Clooney s character He seemed more like a guy straight out of some hick town bar who had fond memories back at home The plot wasn t fully fleshed out and the 90 minute span of this film was just flat out BOGUS This film could of EASILY been 30 minutes longer Giving the time for the characters to be fully fleshed out what the true purpose of their mission was and what they truly experienced besides some bloodshed tears a little drama and a safe landing home for Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock Overall this film was good but not fantastic by ANY stretch of the imagination Do I find this film overrated Hell yes Do I think its a bad film by any means NO Its a movie simply built on eye candy visuals and tension Yet it had little plot and poorly fleshed out characters as well as the point of the entire mission Gravity was OK but its only worth a one time view,6

28 January 2014,I couldn't see anything unconventional in this film except a few beautiful shots,I saw the movie in IMAX 3D despite the fact that I am not a fan of it and the experience itself was effective yes but the film was not The film was visually beautiful but not that dazzling except two scenes the beginning and the octopussy like cords scene Honestly as said despite I found the movie visually beautiful it was not a jaw dropping visual feast in contrast with the hype For example The Tree of Life was much better visually or Holy Motors In terms of space experience I prefer Into The Darkness as a recent sci fi film it was not perfect but near perfect as a sci fi blockbuster and 2001 from the past the mother of all sci fi movies Children of Men is a masterpiece for me and it was a brilliant film from a genius director but I couldn t see or feel that in Gravity The idea is brilliant but the movie is not unconventional to carry this idea This is not an offbeat film there are just a few different angles and shots the editing in some scenes is impressive but all these are technical aspects of the film so is this enough What about the story what about the decisions some silly decisions of the characters what about their motivation or what about their weird reactions just to affect or manipulate the audience I am a Clooney fan also I really like Mrs Bullock when I was a kid I fell in love with her when I watched The Demolition Man so seeing these people in the movie was a joy for me but after a while the movie turned into a conventional space drama thriller like Apollo 13 or even Red Planet by the way Apollo 13 is a great film but wasn t this movie supposed to be an offbeat space film or at least an original film Just the idea is original here not the execution or the story especially the development and the conclusion part of the story are pretty typical The atmosphere could have been more uncanny the situations could have been more suspenseful the story could have been darker and the story could have been more mysterious The spiritual background of the film was not that deep just a few obvious symbols and themes that s all The movie was rather far fetched than being subtle in transferring emotions and ideas also it was rather mechanic than a thrill ride This is not a psychological film because there is no time for that the film was too short maybe and I didn t find the film inspiring including the finale Gravity is not the new A Space Odyssey,

17 October 2021,"Who need logic, when PLOT is your armor?",Annoying Sandra Bullock ignorance and mindless but hot headed and emotional then panicking tantrum etc She used to be and known It might be cute and adorable for her some 20 YEARS AGO Carying on that little girl in PMS character today for her heck even on earth is tiresome let alone in outer space In fact It s hard to think such an emotionally unstable outer space worker would even exists Everything almost she did was dumb and stupid as a normal people considered much less as an astronout yet THE PLOT ARMOR made her miraculously magically divinely effortlessly walk on passing every impossible death threats crisis merely by lucky chances OVER and OVER again 15 minutes into the movie you d already got tired and bored But I have to endure the agonizing PLOT stupidity until the end of the movie to give a proper measurement on the review don t I Well at least the graphics view and CGI was good Overall score 4 5 10,1
24 October 2013,Pure Cinema,Fledgling astronaut Dr Ryan Stone Bullock ventures to the stars to upgrade the Hubble Telescope she is accompanied by an experienced team of astronauts including veteran space jockey Matt Kowalski Clooney Suddenly a freak accident leads to Earth s entire orbit being littered with deadly debris As events unfold an otherwise everyday mission becomes something quite out of the ordinary a desperate journey of survival across the vacuum of space From the opening moment of Gravity it becomes abundantly clear that it is an exceptional film There will be an awful lot said about the technical brilliance of the sound effects and cinematography of this film because all are quite unfathomable and enthralling Camera movements are artfully seamless graceful and sweeping the viewer is effortlessly transported between the third person view where weightless objects career towards them seconds later only to find themselves in the first person seeing though Ryan s panicking eyes her hyperventilating breath clouding her visor The technical wonder involved here is not what makes Gravity a truly great film however it is simply a tool that allows the viewer to very quickly and effectively build empathy with the characters and their plight Ryan and Matt are likable characters they are very human genuine and flawed They are believable to the extent that any technical mastery involved takes a back seat to the narrative and characterisation For this is a film with a lot of heart and soul the themes are big metaphysical and distinctly attached to the concept of what it means to be human Gravity is a film made for cinema and 3D and this is the way it should be seen if you wish to see it at it s best for no reason more complicated than because it is quite simply beautiful Because of the themes involved here Gravity will probably not be suitable for younger children Anybody else though is sure to take something positive from the experience of watching it and I suggest that you all do just that at your earliest convenience,10
25 November 2013,One of the Best Movies of the Year!,In a society where the success of media is determined by how much money is gotten from the overuse of 3D it can be very refreshing to find a movie that has 3D but does not let it take over This is probably one of the greatest strengths of Gravity Gravity takes place in you guessed it space and it surrounds the experiences of two astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney When disaster strikes they find themselves stranded in the middle of space and must find a way back to Earth Sounds like a simple idea but that is the genius of it There is nothing complicated about the story doesn t try adding some deep message about politics society or anything like that No the message is skillfully present in the movie without feeling forced because the filmmakers let the story play out I am sure there was a great temptation to make the moral of the story as obvious as the sun in the middle of the day but they didn t That alone is worthy of praise Another thing worthy of praise must go straight to Alfonso Cuaron He is without a doubt one of the best directors of our time He masterfully created a film with spellbinding beauty mixed with awe inspiring terror All the while he didn t lose focus of what this story is really about the will of the human spirit Yet much of the credit must go to the leading actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock Both did fantastic jobs but it is Bullock who should get most of the praise This was definitely her best performance to date She portrayed the vulnerability strength and pure terror of a woman trapped in a situation where hope is gone Such a role demands an actress in the highest of standards and Bullock proved she was deserving of the role At this point she is a deadlock for the nomination for best leading actress and I will not be surprised if she wins She was absolutely phenomenal Yet there is one aspect that this film is almost guaranteed to win at the Oscars special effects Watching this movie made me feel like I was truly in space and experiencing every feeling these characters were feeling Rarely have I ever been absolutely star struck by just the visuals of a film The last time I felt this immersed in a film was when Avatar came out but I didn t see that in 3D I am one who views 3D as nothing but a gimmick However when I saw Gravity in 3D I knew there was still hope for it This was one of those rare times where 3D added to the experience of seeing a movie and not detract from it Absolutely gorgeous movie on every scale So in the end Gravity takes a simple idea and shows how sometimes the simplest idea is the better way to go This was all thanks to masterful direction fantastic acting beautiful visuals and wonderful writing A great testament to the will of the human spirit I will not be surprised if it wins Best Picture,10
17 November 2013,Film making at it's very best.,It s been a long time since I ve seen a film which raised the bar like this one This isn t just a excellent film it s a lesson to other film makers Alfonso Cuar n the director has an amazing ability to draw the viewer in to the film whole The long tracking shots hold you I was impressed with one of his previous film Children of Men and Gravity raises this standard even further I can not speak higher of how brilliantly the direction of this film was executed The best advice I can give to anybody interested in watching Gravity is don t look at any stills from the film Don t watch or read any reviews Try and see the film as fresh as you can Let Alfonso guide you through be seduced by his wonderful work And you ll leave the cinema in awe of Gravity Gravity is without doubt one of the best if not the best films I ve ever watched,10
29 June 2018,A White-Knuckled Meditation on Life,Pure gold Each time I watch this film I am surprised at the amount of suspended intensity It feels like I m holding my breath for 50 of the run time And the other half is split between the most gorgeous depictions of space you ve ever seen required HD viewing and a deeply personal meditation on what it means to be alive the ability and privilege to pray to walk and to keep going despite how tough it gets both physically and emotionally all innately bestowed upon each person from the womb There is so much to praise here from experiencing the weightlessness of space by Emmanuel Lubezki s floating unbroken takes to the beautiful metaphor of birth One of the biggest regrets of my life is not watching this in theaters It may rely heavily on CG and it may not have an intricately developed plot but I firmly believe that this is one of the greatest films,10
2 April 2015,Google Earth is better...,So you would like to watch the earth from the space Sure I d say you d rather spend some time in Google Earth rather than floating here around with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Like too often don t be fooled by the actor s reputation In this film they must have been bored as well There is almost no action and if then you can already guess what happens next You could think that the only reason of this film was to show the latest technology for space filming This very film is not only unrealistic it s also boring impossible and a pure time loss Fortunately I could borrow the film from someone else and didn t pay anything for it You are warned,1
30 November 2013,the infinity of the womb,I ve been absent Not only from writing about films but from watching them with the frequency of past days as well Part of it was life driven as i don t have the time i used to have Part of it is because from time to time i feel the need to step a little back from whatever i m doing more intensely and reevaluate things Passions are better enhanced through fasting I ve had 6 or 7 very intense years where my life mixed a great deal with the lives of the films i ve watched That s the beauty of films when you approach the films that change you by allowing then to become a part of your life by blending them into you as if you had a choice Cuar n had changed me before he s so intense because his narrative is always in the eye His films are bits intimacies that arise from the magic of the relation between character space and camera That s the basis of his dramatic construction that s where the story lies That s what allows him to spin and make beautiful free yet coordinated movements like a planet circling the sun Children of men changed me because of that When i heard that Cuar n decided to go to space and enhance even more that special relation between space and camera i knew he was going for something even bigger He changes me now once again Nothing is more powerful and as such more difficult to bend as space It s infinite in its possibilities like desert it is totally spatial and it is the opposite of architecture which is also all about space Children of men mastered the built space as this one masters the infinite Intimacy of a space capsule as opposed to the possibilities of gravity zero The camera as the ultimate non animated disembodied character as chaotic as space itself yet as emotional as any of the 2 characters in the film Cuar n ranks at the highest point together with Kalatozov in that so dear to me theme of space manipulation and film Both actors do what was expected Clooney plays Clooney s character and becomes a useful wheel in the mechanism allowing with his persona to make the audiences enter easily this otherwise strange unexplored film frame Sandra tries hard as she always does perhaps harder than she should and also as always she seats uneasily in the role but again that works in favor of the narrative as her character also does not belong to the world where she moves Than comes the magic And world from the moment it starts to shake is always a sequence of total stillness followed by spatial chaos Meteo rain vs the silence inside a capsule breaking cranes again the cranes are flying vs the sight of Earth framed by a window We get the most powerful womb representation that i can think of in my whole life in films and the metaphor of poles of touching extremes is complete as the intimacy of the uterus kisses the intimacy of the infinite where Clooney is allowed to sing while he sees the sunset or rise This is the second film in 2 years that really changed me was compared by a great deal of people to 2001 which i find has nothing to do with it Is it the fact that he films planets and black space That the actors are dressed as astronauts That we have scenes in zero gravity The other film was Malick s Tree of Life This is the best 3D i ve seen Nowhere else have i seen such a meaningful use of the possibilities My opinion 5 5,
11 October 2013,I USED TO Dream of Space Travel...,When I was a little girl I strongly remember wanting to grow up to be an astronaut I know who hasn t right I have been an avid watcher of as many space travel and sci fi movies and TV series as I can and I ve even studied a few astrophysics and astronomy books attempted to go to college I always and even up until recently seriously dreamed of traveling to space myself Before it was simply reality and chronic lifelong illnesses and disability since childhood that had kept me from it But that changed when I saw Gravity Upon experiencing the most immersive film I have ever been to feeling like I also was trapped in space with my palms sweating toes curling heart pounding at the speed of light and having many breathless moments it was like being on an hour long roller coaster ride through space The best 3D effects I have ever seen and I am urging EVERYONE I speak to that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie anything short of a 3D cinema experience will diminish it too greatly to excuse You MUST go see this movie in the theater Trying to watch it at home will ROB YOU OF THE BEST THRILL RIDE OF YOUR LIFE Upon seeing the terrors experiencing them myself through this movie I no longer wish to travel to space I feel just fine with my feet planted firmly on the ground than you At the very least I thought of NOTHING ELSE while sitting in the theater and it will help you forget the insanities of our world for a short time If I could give it 100 stars it would be a no brainer Forget those who chose to nit pick this cosmic marvel of an experience If you go to this movie and can think only of the scientific inaccuracies you should be cast in the TV series Big Bang Theory as Sheldon s long lost Father,10
13 October 2013,"Houston, Gravity Doesn't Just Wow The Eyes, It Stirs the SOUL, DO YOU COPY ??",Never knew the Earth looks so damn beautiful from outside A Perfect 10 on 10 Visual Experience created by Alfonso Cuaron with exceptional performances of Sandra Bullock George Clooney this movie was really a Gem The cinematography was so brilliantly done that it never felt that it was not actually shot in outer space t has been hailed by the critics as a rare example of intelligent science fiction film making The scenes of space are in equal measure breathtakingly beautiful and relentlessly haunting The silence and the stillness leap off the screen and into the very atmosphere of the theater from the word go and it becomes immediately clear that Gravity is meant to be experienced not just watched Gravity is not a film to watch on your phone on the bus You need to sit as close as you can to the biggest screen you can find maybe a gargantuan IMAX screen You need to put on those 3 D glasses and rock out,10
10 October 2013,NEW AGE FOR Hollywood!!!,I wanted to write a review about a film in which I would talk about how Hollywood went a long make that a huge way since Lumiere brothers and late 19th century when that train entered that station This is that film The new age has been ushered and we are going to see many more brilliant films in the future that I am sure What a business and that is not just a remark there is no business like show business Bilions of people are thronging into movie theaters throughout the world eager to see a film with someone dear to them And do not forget the popcorn and cola It truly is a people s art just as that Russian philosopher said This film I dedicate to Hollywood and its success As far as plot goes well never mind Sandra pushes few buttons and saves herself Clooney could of sipped few more sips of vodka while he was at it We came back crushing back to Earth all those billions of dollars NASA spent came down for Sandra to win the Oscar She deserves that so much The boy sitting next to me in the movie theater said Mommy I like when she pushes the buttons I was thinking to myself I could push few buttons on Sandra hope she would not mind So Sandra when you lift that Oscar think of your little fan since the time of Speed You are such a nice person Real darling Actors usually are and you are a star among them shining Just like the stars in space The end was remarkable we came back to Earth since we can not conquer the space and we are going to fight to walk the Earth freely All six billion of us,8
14 October 2013,Nearest space experience 99.998% of us will experience!,This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space The opening shot is 13 min long and not once you think that they are doing it too long There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuar n s space thriller Gravity possesses and manages to sustain through out the run time The whole movie is shot in just one room plus some world class CGI Which is breathtakingly amazing The detail to ISS HST and the earth view is top notch But Its not just the graphics that keep the movie together Its Sandy bullock s performance too Though George Clooney s role is kinda short but still I enjoyed every minute of it Bullock takes this science fiction thriller and turns it into a very human story A conflict between the fight to survive and the fight to go on living Throughout the film it is clear that Stone is distant almost detached from the other characters She seems almost indifferent at times to the horror that surrounds her It becomes clear that she had never come to terms with life after the death of her young daughter The audience need only look into her eyes to see the cold indifference behind the fear It is an emotion that is all the stronger when one is in space and able to see just how inconsequential they are to the grand scale of the world and the universe The audience along with Stone is left to wonder does it really matter If you die the world will continue to spin as if nothing ever happened The cinematographer is dazzling I felt as though the cuts were non existent I was never aware of an edit almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story But as I said before Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story It is an experience The movie is not entirely dependent on CGI and Sandy B But writing is also its strong part So is the background score Sometimes the way it transits from the heavy heartbeats to silence Just perfect The dialogs are very good too There are times when you think you can predict the story but I bet you cant I would recommend this movie for everyone Even if it s a 10 yr old I am sure they too will enjoy mind blowing effects Gravity is a sure shot Oscar winner for Best film Best actress Best background score and Best director I really really hope that Clooney too gets something for his supporting role Maybe for best editing too A hard 10 on 10,10
9 October 2013,And the Oscar for best cinematography and visual effects goes to...........,This picture ranks in the top 5 of all movies known for visual effects and cinematography If this film does not get the Academy award for those two categories on March 2nd 2014 there is a screw loose The story is truly stunning It is simply about the human condition of overcoming incredible odds of survival using faith spirit intelligence and true grit I felt like I was inside a spacesuit with absolutely no control over the situation and losing my oxygen My only beef with this film are the circumstances that caused the debris field in the first place Those damn Russians,9
2 April 2019,Where are the Aliens?,Seriously the whole movie I was expecting mysterious other worldly encounter but it never came based off the trailers My mom fell asleep so she got the most out of this movie haha This had to be the biggest joke in Cinema history I don t understand how this guy goes from children of men to this IMDB needs to start stepping up the fake reviews it s sickening seeing this trash and every super hero trashcan movies rated as some of the greatest movies of all time It s literally space simulator might as well put on a NASA training documentary,1
12 July 2022,I really tried to enjoy this film,I love sci fi and really wanted to see a good sci fi film But THIS IS NOT IT The science and physics they try to convince people of is absurd I can usually suspend disbelief when the film is clearly fantasy but when they try to be scientific about it and fail miserably I just want to puke First there is way the training would only last 6 months Second there wouldn t be someone as incompetent as the person Sandra Bullock plays From one laughable scene to another the film descends into absurdity pretty fast If you don t care about any semblance of reality in a film that wants so hard to be believable then this is fine Otherwise don t waste your time,5
7 September 2021,The story is very weak.,Was there even a story something the draw in the viewer Nope,2
16 November 2015,Absolutely awful,You only need half a brain cell to know that this movie is absolutely terrible in every single way I do not care how many awards Gravity won it s still a pathetic movie The acting wasn t even that great The producers and director probably just threw in a bunch of famous actors and a whole bunch of unrealistic special effects to make it seem that this movie seems good I was bored out of my skull throughout the movie I do appreciate movies with little to no action as well as action packed movies This is a massive slap in the face of everyone who ever made a genuinely good movie I have no hope for anyone that claims Gravity is any good I cannot begin to highlight all the errors involved in this film without giving too many spoilers I highly recommend you don t watch this,1
4 December 2013,Not worth the time to watch,15 minutes of Bullock screaming Oy Vey in space followed by a Clooney suicide got me to shut it off All hype and a sign that J Cameron has passed his prime The initial scene was promising It was a good plot line The movie was devastatingly disappointing after that While I did not see it in 3 D the promised cgi graphics were there at the beginning Other than the view of earth the rest could have been shot in a closet Writing a review on a movie I walked out on is a cheap shot Paying to see it would be a rip off This is just warning to anyone thinking about a theater to watch it in Wait for it to come on cable so you can change the channel,3

1 April 2014,Imax - Space Fatalism,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,4
17 October 2013,Not a movie... but an experience,The plot of the movie is Space That itself is a challenging part for the movie which is depicted in a brilliant way by the Director Alfonso Cuar n The Emptiness and loneliness of space is well presented in the movie The breathtaking visuals and very deep scores is really outstanding and go well blended with the movie Technical study done to take this movie is impressive It shows the dedication put in the details of the film A pure thriller for almost every audience Widely based on a proposed theory called Kessler syndrome look for this after you watch the movie which deals with satellite chain reaction in space Well selected casting Impressive acting by Sandra Bullock George Clooney performed his best in the given character sketch The fear and expressions are well presented Every single shot has a psychological impact in many different aspects A must watch in my opinion for Sci Fi lovers space enthusiasts Thriller etc,10
3 March 2014,Grossly overrated,Bullock plays herself in space as some computer tech repairing some satellite on a space shuttle Mission commander is Clooney playing himself as well They get a notice from mission command on earth that a satellite has blown up sending debris their way and that all satellites are being hit and eventually they ll lose communication Clooney orders Bullock to finish up but she thinks she knows better and keeps tinkering with a computer board And indeed they end up hit with debris Bullock ends up tumbling out of control detached from the arm that was holding her to the shuttle As she goes flying out of control she loses communication with everyone When all hope seems lost Clooney appears and grabs her With his jet pack they go back to the shuttle and discover it s destroyed and some other guy part of the mission is dead They make their way to the nearby international space station that has a released parachute with hundreds of belts entangled Clooney realizes that for them to make it he will have to let go Bullock arrives at the station but there s a fire in one of the sections which quickly expands everywhere else She escapes in a pod to the nearby Chinese space station There she has one more chance to escape in a pod to earth But as earlier as well oxygen becomes an issue plus she isn t exactly at flying these craft Gravity is a pretty looking movie And how could it be otherwise These days the least you can do with a space movie is show cool sights A bit of annoyance is the constantly rotating and floating camera The story itself is surprisingly simple and empty Our main character finds herself in an emergency and everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some The writers aren t a bit shy about exaggerating things and or forgetting about realism when it suits them Twice in the movie oxygen becomes a problem but it s also quickly forgotten when it s not convenient to the filmmakers Performances are very weak You can accept Bullock in a many roles an astronaut computer expert isn t one of them Same with Clooney At the same time Bullock and Clooney for that matter is likable enough that you can watch her scream and groan through this movie Gravity looks good and Bullock makes a rather slim story watchable But Gravity is a neither a great nor good movie and certainly not an worthy award winner,4
13 October 2013,Not even close to the best space movie ever!!,Just because a movie looks great does not mean it is the best space movie ever You get trapped about mid movie with ridiculous dialogue spoken through the collagen lips of Sandra Bullock with her trademark annoyingness There was no drama that had me on the edge of my seat The dialogue made me cringe from embarrassment for the writers A gratuitous back story and unbelievable ways for Bullock to get out of situations by figuring out how to read Chinese and Russian etc etc I really expected her to have a shark try to try to eat her at some point in the movie only to be foiled by the voice of her deceased daughter in her head telling her how to fight off a shark This was unwatchable and unbearable at times It will go towards the bottom of my space movie list,2
13 October 2013,An Oscar contender in more than one category!,I wasn t too sure about seeing this film after all it looked kind of one dimensional for a sci fi flick Boy was I wrong The special effects are dazzling and awe inspiring and fabulous but this is not just a special effects feast for the eyes there is one heck of a good story here You actually believe you are in space The writing is phenomenal the acting Oscar worthy Sandra Bullock was amazing and the musical score was the perfect foil for the storyline Even George Clooney was exceptional This was a story of survival plain and simple but done with such mastery that it draws you in and you are there with Ryan Stone throughout the whole movie You are invested in her fight It was a simple story told by a master director Hats off to Cueron and son GO SEE THIS FILM,9
7 March 2014,Intense,Well its a one take movie done pretty well 1917 in space or rather 1917 is Gravity in ww1 Regardless pretty enjoyable,8
7 October 2013,The sub-orbital Titanic movie,Confusion comes from sudden questioning how come NASA did hire a guy such as George Clooney This guy seems more prone to do some Thursday evening bar chatting than concentrate on the real astronauts work The answer Take the International Space Station visuals and stick them to a Hollywood script People don t realize that without the filming in the space environment this movie script is as complex as the recipe of a donut Some time ago I was asking my gf why did she like so much horror movies She said it s because it s giving her emotions Just for the sake of emotions Well this one is giving anxiety emotions and dizziness as a bonus What is giving me even more dizziness is how high this movie is rated here on IMDb along with so many other well achieved cinematographic productions They also could have called it the long and exhausting labor of Sandra Bullock supported by a disturbingly zen Dr Clooney Oh and I never knew about Sandra s spare time hobbies this girl LIKES to crash space stations Thumbs up girl Oh and it s all CGI It seems the actor s faces and voices are real To be verified This film is all technical Yes there is some sort of emotion at the ending I understand it well but after all this mess of a space ship wrecking chase it just doesn t pass any more Save your money go see a different movie and sneak into the Gravity projecting room in the last three minutes of the movie That s all you need to see,4

25 November 2013,Truly amazing,Believe the hype this is an amazing film It truly is You may have seen survival films before but not like this Go see it now Unlike many films set in space this focuses on realism You ll find no aliens in this film no laser guns and no space battles Instead this shows us a snap shot of how astronauts working in space notably the difficulty in operating in a completely hostile environment Many people will watch this film and love this visuals especially if seen in 3D Whilst I agree it looks great in 3D seeing this in 2D would still be impressive But even if the visuals weren t impressive this would still be a very memorable film I was mostly impressed with how space is presented not as a beautiful magical area with endless wonder exploration and potential for adventure like sailing the seven seas But instead space is shown to be an environment where the slightest thing changing or going wrong results in death or the threat of death Even with high degrees of safety and training we cannot control this environment And the physics which applies to space I ve had a concept of but never seen just how different it is to Earth is shown to be a danger itself WOW Onto the characters There is only two of them And both do a great job with George Clooney easily portraying the calm experienced astronaut Sandra Bullock portraying the technical proficient and capable yet flawed and inexperienced astronaut Well done to both of them for giving a very memorable performance Lastly I want to praise the running time of the film Too often I see movies which run long because it is seen as best practice The result is a drawn out story which can loose audience interest and therefore fail to entertain us At 91 minutes long it absolutely captives you from start to finish I would rather see a very concisely told story that is only 1 5 hours long than sit through a so called 3 hour epic which is uninteresting unnecessarily long and not entertaining in segments e g The Hobbit Go see the film of 2013 today,10
12 October 2013,If you liked Apollo 13 then this is the film for you,Gravity is compelling mesmerizing and at times terrifying This unusual film tells the story of two astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clonney who are adrift in space after a dreadful space accident But don t be fooled this is no simple floating in space story The film is a wild ride of superb effects a high class script and stand out acting particularly by Bullock who would surely count this as one of the most challenging roles of her career It has shades of Apollo 13 but without much of the technical detail Some parts do appear to be slightly unbelievable but the ideas about the initial accident are based on real scientific theory People will tell you that you have to see it in 3d but I accidentally booked a 2d session and it was still fabulous My only tip don t bring any popcorn because it will still be sitting on your lap untouched and cold as the credit rolls in,10
7 January 2014,"Just plain bad! Awful, dumb, stupid",I find unbelievable that so many people give this movie a 10 I m in absolute awe all the insane bla bla about the cinematography the story line etc hard to believe we saw the same movie This movie is sooooo unrealistic it hurts effect were equally bad and those cheesy all American lines pfff Sandra Bullock is a good actress though she makes some terrible choices especially the comedy s Really was hoping for some of her former glory with all the nominations After reading some of the reviews i got excited thought i was going to be a great space movie I really don t get what other people see in this Don t waste your time if you have any intelligence,1
22 August 2020,Ludicrously dramatic,Good film and effects but not realistic Too many flaws for real life scenarios but I guess you could view this as a what if movie,4
4 October 2013,The New 2001: A Space Odessey?,Few cinematic experiences are quite as immersive or as complete as Gravity the tightly developed and much hyped space drama by writer director Alfonso Cuar n and the director s first movie since 2006 s highly acclaimed Children of Men With Gravity Cuar n gives audiences a vastly different experience than he has before one so unique in its presentation that it s curious any studio would finance it to the tune of 80 million and give it a wide release Warner Bros took that chance and early buzz indicates it might pay off And yet there s something familiar about Gravity especially within the science fiction genre Anyone who has enjoyed a small cast science fiction film say the Sam Rockwell vehicle Moon or the horror classic Alien will similarly like Gravity which epitomizes the sub genre It follows a medical engineer on her first mission to low Earth orbit Sandra Bullock and a nearly retired veteran astronaut George Clooney as they struggle to survive floating untethered in space after a barrage of debris violently destroys their spacecraft A title card in the film s opening frames sets the stakes Life in space is impossible Except for a few transmissions with mission control voiced by Ed Harris and some quick jarring shots Bullock and Clooney comprise the film s full cast It s just the two of them in stark contrast with the infinite and hostile vastness of space low on oxygen and fuel struggling to make it to safety Turns out there isn t a lot of that in space The film begins with a single extended shot that lasts so I ve read I didn t time it some 17 minutes Cuar n is a master at the extended shot the one take war shot near the end of Children of Men was one of the last decade s best scenes and Gravity is full of them but the beginning is striking It starts quietly serenely with gorgeous shots of Earth and space as Cuar n plays with the lack of stable perspective inherent in zero G but once the action starts it doesn t stop There are plenty of nerve wracking moments and a number of shocks and surprises with some of the tensest moments saved for the final scenes But to say much more would diminish the fun of this movie Gravity is a technical masterpiece on all fronts an all out sensory blitz with deft cleverly utilized sound editing and production My favorite touch was at a moment when Bullock hits her head hard followed by several stressful seconds of ringing And the attention to detail is mesmerizing with Cuar n making only a few minor physics missteps mostly necessary even intentional in order to advance the plot Clocking in at just 90 minutes the film doesn t spend a lot of time ruminating on philosophy which is perhaps a missed opportunity But it feels tight Every scene every frame is necessary to tell the story and every aspect of the film s production works in concert to create one of the most engrossing films audiences are likely to see But it s the film s astonishing visuals that make it so thoroughly captivating thanks to some amazing special effects and the camera work of frequent Cuar n and Terrence Malick collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki Astronauts who have caught early screenings have said that Gravity is the closest they have felt to being in orbit without leaving Earth If you lean back and let yourself get lost in the cinematography you ll feel the same I ve never felt so immersed in a film as I did watching Gravity This is definitely a movie to catch in 3D It s still early in awards season but I wouldn t be surprised to learn that Bullock Clooney and Cuar n were expanding their award shelves in anticipation On many fronts Gravity is probably the year s best movie to date and if you don t pick too many nits about orbital physics you will likely agree Just get lost in the experience and be sure to unclench your fists when the credits start rolling,10
6 October 2013,"""Half of North America lost their Facebook""",The great Amazing visuals visually stunning amazing direction the type of movie 3D was made for well acted overall The good Short and sweet does not overstay its welcome The bad Very bad dialogue for this type of film especially from George Clooney s character And seriously what Nasa astronaut would say to themselves I hate space or sunny with a chance of satellite debris The badder A lot of Hollywood clich exposition aimed directly at the audience terrible stereotypes subtlety interwoven Chinese play ping pong and have Budha statues Russians drink vodka yeah yeah yeah The worst The over hype of this film an actual line of script mentioning the similarly over hyped Facebook It is a sin to use trendy flavor of the week pop culture lingo in films especially in one this good Come on now do you really think people will remember facebook in 20 years while watching this film I think when that line comes up in 20 years the kids will kids say what the hell is facebook Visuals Timeless Dialogue Not so much It s like mentioning social networking site Friendster a decade ago a NO NO And the character development was a bit weak and wasted time with some meaningless quips that never paid off This would have been just as good a movie as a silent film Overall a solid flick but not anything I could imagine watching in its entirety a second time 6 10,6

7 October 2013,This movie is lucky it's beautiful. VERY LUCKY.,I saw this movie in 3d and that was it s greatest strength It is absolutely beautiful and some of the best 3d i ve ever seen Visually it is a masterpiece Now that I ve said my kind words I ll point out why this movie really let me down The Premise of this movie is not good for a feature movie Someone trapped in space trying to get back to Earth would be good for a 30 minute TV episode but in a 90 minute movie like this I felt bored because I knew no matter how she gets inside the ship she can t have any good luck for another 45 minutes because the movie has 50 minutes left Now onto my big problem Sandra Bullock I like her I think she does a good straight woman in comedies and she surprised me by doing well here Her acting was very good The problem was the character A brief 20 second reveal that she had a kid is supposed to connect me to her and that is ALL WE GET in her character It just doesn t make me care if she survives Also having her alone makes it so that if you don t particularly like her character tough luck that it all you have Also they kill off George Clooney I LOVE George Clooney I think he is a fun light funny confident presence in any movie lucky enough to have him He s no different in this movie And when they kill him all we are left with is a sad sack uninteresting complaining character acted by someone who deserves better The movie could have been and should have been Clooney s character fighting for survival The personality he brought to the character would have made the slow parts better And god were there slow parts All in all I feel like i pay 14 dollars to see Sandra Bullock spin circles in the vacuum of space and complain for 90 minutes Have you ever met someone and thought Geez you re luck your re beautiful because when you open you mouth I want to jump off a cliff I met that in movie form They named it Gravity,1

13 September 2013,"Good, but not great",Let me start by disclaiming spoiler free I assume you have seen a preview or read at least enough to know the most basic premise of the film If you truly have no idea what it s about well I make references to content used in the trailers But seriously if this does describe you why are you on IMDb and reading a review at all The Good Beautiful amazing breathtakingly phenomenal cinematography I honestly feel closer to having an idea of what being in space might be like as a result of the way this was shot Solid acting I felt the characters were genuine and Clooney Bullock fit their roles quite well in fact I m surprised at any negativity toward the acting Suspenseful Cuaron did a great job keeping the audience on the edge of their seat and had a solid balance between slowly built drawn out sequences and other gotcha kind of moments Dialogue and characters Great blends of comic and serious deep and light etc moments Very well put together from that end The Bad Repetitive events You know that scene in the preview where someone is grabbing on to some space ship part for dear life and it appears that if they miss it they will be lost in space forever Yeah I ve now seen that moment a few dozen times to the point where I d predict a Gravity Drinking Game around it It s just too much and while I get it that that s a big part of the premise it becomes nearly comical after the first few times it occurs Too many crises If you ve read the trivia around Apollo 13 you ve probably noticed they deliberately removed some of the events that transpired in real life from the film mostly because they didn t think the audience would find it believable In Gravity I felt that the cascading series of mishaps were just too many from start to finish I think numerous moments could ve been reduced or removed completely and the end result would ve been more gripping Instead I kept getting that feeling where my suspension of disbelief was being taxed Too many last possible moment sequences To avoid spoiling anything just imagine a caper movie where the bomb is set to go off and after a ton of action the bomb is defused with less than a second to go Now do it 3 or more I ve lost count times in the same movie It certainly builds up tension but also increased the okay now they are just messing with me effect The trailer While I d say it s a tossup between Drive and Hancock as to worst expectation setting for a movie EVER I d say Gravity s trailer is on thin ice If you ve paid too much attention to it it s pretty ridden with spoilers thankfully I had not seen it more than once before going into the movie But if you also just saw it once or twice you d probably be thinking it s a non stop space action flick It isn t and if you are unfamiliar with the director s other works you should definitely pay them some attention first The movie paces really well actually but it s a much more drawn out film than I think a lot of people will expect Annoying 3D I wish I d seen the IMAX 3D version maybe that would change my feelings here As it is I didn t and other than 2 3 really cool uses of 3D it was pretty superfluous to the movie Overall I have negative feeling about it Per the above it was wonderfully put together but ultimately I felt the movie spent more time trying to manipulate me with unnecessary tension I think the basic premise was suspenseful and dramatic enough but had several too many and now we ll find a way for another crazy bad thing to happen moments for me I wish that weren t the case as I really did want to like it Assuming you ll ignore this my only advice is to definitely see it in the theaters in IMAX if you can,6

10 October 2013,A beautiful view of absolute terror.,I couldn t imagine what it must feel like to be lost in space but after watching this film I have a much better understanding of the sheer terror of possibly taking your last breath while the rest of the human race enjoy the planet that is floating in front of you There is no place like home Amazing sounds visuals and anyone with an imagination will be watching this on the edge of their seat fueled with wonderment and emotion 3 D is usually so so but in this movie the 3 D gimmick shines in all it s glory and actually enhances every second of this amazing movie It gets a 10 simply because of the ending it makes you think about how amazingly special we are to be capable of being here,10
3 April 2018,Gravity Provided a Grave Situation,Gravity is a lot like Open Water Castaway and other tragedy movies in which a person is stranded in a dire situation I d say the monumental difference is that in the other movies the people were at least on Earth I can t even imagine being stranded in space limited oxygen no water no food infinite darkness that s stuff of night terrors But that was the situation Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock was in and her reaction was not unlike most anyone s would be abject fear This movie was intense throughout and if you can put yourself into that situation it makes for very heart racing event What I thought was most amazing about the movie was how they were able to create a frightening and desperate scenario with little to no noise They set it up at the beginning by stating that sound doesn t travel in space so when catastrophe struck it was visual only It was quite awesome,8
1 January 2014,A compelling tale of survival,GRAVITY is the story of Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock an inexperienced astronaut who is carrying out repairs to an orbiting space station module when debris from a satellite destroys her ship and kills most of her crew With the help of Matt Kowalsky George Clooney she is able to survive the blast but there are more complications in store for her The story that follows showcases her desperate attempts at survival despite enormous odds SCRIPT The story is fairly simple on its surface a woman attempts to survive in outer space despite her inexperience and the odds are against her However the writing by Alfonso and Jon s Cuar n becomes more than a routine science fiction action thriller it delves into the depths of the main character and testifies to the will to survive and to embrace life despite the tragedies of the past in this case the accidental death of her young daughter The story moves at a fairly brisk pace for the most part although the sequence with her talking to the Inuit fisherman who intercepts her transmissions went on a little too long for my taste You really do feel for her and wish for her to survive SCORE 9 10 ACTING Sandra Bullock really stands out in this movie She is never anything less than convincing and she really displays much of her range as an actress Bullock is required to carry most of the film by herself and does so quite admirably displaying her character s horror sadness rage and determination to live despite the odds She holds your attention from beginning to end George Clooney plays his part effectively although it seems that he can play the cocksure veteran astronaut in his sleep I found his portrayal a bit smarmy at times but overall he does a nice job Clooney and Bullock have a good rapport Bullock and Clooney basically provide 95 of the acting in the movie the others are basically voices that provide occasional transmissions SCORE 9 10 CINEMATOGRAPHY PRODUCTION The production of this movie is absolutely exceptional I had never heard of Cuar n before but this movie makes me want to check out more of his work The cinematography was flawless and involving the camera constantly moving and enabling us to not only see but also experience Dr Stone s plight on a visceral level The special effects provided by CGI are quite impressive showing us a detailed view of the space stations and escape modules and providing beautiful views of the Earth from many different angles Cuar n also displays an effective command of sonic dynamics especially in the opening scene where the sound gradually fades in as the characters who are floating above the Earth come into view SCORE 10 10 SUMMARY GRAVITY is a tremendously involving experience Its story depicts the human will to survive very effectively and is anchored by a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock The movie is expertly directed and the cinematography is astounding It is completely absorbing from start to finish SCORE 9 10,9
8 January 2014,A beautiful film about the lethal indifference of outer space,It s all too infrequently that a film like Gravity comes along And by that I simply mean a movie that truly shows the possibilities of what a blockbuster film can be It s very rare that such state of the art special effects and A list actors are combined together to such extraordinary effect in a film that uses these things in ways that are surprising intelligent and genuinely artistic This is Hollywood movie making of the highest calibre Director Alfonso Cuar n has to be given enormous credit for overseeing such an intensely cinematic film while underpinning it with a feeling of authenticity that elevates it to an even higher level It s a very rare thing to have blockbuster effects used in such a way to make the audience experience something so incredible that nevertheless feels so real If you praise the film to someone who hasn t seen it and they then ask you what it s about it s kind of difficult explaining the impact by describing the story It doesn t sound very interesting on paper and that is because the story ultimately isn t very important Gravity is pure cinema Where a lot of movies would work well in a book this is a film that could only work in cinema I have never been much of an advocate of 3D technology I have felt it is really just a money making ploy by the studios When I have enjoyed it in a movie like for example Dredd it s really mainly because the film itself is very good in the first place With Gravity it s the first time that it s actually felt necessary This is a film that really has to be seen in a theatre preferably on an IMAX screen such is its immersive power Visually it is a tour de force The incredible opening shot is an extended unbroken single take that simply takes the breath away Obviously this was achieved by studio trickery but it is never less than believable and goes on for what must be fifteen minutes in which time we revolve around the space shuttle hover over the Earth go up close and personal with the astronauts experience the violence of an outer space disaster and then even move into the helmet of an astronaut for a personal point of view It s simply breath taking and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has to be given huge credit for his amazing work on this film The icing on the cake is provided by Steven Price whose astonishingly effective score plays up the tension extremely effectively It s what could best be described as loud minimalist music that really feels correct for what it actually is music in a void It contrasts superbly with the use of silence which the film often is which of course is another subtle way in which it differs from most blockbusters I think one of the things that makes Gravity such an overwhelming experience is that it is so visceral visually but so intimate in other ways The huge scale of events is mixed with the deeply personal emotional and physical experiences of the central character played by Sandra Bullock Despite the presence of George Clooney this is pretty close to being a one woman show Bullock is very good and convinces consistently in what must have been a pretty demanding role to pull off so believably She brings the human aspect to proceedings making us empathise and feel the full impact of the situation Gravity has to be the most realistic portrayal yet of what the difficulties of life in space actually are But it achieves this objective in such an overwhelmingly beautiful way Ambitious pure science fiction such as this is not often given such big budget treatment In this sense it resembles the granddaddy of them all 2001 A Space Odyssey but without the mysterious ambiguity But with the beauty intact,10
3 October 2019,Highly rewatchable,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
9 November 2013,3D only-movie,This is a movie starring 2 actors you possibly know with no character development little dialog and filmed in front of a green screen If this movie wasn t starring Sandra Bullock who has proved once again that she s incredibly good looking this movie would have flown way more under the radar If I were you I d watch it in 3D if not you re missing the point of this movie which is make you feel as if you where the one who is lost in space It is indeed a unique experience but as it isn t fully enjoyable in 2D and or in a cinema if I were given a second chance I would give it a pass So it is up to you do you want to pay 10 to watch a simulation of space or would you rather prefer to watch an actual movie instead,3

20 March 2014,Depicts space like you've never seen it before,Alfonso Cuar n directs a masterpiece which deserves every award it is given Yes there are flaws like many films but these flaws are overridden by sheer magnificence and beauty that Gravity manages to create in its depiction of space and the events that occur during a catastrophic mission To put things short and sweet the visuals are breathtaking the tone is perfect and the pacing is flawless Although there are negatives for example the lacklustre narrative along with the unconvincing dialogue the film manages all what the audience expects to follow in the emotional journey through space The trailer instantly had me hyped for the film it felt unique and seemed like an experience rather than a film that you d just go to the cinema and watch and that s exactly what it was breathtaking and unforgettable I was lost in the atmosphere and drama that was superbly created throughout the film In space no one can hear you this sums up the journey that we follow Bullock through and the isolation that the film creates and puts you into Cuar n captured the mood perfectly and had me in the eyes of Bullock to feel the situation she was in and be involved with the character s emotions from the beginning to the end The technical production of the film uses techniques which are new to the genre and make the experience seem like nothing you ve felt before The score is outstanding and full of impact which feeds the narrative in order to work together and create an atmosphere which feels real and has the audience isolated in its environment The sound effects use a process like no other which have you constantly relating to the character s situation as you can literally feel what the characters do and capture the events as they happen Drones in the score and muffled sounds in the audio all work in relation to one another to depict space in a perspective that seems to have impacted cinema and shows the scale and isolation that comes in space This entire sense of loneliness that comes with the film and suggested in the tag line is cleverly portrayed in the film s cinematography though the scenes where largely effects based There is a definite sense of scale which the cinematography brings through the extreme wide shots and the minute long shots that suggests a lack of impact in space Lastly as mentioned the visual effects are just mind blowing Not once do the events ever feel unreal and lose the emotional sense that the film creates They are subtle in a way where they are not regarded and talked about as effects although they take up a large part and drive the entire story The journey is fuelled by Gravity s ground breaking special effects and was a huge influence to its overall success adding the excitement and action that everyone was looking for but had never truly discovered The visuals and the effects show space from an angle that has no restrictions and because of this creates a unique experience that has not been created before Overall the film has a perfect rating from me because I can not give it an valuable or deserving faults as I was lost in an unforgettable experience that I reckon will make a big impact in the history of cinema and will last for many years to come,10
2 January 2014,Gravity comes down to Earth with a BUMP,I have read several reviews on this film and am wondering maybe this wasn t what I was expecting Sure it starts off fast paced and a bit of action but slowly goes downhill from there Clooney and Bullock are the only 2 people in the film which makes it a tad boring Sure Bullock s performance when she is alone is very heartfelt but just watching 1 person float around and around with the camera moving too makes you a bit sick it just doesn t do anything for me When it finally ended I thought what a waste of 91 mins It had a slightly climatic ending but then nothing 90 or so mins of watching them float in space not exactly a film that keeps you interested well me anyway,2
3 November 2013,Waste of Time ... :(-,i saw the trailer and it was not that good i thought i might will see some secret scenes in the movie by which its 8 5 but i am sorry to say me and my friends were praying when the movie will end so we can go out so this movie is pathetic and i don t know how the hell it got 8 5 like its really not 8 5 worth movie guys like i always go with IMDb rating before going for movie and this time i went but unfortunately it was 1 10 seriously I m not joking don t waste your money guys instead give it to some poor guy and i was looking for some 0 digit but the minimum is 1 so i gave 1 else i would have given 0 hope next time the guys will rate the movie with some brain usage NO THANKS TO Gravity,1
16 October 2013,Visually stunning and quite thrilling,This movie is better than the trailers suggest The visuals of space are stunning Deserves a best cinematography award for sure It s refreshing that a story about space can be just as exciting without aliens and monsters from outer space The natural perils and dangers are even more terrifying And you do get all of them from debris to suffocation to fire and water You can almost feel the physical hardships that the astronauts feel The dialog is alright not annoying Sandra Bullock does a good job playing it inexperienced but not incompetent George adds his usual charming support But the acting is secondary in this movie anyway The soundtrack is a bit overwhelming at times I know they were trying to make things exciting but it could have been dialed down a bit I just saw the 2D version in a medium sized cinema screen wish I had chosen a cinema wit a bigger screen to see it,9

14 October 2013,3D or Not... Either Way Gravity Is Going To Be One Hell of An Experience.,Surpassing all hype expectations with finesse exhibiting excellence in nearly all aspects of filmmaking making exceptional use of its third dimension Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity is a cinematic spacewalk of jaw dropping beauty wonder amazement that not only succeeds as one of the best films of its year but is a marvel of technical filmmaking that pushes the cinematic art form to new realms while also marking a huge leap for VFX in cinema Set in space Gravity tells the story of mission specialist Ryan Stone aboard a NASA space shuttle on her very first assignment which is being supervised by a veteran astronaut out on his final mission Disaster strikes when the high speed debris of a defunct satellite destroys their spaceship thus leaving the two stranded in space with nothing but each other Rest of the story focuses on Stone s journey as she finds hope will to survive in the face of imminent death Co written directed by Alfonso Cuar n Gravity presents the notable filmmaker at the very peak of his so far illustrious career for he s taken a simple setting of a catastrophe applied it in space refined it with precision detailing accurate science intertwined each aspect with liberal arts and finally encapsulated the whole picture with the third dimension to provide a breathtaking experience of sheer awe astonishment while the core content also deals with the themes of loss isolation resilience mortality rebirth in a concise manner Coming to the technical aspects Gravity is a triumph in every department Starting with Cinematography Emmanuel Lubezki s camera work introduces some new inventions in 3D photography and employs the long continuous unbroken single takes with sublime effectiveness to immerse the viewers into its world And with the help of its fluid movements contrasting shots which seamlessly blends the warm imagery of Earth with bleakness of the rest of space also does a fab job in narrating the plot visually Editing trims the whole narrative down to 90 minutes which is expertly paced although there are a few moments in the middle when it feels like hitting a snag but that s only for a short duration doesn t really hurt the whole experience The silence of outer space does serve as accurate science to a considerable extent but it never stopped Steven Price to come up with a spectacular score that ultimately turned this already effective thriller into an absolute nightmare of escalating terror with its loud intense unsparing tracks Apart from its two actors almost everything in this film is computer generated and yet the crisp images retain such high degree of realism with its authentic depiction of zero gravity spacewalks explosions along with geographic view of Earth solar reflections many other elements that it further signifies the careful attention with which the whole production was carried out and on an overall scale marks a huge step for VFX in cinema Add to that even the Sound aspect is nicely taken care of exists only where it needs to As far as performances go there are only two characters we interact with in this narrative actually one for the majority of its runtime Now I m not a fan of Sandra Bullock yet here I was quite enamoured by her vulnerable character who goes through plethora of emotions ranging from fear frustration hopelessness to rediscovered resilience willingness to live eventual spiritual reincarnation Supporting her briefly is George Clooney in a tailor made role that also provided little comic relief in what is an unforgiving harrowing depiction of life in vacuum Throughout its runtime Gravity also pays tribute to a number of space classics including Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey Ridley Scott s Alien Ron Howard s Apollo 13 surprisingly Pixar s WALL E as well Although it is heavily influenced from many disaster films of the past the very experience it provides especially in 3D is unlike anything put on screen before The third dimension really adds a great amount of depth to its premise while amplifying the rest of the elements thus turning it into something that feels all the more special personal On an overall scale Gravity is a fascinating blend of cinematic art big screen spectacle that qualifies as the finest film of its year is the closest we ve come to experiencing outer space on silver screen and is an incredibly riveting thriller that s totally worth your time money Outstandingly directed finely written brilliantly performed cleverly edited briskly paced gorgeously photographed magnificently scored skilfully balancing all its elements from start to finish Gravity is as rewarding an experience emotionally as it is viscerally is deserving of all the praise it has garnered to date is a must watch on the biggest screen possible,
4 March 2014,Amazing feeling of Being There,As a space enthusiast no other movie before has given me the feeling of being along for a space trip as Gravity It eclipses by far my previous favorite of Apollo 13 which is also a great movie Much has been written about Gravity so I won t rehash any of its admittedly threadbare plot details I won t even talk about its fantastic technical merits The bottom line is that this is the closest any of us will get to actually being up in space Isn t that alone worth the price of a movie ticket I thought so For once I didn t care all that much about a deep story or deep characterizations This is a day in the life disaster experience movie and doesn t pretend to be anything more than that,9
30 October 2013,Visually stunning 3d masterpiece,Don t believe the haters I went to this based on good press intrigue was so pleasantly surprised I had to write a review When a film doesn t have many characters in it you know that it wont be long it has to look good it may not work Moon with Sam Rockwell works for me 127 hours doesn t this sure does From the opening sequence it takes you on a breathtakingly stunning visual journey I would strongly strongly recommend seeing in 3d I am not normally a fan of this I wish I could have seen on i max I am sure that s even better Nothing looks CGI although it obviously is you have a clear idea of what may happen to the central characters but that doesn t stop you being dragged repeatedly to the edge of your seat Clooney is Clooney but Sandra Bullock holds the screen effectively throughout but what surpasses both is the visual impact give yourself a treat for the eyes go see,9
20 January 2016,"Gravity is stressful, well-acted and consistently frightening, despite its thin plot.",Summary Gravity is stressful well acted and consistently frightening despite its thin plot 94 100 A The film takes you into a suffocating atmosphere and plays with your mind at times The visual effects are mind blowing and it does not matter if you watch it on 3D or 2D the experience is great It does not have the greatest plot ever but it is quite curious that a movie does not need to be rich in storyline to be great Gravity has enough visuals and superb performances to succeed I watched it with very high expectations and it did not disappoint me This film definitely deserves its high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic 96 100 and 97 respectively It was worth the hype I could not breath during the whole movie and my heart was racing I almost had a heart attack watching this Gravity is undoubtedly the most thrilling film of 2013 The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all along I am calling it now one of the best movies of the year It did not need a complex storyline or a brainy script to be a good movie The plot was quite easy to follow and understandable to me I felt connected with the characters They are not boring scientists they are humans and the dialog between them felt very genuine to me Moving on it does not matter if you watch Gravity on a small TV or on your laptop the experience is still great Damn I could watch this film like a hundred times and never get bored I also want to add that the musical score is astonishingly masterful On the upside Gravity is highly entertaining scary and unforgettable It has top notch visual effects and its final act is neat Watch it if you have high expectations or if you are a fan of the horror genre also if you liked some other films from this amazing Mexican director I am pretty sure that fans from the writer director Alfonso Cuar n will not be disappointed On the downside the plot may seem short for some people but as I said above it does not need a vast plot to be an excellent film In conclusion Gravity is a terrific piece of work that boasts the best CGI I have seen in a film a heartbreaking performance by Sandra Bullock and an impeccable direction by Cuar n A,9
20 January 2014,impressive,for images and for story for powerful emotions and for music for something who escapes to words because it has the rare gift to remind many other movies about space but be different at whole it is easy to admire it or criticize the errors but in fact it is more a letter parable than a movie the precision of technique tools the magnificent work of Alfonso Cuaron one of the best roles of Sandra Bullock are pieces of a wise puzzle about life survive fight hope and fragility a film who impress not only as complete work but for the gentle inspired manner to send a profound universal message and for visual delight who shatters the limits between chair and screen,

28 October 2013,of the rare variety that will actually inspire people to get into making films...,The story is pretty straight forward and easy to encapsulate A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space With the aid of a video reference book I once estimated that I have watched about 4 500 movies in my lifetime I especially enjoy movies that entertain through fantastic settings or story lines You ve probably heard and or read a fair amount about this movie It did very well at the Cannes Film Festival It s IMDb rating is very high 8 6 average after 100K votes and it has been 1 at the box office its first 3 weeks of its release As is fitting with a movie about space a k a the final frontier I have ventured into a new frontier myself with this film I dropped 13 for a single ticket and watched the IMAX 3D print I went into this movie with extremely high expectations They were all surpassed GRAVITY is to be honest and objective one of the greatest motion pictures I ve ever seen I predict it will continue to make piles of money I further predict it will be nominated and could very well win the Academy Award for best picture of the year Where it works get comfy this will take a little while Photography It s being said that this film sets a new and very high benchmark for cinematography That is an understatement Not only do the effects and use of mirror or stereo cameras give you the sense you are in space at times you seamlessly move from being next to characters to inside their spacesuits It is shot in such a way that you get the sense through point of view and lighting effects that you are weightless Music Steven Price s score is a character in and of itself Exciting rich somber emotional triumphant Visual Effects I view 3D even with its impressive modern enhancements as a gimmick to bump ticket prices While this film didn t make me change my mind about that I will say this I paid 13 for a single ticket and I got my money s worth The effects in the film are nothing short of jaw dropping The 3D was utilized very well and IMAX allows you to be swallowed up by the stars and the action Tension suspense Take just about every disaster movie space movie chase movie and action movie think of your top 5 to 10 do you have them in your head This film is going to make you reshuffle that list I was gripping my armrest eyes wide through 90 of this film The oft used phrase Edge of your seat was originally penned for experiences like this one Acting Bullock and Clooney are consummate professionals No shock they are going to do well Sandra Bullock owns this movie Could very well see another Academy Award on her shelf by this time next year Story plot What would appear to be a movie about survival is more about dealing with unforeseen and or undeserved consequences and moving on in the face of INCREDIBLE adversity CLICHE ALERT This is a film that leaves you feeling lucky and glad to be alive Where it doesn t work as well crickets If I have to pick something some people might find it too strenuous or come away with the thought really are they really going to have to deal with all of that But the sheer beauty impact and power of the film makes that criticism seem petty Overall I can t recommend it strongly enough GO SEE IT If you can afford it SPEND THE EXTRA ON 3D and or IMAX This film is of the rare variety that it will actually inspire people to get into making films acting directing or photography I went with a friend of mine who loved it My personal rating 10 out of 10 Masterpiece,10
11 November 2013,Elizabeth Mitchell would have been better in this role,Gravity is the first ever film I saw in 3D No I didn t see Avatar in 3D in fact I only waited to see it on TV I saw Gravity in 3D because I knew I would be able to That means all other 3D films are full of fast movement action packed scenes that my eyes simply can not withstand But in Gravity although there was some movement it would be slow and quite breathtaking with the earth down below I had to see this movie And I have not been disappointed Gravity is a superb film total 100 enjoyment even if one finds the plot quite dull at times which I have not just enjoy the camera movement the scale of it all Breathtaking did I say it already Yes I understand they wanted big names for these roles I always liked Sandra Bullock but in this particular film she was just OK for me It s a shame because there are tons of great actresses who could have done it better indeed like the impressive Elizabeth Mitchell Lost V Evolution As for George Clooney well he is OK but again I feel a better actor could have made this film even more outstanding then it is To summarise great film magnificent cinematography amazing cgi captivating plot A fantastic way to spend 2 hours Go and see it,8

12 September 2013,Realistic Until You Think Unbelievable!,The best drama I ve seen this year is Mud and I d say that the best sci fi this year would have to be Gravity I make that analogy because these are really pure manifestations of my understanding of drama and sci fi genres respectively Also seeing this movie in 3D was the first time that I was not completely distracted It reminded me more of stereo documentary footage in Los Angeles where the Endeavor space shuttle resides Wonderfully realistic until you finish watching the whole thing and think about the storyline You think This is all unbelievable None of this could have really happened But you fooled me the whole way Lastly Sandra Bullock gives a beautiful performance There are so many scenes I love It s not about the dialogue because it s predictable and simple Its just about the choreography and performance A perfect duet between Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I love them both,9

16 August 2018,Disappointing,I was looking forward to this film but it was really disappointing No real story line I like sci fi but this was poor If you saw it in cinema the visuals would prob be amazing but I don t think that justifies poor script,4

22 March 2014,Gravity flies above and beyond,Gravity is a perfect theatrical experience The visual effects are incredible and Sandra Bullock s performance is impeccable She plays her role with such convincing talent that she compensates for the movie s absence of additional characters The film is perfectly concise and not one shot or scene is wasted The visuals are highly enthralling making the audience feel the peril of drifting through space The technical aspects are brilliantly accurate as a representation of survival in outer space The cast and crew did a superb job crafting this movie which will undoubtedly be recognized as a classic space film in years to come Gravity is an experience worth beholding,9
29 March 2015,Gravity relies more on its visuals than its plot,I m really glad that this film won 7 Oscars I really do I think Alfonso Cuaron really deserves his award for Best Director As well as the visual effects team who make this film more impressive The cinematography the terrifying silence of the outer space musical score and the editing were outstanding and it adds more beauty to this film The outer space looks so realistic and impressive that I was completely amaze seeing what it s like to be in there There s no doubt that sci fi fans will love this flick But for those people who just want to see and experience a sci fi thriller roller coaster ride just like me they ll be disappointed Sure the visuals were a top notch but what about the plot The movie itself relies more on its visuals than giving away some storyline There are some few suspense and thrills but that s it The film s premise is not really that intriguing Who would want to see a film that the main character spends the entire movie floating on the space and keep bumping into stuff muttering and desperately trying to gasp for air It sounds boring The script was poorly written Too much terrible dialogue and awkward situations that got me scratching my head I don t care if this film was praised by critics I don t care if this film got 97 on Rotten Tomatoes I don t care if this film got a metascore of 96 I don t care This movie is so boring that I spend every second glancing at the clock waiting to end this film I nearly died of boredom The visual effects can t help for me to make this film better to watch Overall Gravity is more appropriate movie to watch if you re into sci fi genre But let me tell you something there s nothing wrong if you want to watch this film but it could be boring at times So be prepared I give this sci fi film a score of 2 5 for the visuals cinematography etc,2
4 November 2013,Splendid. Breathtaking. Real. ♦ 100%,We all know the degree of technicality and how charming it is that you if you want to watch it you SHOULD watch it in 3D in a theater preferably in IMAX There s no doubt the CGI VFX is terrific But moreover the film s second half focuses on life as we don t know Of course the space is one terrible one terrific place to be at the same time But the longing for life on Earth to set foot on the red soil the emotion that comes along has been captured put into reel with Gravity Alfonso Cuaron his crew has just set the bells high so that we could listen to the calm sound of nature as it continues to behave no matter what comes by Performances are outstanding especially Sandra Bullock s mighty air and emotional touch George Clooney provides the humor Supporting voices are fine Sound mixing music is pure genius Cinematography blew my mind more than the direction did and I can spend few more bucks for watching that amazing climax again Wow what a conclusive film with only 2 physical characters I am ready to overlook the goofs shortcomings when a film gives me value for money Expecting more from the makers BOTTOM LINE This is an experience you won t wanna miss because Gravity is the biggest thing of 2013 200 bucks isn t hard to come by when 3D goggles are refundable eh Highly Recommended,10
5 February 2014,Believe the hype!,The buzz around this film was phenomenal everyone was saying this is a must see title they would be correct I came out of the cinema exclaimed that is the best film of the year Essentially the film is based around Murphys Law anything that can go wrong will go wrong The story line is clear easy to follow brilliantly executed The different camera angles were excellent worked perfectly in 3D at points you do feel as though you are floating in space Bullock Clooney have great chemistry throughout the film Clooney differs from his usual ladies man role does it without fault Bullock provides a masterclass in acting any Bullock fan will enjoy this movie I would recommend this film for the tension building simplicity it is simply brilliant,9
4 January 2014,rather watch paint dry,So I guess I was curious due to all the hype to this film but don t see why Plot was non existent as absent as the level of oxygen in this film The acting was just the Sandra bullock show and finish was rushed and predictable Sure the cinematography was great but story was supa weak Surely a science type movie should be critiqued by astronauts about what would happen to give it some believability Omg if she really did go in space wouldn t have chance at all Bored and annoyed that I cant get those minutes watching this back Guess this is a love or hate type film Might also depend on how you saw it Imax or 3d might have been better but I think they spent way too much on special effects,1
30 November 2013,Try getting out of the theater. 'Gravity' won't let you.,For years film makers have been trying to convert cinema theaters into warp zones for traveling to new vistas The result is Gravity Don t say the question what would one do if stranded in space never came to your mind We have seen the images in Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey and Danny Boyle s Sunshine and those left us pretty scared Whoa we got ourselves a new genre SPACE HORROR But Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity isn t just a movie it s an experience Sitting in our seats we feel the anxiety emptiness of space adoring the beauty at the same time and gasping for air Its a story of survival embracing our fears and making decisions when the most necessary of all resources are absent Do we let the situation take control of us and lose hope or take a grasp on our life This experience is not as empty as the vast vacuum of space Its surprising how convincingly real the images are The cinematography and the lighting leave us awestruck And the most amazing part is the physics of the bodies in space The 3D immerses us further into the scene and wow we are floating Alfonso Cuaron after giving us visual masterpieces like Children of Men and Harry Potter The Prisoner of Azkaban my favorite of the eight movies lands a benchmark in every way Difficult 15 minute shots with no cuts visual transitions from third person to first in the same scene are rare achievements Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has just enlisted himself among best cinematographers ever in history Is there any stopping him He stunned us with his work in The Tree of Life and Children of Men He has even surpassed himself Flawless in every way Gravity is the cinema experience that happens only once a decade and opens our minds to new stories and fresh approach,10

14 February 2014,I need help.,I need help This is like third piece of movie series that has gigantic IMDb ratings that had made me end watching them before its over Inception Game of thrones and now this What is this How can anyone call this CGI gymnastic a movie This is a showoff of CGI capabilities that would impress anyone but is it enough to call it a movie Sandra Bullock winning some awards for acting Story awards Who gives those awards and on what criteria and where has that man finished his education Who can save me from wasting money judging movies trough IMDb ratings and trailers Maybe the best trailers would be at least first 15 minutes of movie That way I would have never wasted money on this piece of crap,1
26 October 2013,HEROES are people that are fighting with lack of gravity in Space.,As a truly passionate person about space for many years I wanted to watch this movie in the best conditions ever It happened to find myself near an IMAX movie theater this Friday in Rouen Normandy so I went to watch it with my heart open and I wasn t disappointed at all The environment Space That fascinating place where our cosmonauts dare to travel to work for science for Earth for us Think about the risks and the stress they endure to perform their tasks in non optimal conditions as long as the situation allow them to do Think about that these RARE people who have a no guaranteed ticket back to Earth history has proof and it s all recent were trained to go above us all And unfortunately there are people who had never come back The story As you can watch in the trailer a few cosmonauts are trying to repair maintain something in space more precisely the Hubble telescope but something happens and they need to stop the mission The smallest accident in space may be fatal The main characters While I had no doubts about Clooney secondary character I was afraid Sandra won t fulfill his role Bad mistake This is probably the best role she has ever had I won t enter into details but Sandra is transporting herself perfectly in her role The emotions she s getting trough are so palpable maybe I m going a bit out of the way but just remember Natalie Portman in Black Swan how she completed her role Sandra is doing as much as the same The emotions George s character is under exploited but it has enough meaning to count in the movie The Motion Picture Visual FX Sometimes you have the impression you are watching a real documentary The Earth seems to be so real the lights the shadows everything is pushed to another level so close to reality It feels so real There are many moments where you are feeling like you re inside a cosmonaut suit turning around in space at no gravity while Earth is turning as well around itself and the sun The Soundtrack In space there is nothing to carry on the sound Excellent job by Steve Price Minimal but sometimes heavily spontaneous just as like the movie is Conclusion This movie is unique in his style Survival Drama Adventure One thing is sure it must be watched in IMAX or at least in 3D Relief to really appreciate the huge amount of work that has been done on this side I guess it is the only way to totally immerse yourself in this almost realistic unforgettable adventure of Dr Ryan Stone Farewell,10
29 December 2021,A breath-taking wonder of a movie,Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney The more you speak about this film the less it is it s like won seven Oscars and has another hundred plus wins in awards the CGI work with the visuals that went in the making of this film is mesmerizing I ve always been interested in Astronomy since I was very young watching movies and documentaries related with space has always inspired me if nothing more to see space and outer space and beyond has been awe inspiring to be able understand the Creation of Allah and observe it is in itself peace for a believer and it strengthens their faith in the resurrection and the judgement so here s a very rare kinda movie about two astronauts who get stranded in space after a collision course with space debris from a meteroid and how an astronaut struggles to get back to earth The gigantic scale on which this movie is made is enormous I can t believe I forgot to upload about this one But it s a sad story We see an astronaut do a spacewalk which is very rare for an astronaut but it s necessary as well for them to repair anything on the space stations so then they have to leave the confines of their ship to do it All in space this movie is rare and one of a kind more movies like these should be made,8
20 October 2013,Not for the weak of heart... literally,Now if you have a weak heart in any way do not watch this movie Im not kidding this was the single most stressful experience of my life Watching this movie was a very intense and frightening experience its definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and it just works so well its a must see The movie kicks off with Clooney and Bullock in where Thats right space A mission specialist named Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock and a vet named Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney are working on attaching some new hardware to the Hubble telescope which will from what I gathered allow it to see much further than it currently can Now this is where thing really start to go wrong the Russians are destroying one of their satellites and the debris from the wreckage has caused a chain reaction to other satellites which has caused millions of silent killing pieces of shrapnel speeding towards our main protagonists Now the silence is key in this movie because for those of you who know that in a vacuum no sound can travel as in space being a vacuum the same occurs Because of the silence you constantly feel like nothing is rely going wrong in the movie then things get ripped apart The silence lulls you into a false sense of security making you feel like every thing is peaceful and calm but as bits of old satellite come wising past making no sound at all you just feel terrified Its one of the most affective scare tactics I ve seen in a long time If these silent explosions weren t well silent it would be no where near as affective Just seeing a space station silently be ripped apart by speeding pieces of shrapnel is so frightening and exciting it really made to movie what it is The director of this movie Alfonso Cuaron loves his long takes those of you who have seen children of men will be familiar with this This movie has very long very interesting and very masterful takes and just beautiful camera work The camera moves so smoothly panning and tracking its way around the characters it made me feel like I was in space And the way the characters move is just so accurate from what I can tell In fact if someone told me they filmed this in space I would believe them I did some research and apparently all of the space stations shuttles and other space craft are exact to what they look like in real life I also red that the fact that the satellites hit the space stations is impossible that they orbit at a different distance from the earth but this is just such a minor flaw that I m sure wont matter to anyone who watches it Another thing I wanted to mention was the music This is so key to the scares and tension The way it just pounds like a heart beat and how it suddenly rises up to the point of ear drum bursting then suddenly cuts out was just fantastic Because of the way the music is set you have to go see it in the cinema or with surround sound to really get the full affect I also want to talk about the acting Im not a fan of Sandra bullock I hated her in things like the heat and when I found out she was in this I was honestly put off But after seeing this I have to say she has earned some serious browny points She is so good at portraying the character that I was genuinely scared for her If it wasn t for her I wouldn t have enjoyed this movie so much I don t think Now as for Clooney he was great I really enjoy many of Clooney s work other than those Nespresso adds I think his a fantastic actor and gravity is no exception however Im kind of sick of him playing the cocky middle aged guy He seems to always play this character and Im a little tired of it However he was still amazing in this movie and Im glad he was casted This movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I ve seen I a long time with its masterful use of camera work music and acting it left me wondering what would happen next for its full hour and a half It was so intense I don t know if I could have taken much more of it without having a heart attack This was amazing a must watch movie,9

8 October 2013,A Neat Little Gem of Art,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie The cinematography was spectacular Bullock and Clooney were magnetic as expected I am not going to dig too deep into this film like science folk are about the laws of gravity and what not because this is a movie Yes movies can tell a story of truth and all that jazz but let s be honest will any of this ever happen EVER Most likely and probably not so to think too far into a film would be pointless What I enjoyed about this film most is the realism it gave off in the visual department I have never felt so close to space and loved every minute of it The storyline itself was a bit bleak but the actors made it worth the time This isn t much of a dialogue film as it is a film that tells the story through it s visuals You are watching what happened to these astronauts and thinking to yourself can this be real and if it were what would I do How would I feel Sandra conveyed those feelings that If I could feel I would have She showed the kind of fear that I would have and the kind of strength that any human would have in the face of fear and uncertainty No this film is not perfect and I am sure it crosses some kind of scientific boundaries but I ask you can you do better If not enjoy the film if you can I can t wait to see it If you love movies go see this and let go of any thoughts or reviews you have heard and see it for yourself you will like it,9

1 March 2014,Stuck in a Public Toilet,My god this was a horrible flick It mainly consisted of beautiful filming heavy breathing and a dumb as a sponge character Dr Stone keeps on blithering I am running out of oxygen but she just babbles fidgets and keeps babbling instead of just relaxing and breathing slowly as an astronaut would be trained to do This character was a joke She could not get out of a public toilet cubicle if she locked herself in it The only redeeming character was Matt Kowalski but then there were really only two characters in the movie I should have just watched Vanishing Point again,1
30 December 2017,A movie for people without common sense..,I felt like it is my responsibility to aware people about this highly overrated 7 oskar wining garbage I don t blame its director as he tried but could not deliver good movie worth watching its all the critics who are combinely acting like brainless fools they are acting like zombies stunned by the visual ignorant of the script Its a shame that they are critics,1
18 October 2013,Technical Brilliance,The Sci Fi s have been long waiting for a best picture nod from the Academy Looks like the time has come for them I always hated Sandra Bullock but this time i have to agree that she did a great job Cinematography Score Vfx were perfect Felt as if i am in the space thanks to 3D Alfonso Cuaron entered into another level Being an editor himself just nailed it Watch it in a good theater if not in Imax,9

14 December 2013,Many thanks to our local theater for our money back!,My wife and I wanted to like this movie we really did It was a nice afternoon out and we had read so many good reviews They must have been so impressed with the graphics that they forgot there needed to be a story to go with it After 45 minutes of generally bouncing from one batch of flying debris to another I was done and really upset that we had wasted our money on such a dull repetitive contrived story We walked out along with six others that took our lead Our theater manager was nice enough to offer passes to make up for it It s very nice to see there are still theaters that take pride in their customer service Might be worth it for 1 at your local DVD vending machine on a slow night but I won t waste my time again,1
2 October 2017,Boring,I don t understand how this movie has such high ratings I really wanted to like this movie but it just didn t do it for me All the hype and it was a huge disappointment I do like George Clooney and I have always loved Sandra Bullock The story was boring acting was boring all around boring,3
12 October 2013,A beautiful walk into space,Ever heard of the famous movie quote Survival is the spirit the soul Well Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity more or less depicts the same It s the story of two astronauts on a typical outer space mission and an out coming peril of a collateral event of satellite debris loss of communication and face of death by lack of oxygen Cuar n s selection for the cast George Clooney and Sandra Bullock justify their respective characterization It s more of Bullock s show than Clooney s The director portrays the turnaround events in a sumptuous way amidst the rapid screenplay that takes the viewer s experience to the next level The plot is inventive and unpredictable The movie flows smoothly from scene to scene with ambient effects The mechanics of the movie were too good The haul of microgravity the wafts and drifts in space is something to be lost in as a viewer and every scene backs it up It s like a beautiful dance in space Gravity not only offers you some of the most vivid images but sound as well Composer Steven price s score befits each and every moment from complete silence of space to the chaotic crashing of the shuttle and satellite debris It feels as if your ear drums were going to blow and then the next moment you could hear a pin drop from the silence The story goes too fast that there s a slight lack of hoist to it all in that regard Everything is so immediate that when it ends it more or less just relieves the viewer feeling satisfied not really left with as much as to stick with you You don t so much watch the film as experience it Notable scenes 1 The scene when bullock s tear simply floats off her cheek was brilliant 2 The heart beat pounding in some intense scenes 3 Bullock enacting the howl of a dog while inside the Soyuz space capsule and the same done by dog over the radio impart something bad happening 4 The climax scene where Bullock tries to stand up on feet after spending a brief time in zero G can be related to a baby who tries to stand up on its feet A good 8 out of 10 Likely to win some Oscars,8
1 August 2019,Enjoyable movie albeit week storyline,Gravity is a science fiction thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Cloony The movie is directed by Alfonso Cuar n and tells story of two astronauts who got stranded in space after their Space shuttle damages There was nothing major on the part of acting but George Cloony as usual impresses The movie is good but is marred by weak storyline and plot The best part of the entire movie is it s mesmerising cinematography and it s background music The climax is also weak Sandra bullock was ok but George Cloony could ve been utilised much better Overall an enjoyable movie,8
9 November 2013,Mind Blown,Okay first I wanna say that the whole 3D gimmick used in recent movies is really not my cup of tea Only used for commercial purpose useless even I remember at the end of Avatar people clapping in the movie theater I was just bored I mean yes the movie is beautiful but the story is so not original It was like watching 1983 Mission on an other planet That being said I gotta say Gravity is worth seeing on a good 3D screen It was so beautiful you kind of tend to forget the whole mess Sandra Bullock is into We heard about the first 17 minutes and journalists did not exaggerate anything The whole choreography is awesome all along the movie and even when nothing really happens well it s awesome I can t choose if it s action or drama or horror psychological horror I mean but it s definitely worth the 12 euros A must see in theaters Really don t wait for the BR release go to the movies Go Go,9

11 October 2013,MY REVIEW: The Gravity of Visuals!!,Gravity is Life Of Pi of 2013 It s a story of survival courage and human fighting spirit in the endless darkness of space Like Life of Pi 3D and CGI here are not just to make more money The state of the art technology is being used as the storytelling tool and to make your experience immersive Every frame is picture perfect and the excellent use of background score camera work acting and dialogs make most of the scenes memorable Sandra Bullock as the central character does the astounding job and George Clooney provides the much needed lightness to the otherwise tense plot There are numerous scenes which will stay with you especially the ones where our helpless characters struggling to stabilize in the gravity free world of space It s not a perfection of story telling rather it is the perfection of cinematic techniques that make Gravity extraordinary,8

10 October 2013,Gravity: Will you hold on or let go?,Since its release last weekend I ve seen Gravity described as the masterpiece of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuar n It is It s a visually astonishing film that cohesively uses all its elements cinematography sound acting plot visual effects etc to tell a beautiful and gripping story While at face value it s a thrilling portrayal of a perilous struggle for survival Gravity offers a deeper exploration into how each of us deals with adversity in life When I first saw the teaser trailer for Gravity I was instantly enthralled and excited A couple of things stood out to me First I was in the theater when I saw it so I got the full audiovisual experience and the film looked beautiful and thrilling I was instantly gripped even though I really had no idea what it was about no more than astronauts in trouble in space The second thing I noticed were the names attached to it Alfonso Cuar n is an increasingly recognized director with only a few titles under his belt but they are diverse and told with style and meaning He directed the best Harry Potter film Prisoner of Azkaban among other things Seeing something so different with his name on it is good reason to get excited Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both great actors as well Expectations were forming and I had a hunch this was going to be great My ears were perked and I was paying close attention I was dying to see it That s what a good trailer does It met my expectations Gravity s storytelling is efficient Everything is tied to the ultimate purpose of the story and the characters I just have to say thank you to Cuar n for doing that so well Most great movies do it but few big budget flicks are among them It opens with three astronauts during a spacewalk The shuttle Explorer is attached to the Hubble satellite and Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is installing some hardware to assist in her research It s her first time in space and Mission Control is getting readings indicating she s feeling a bit queasy Matt Kowalski George Clooney on the other hand is a seasoned veteran astronaut and zooms around with confidence A third member of the team is enjoying himself as well He s a nice guy with a family and you know instantly he is not making it out of this alive The voice of Mission Control Ed Harris yes the guy that was the head of Mission Control in Apollo 13 if you were paying attention lets them know a Russian satellite was destroyed and has created some debris but no need to worry Oh wait yes there is need to worry They get hit by a field of high velocity space shrapnel Ryan is flung into space completely detached from the shuttle and her team She starts to panic Matt tries to settle her down on the radio but she can barely breathe This is all in the trailer From there it s a series of obstacles that must be overcome one by one each promising a great likelihood of failure and death This is where we really get to know these characters and learn from their different approaches to dealing with extreme adversity Because that s what Gravity is all about It s a beautiful and extensive series of metaphors on life and how to deal with hardship But that part of it s not pushed in your face and it s great as it is without the reflection Dr Stone has some difficult things from her past and has kind of shut out the rest of the world since then This makes the silence of space appealing to her Matt is more fun loving but with a sure will to survive and an unbreakable calm There s going to be some real anxiety as you watch and consider how you would react in the same situation You tell yourself these people have been trained for this but only a true acceptance of the reality of death and life can really allow you to make jokes and listen to twangy country music as you drift in space with your oxygen ticking below 5 The physical situation in which these astronauts find themselves starts to morph into a good metaphor for Dr Stone s own situation down on earth as we learn more about her Isolated Silent Hopeless Peaceful As you watch you may begin to wonder if it mirrors your own life Not in a desperate depressing sort of way perhaps but in that this mortal life we all wander through the chance for disaster is upon us at any moment and once it strikes whatever flavor adversity comes in it s hard to imagine that most people wouldn t panic too Maybe it would be easiest to just drift off To let go It s a lot of work to stay afloat Ryan must make a decision that most of us are never confronted with to hold on to or let go of gravity By the end of the film we learn that rather than the shared bond between two masses gravity is also the shared bond between each of us and the rest of the human race perhaps even a higher power The choice we are faced with is to hold on and accept gravity despite all the weight that comes with that choice or to let go and drift away See my expanded review here

7 September 2014,The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR.,The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR Before I begin the review I have a qualm to express I am appalled by the way Prasads IMAX does it s business IMAX was built with a specific purpose and now with release of Telugu films which do not deserve an IMAX screen Prasads expressed that its purpose is to serve Telugu films and the films essentially meant for an IMAX release like GRAVITY have to take a backseat I wish there was one show of this film in IMAX How many do know that there is an IMAX in NASA Space Center in Florida I was lucky to be at NASA in 2010 and more so as I did see a wonderful film called HUBBLE there Now GRAVITY is a film that is based on what may have happened to HUBBLE That is all it has in common and from then on its a bumpy ride its a kind of cast away it space Where one person is caught in jeopardy and has to get out of it George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone are two NASA people on board the Hubble on an operation Now in space fixing a screw too is like an operation coz its daunting task there considering many things In GRAVITY their characters are wonderfully written by Alfonso Cuaron and both have done their jobs wonderfully and indeed Sandra Bullock has won my heart with her performance Why is Gravity so immersing is because this is not a film where merely some story is said It throws you into the action makes you empathize with the character and makes you relieved when the character attains the impossible That s how cinema is supposed to be and GRAVITY succeeds in involving the eyes and the physical body language too of the viewer too I felt dizzy at times and I am still feeling the jolt hours later Impact is such heavy and also it s all worthwhile Alfonso Cuaron who took the pain of directing it must be a relieved man now since he has done the job wonderfully in directing this marvel now can sit back and enjoy the results of the hard work The pain he took in detailing can be felt in every nuance that is there is on the screen even the teardrops the nuts and bolts wow for all those in space All my salutations to Alfonso the writer director who had a vision and he has executed it a way that we seldom see in cinema I loved the editing and the soundtrack But above all else I loved the cinematography and the visual effects Placing the camera in the right position and to encapsulate the whole feeling in the lens is remarkably done The post production work I am sure will sweep all the visual effects awards of this year Above all it s a story of inspiration and of human spirit winning in hard times When there is hope and some common sense fortune favors the brave and that s what exactly happened in GRAVITY A 5 5 for one of the most compelling experiences at cinema I wish this film was not given a break by our theater people and I also wish that this will be soon released in IMAX as I am eager to catch it up in IMAX many many times JUST LOVED THE EXPERIENCE,10
16 October 2013,great movie,Best movie of the year It saved this year for me I can t remember the last time I had fun watching a movie like when I watched this one 10 10 for me Acting was great visuals are great I watched this in 3D and it was awesome to say the least I don t want to keep saying the same thing over and over again but my review has to be longer so do your self a favor and go watch it It s great it makes you think space have rules of it s own and you must know some of them to fully understand this movie like how sounds work and how things move up there do your research and then go watch it Original movies are a rare thing those days I hop this one makes a lot of money so they will start making more like it Enough remakes we got sick of them and they are just an easy way to make money,10
15 December 2013,Gravity - A few movies that deserves to be in 3-D,When James Cameron introduced Pandora through Avatar 3D became a sensation on Hollywood As a result VFX gained more importance than other aspects of a movie As Chris Nolan mentioned 3D effects somewhat drained the essence of the story Visual gimmicks and slow motion shots became a usual sight on the movies Apart from these movies Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity stands out differently It is a movie which is shot in 3D not a movie shot for 3D Prior to it s release moviegoers all over the world were keen to categorize this movie as an upcoming fop But it turned out to be one of the major successes this year both critically and financially Currently it holds a meta critic score of 96 and a suitable position on IMDb 250 list Without a doubt it is one of the best astronaut movie ever made in world cinema It has the technical excellence like in 2001 A space odyssey and realistic treatment as in Apollo 13 It shows how fragile the life in space and how important and nostalgic the gravity is Performances from the lead Sandra Bullock and George Cloony are remarkable Gravity is one hell of ride of courage sentiments and thrill You better be rush to the theaters because so far this is the most perfect 3D experience I ever had,10
6 January 2014,Gravity vs. Nerd Rage,It s really easy to sum this movie up If you go into it knowing full well that it s a surprise movie and you are just along for the ride you ll enjoy it If you going into this thing all hyper nerd rage you are going to be sorely disappointed Sandra s performance is fine for this type of film I didn t expect anything too technical from her and she didn t disappoint Clooney is Clooney what else is there to say The visuals are absolutely stunning the dialogue only mediocre That s it folks Take it for what it is a thrilling ride around space There are technical faults and flaws galore which is what creates Nerd Rage but this movie isn t about being realistic on any level DUH,8

9 November 2013,The Film of the Year and the Future of Cinema,The Film of the Year Gravity is simply a wonderful astonishing and sensational experience that will leave you perched on the edge of your seat throughout its lean and mean 90 minute running time In Hollywood parlance it is also a game changer in much the same way that films like 2001 Jaws Star Wars Die Hard Jurassic Park The Matrix Lord of the Rings and Avatar et al changed the face of film making and storytelling forever The Lumi re brothers will be turning in their grave in delight because Gravity is exactly what they envisaged cinema to be a big bold larger than life visceral experience It is also what 3D was created for and for once does the format full justice and more so when viewed on IMAX screens Suffice to say it will Hoover up all the technical prizes in awards season and put Sandra Bullock up for Best Actress in a head to head with Cate Blanchett for her role in Blue Jasmine perhaps a more accomplished work but Ms Bullock is America s sweetheart and there is no denying the power of her performance which is at once heartbreaking and profound Alfonso Cuar n was always a visionary as his early Hollywood work on Children of Men showed but this film is surely his finest moment and has at once catapulted him into the same technical sphere as George Lucas and James Cameron as geniuses and visionaries of their craft Cameron called Gravity the best film ever made about space and he is not wrong Like all the best films the idea is simplicity itself Sandra Bullock plays Ryan Stone an accomplished scientist who has made her inaugural journey into space to repair the Hubble Space Telescope She is aided by Matt Kowalski George Clooney the avuncular captain of the Space Shuttle and another more experienced scientist Shariff Phaldut Sharma Disaster strikes as debris from a Russian satellite destroyed by a missile strike hurtles and careers into the path of the American mission What follows in the ensuing 70 minutes is a tense gripping and heart pounding survival story that will leave you breaking into spontaneous applause at the end credits The tag line for the 1978 version of Superman was You ll believe a man can fly Well you ll believe that you re in space not the space of Star War or Star Trek but the grounded reality of space as we know it The experience of working in the vacuum that is space is stupendously realised as you spin hurtle fly crash and bounce along with the characters In fact the effects are so good that I m surprised that it doesn t induce benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV in the audience Gravity is such an enormous technical achievement that in the quieter moments you feel yourself being humbled by the achievements of mankind the exploration of space and wishing that you were better at science in school You ll also marvel at the breathtaking beauty of some of the shots and two stand long in the mind a wide panoramic shot of Bullock and Clooney stretched out into space tenuously tethered by the straps of a giant Stars and Stripes flag caught on the International Space Station and the onset of the Aurora Borealis on the Earth s atmosphere as day turns into night Yup in those moments of quiet wonderment you ll be ruminating on life the universe and the existence of God and especially the latter when your eyeballs are blistered with images of such searing and startling beauty that you question whether a Big Bang really did create life the universe and nature I did anyway At the end of the film you realise that you have witnessed an important pivotal moment in the history of film and that film making cinema and entertainment will never be the same again In short you have seen the future and life as we know it will never be the same again,10
3 December 2013,Ignore the BAD reviews - this is a thinking person's epic sci-fi movie,You know sometimes people are so fickle I would like to laugh at people who turn their noses up or just feel they need to be heard and state an opinion so contrary to popular opinion so as to appear to be enlightened thinkers Even if you do not like the movie because it s not to your taste there is absolutely NO way you could give it one out of ten I personally give it a nine because I m a little bit loathe to calling anything perfection Let me tell you what it is that I like about the film and why I rated it on par with common held belief No it s not because I m a sheep The absence of dialogue and the apparent lack of action action give your eyes time to feast on the visuals and your brain to agonise over how in the hell the crew were able to simulate the conditions of space The way the camera passes through Sandra Bullock s helmet for example and allows you to see the telemetry on her visor is although minor a breathtaking effect that takes you from first person perspective to onlooker seamlessly yet transports you from the confinement of the space suit to the immense darkness of space itself I m not sure which perspective was more terrifying but having the benefit of both views enhanced the suspense that was unfolding For those who scoff and say that it was unrealistic what do these people want Of course the final scene is implausible not going to give anything away here but I found myself on the edge of my seat The long shots are jaw dropping and the flowing nature of the direction really draws you in to sharing the weightlessness and disorientation of the astronauts The major surprise for me is that the director showed his complete lack of arrogance by not prolonging the film for any longer than in needed to me 90 minutes for a movie of this budget must be unheard of but in this case less is certainly more James Cameron would have found at extra hour of filler from somewhere I for one will be going to see this movie again on the weekend just to pick up on all the stuff I missed the last time For those who didn t like the movie I suggest they go watch a film with gratuitous violence and a couple of nude scenes If your idea of a complete filmgoing experience is to leave the theatre perplexed and spend the next 2 hours with friends discussing the drama that unfolded this is a perfect movie for you,9
21 October 2013,But one thing I know for sure: It's gonna be one helluva ride.,Some movies boast an experience which gives you a solid reason why the art of cinema influence a huge section of people comparing to other arts It is the experience which is so realistic to life and yet fictitious that can provide the awe struck moments during the viewing Gravity is one such cine experience that keeps cinema distinct from other art forms by its maximum application in both sound and 3D visuals We have seen many movies related to space expedition after 2001 A Space Odyssey but I am sure none will be able to provide such a captivating experience like Gravity Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is on a space mission along with Lieutenant Matt Kowalski George Clooney encounters an obstacle in form of debris after the destruction of the Russian satellite This movie is about the efforts to survive by the duo in the most challenging circumstances Even if the film carries the clich s moments of movies carrying survival themes where character start of lose hope plans to give up moment of inspiration etc etc you will not say the movie was predictable at any point Now thats the strength of an outstanding screenplay presented by the director Alfonso Cuar n who brings you to the most exquisite cine experience after Avatar better for me in the world of space I cannot point out a single second of dullness through the whole experience and without wasting anytime the movie starts off in top gear with the splendid 10 20 minutes which seems to be captured in a single take and thus gets elevated from that point onward until its end I don t know whether I can term this movie as science fiction thriller alone because there were some bloodcurdling moments like the second debris attack which created an impact that many horror films failed Even though the screenplay is strong enough I was totally mesmerized by the visual extravaganza that made me feel as one of the character or simple step into the shoes of the lead character Thus Alfonso was able to provide a space ride and which shakes you emotionally Now if a director is able to achieve that its the sign of magnificence Sandra Bullock was simply terrific as Ryan She did maintain her signature style of acting which was groomed within the requirements of the character While George Clooney simply charmed the audience with his one liners as the optimistic Matt Kowalski Steven Price s score elevated the mood of the scenes which carried tension The score towards the end provided an epic feel Otherwise the movie carried silence at most of the parts Very few will leave without a doubt whether the film was shot in a studio Because Emmanuel Lubezki s cinematography along with superlative 3D visual effects makes us wonder how can they capture such shots with utmost realism without going to the react location Alfonso Cuar n Mark Sanger maintained the mood and flow with the editing work The works by the special effects team along with production designer has come up with a meritorious effort in creating the space world along with satellites In short this isn t just a cinema this is an experience even if you are not a science fiction fan or simply hates space stories Gravity still can enter the list of best cine experiences you had at least for me the Best 3D Cine Experience till date,10
12 October 2018,Awesome!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
30 July 2019,Visually stunning but also a bit contrived and vacuous,I recently went back to rewatch this movie As everyone has mentioned including the Academy the visuals are stunning What an amazing technical tour de force The sound and sound editing set benchmarks too That said the dialog and long long interregnums between the visual spectaculars are flat out yawners I m also finding physics flaws in how certain scenes were handled Given the precision of the CG team I m shocked these were allowed to stand Regardless this movie still enthralls See it in high def on the largest screen possible,8
19 May 2019,Gravity,A short but energizing escape Gravity is a powerful film even though it features only two characters and pretty much one setting with very little sound Sandra Bullock delivers a dynamite of a performance that is worthy of her Academy Award nomination The film is largely driven by Ryan s determination desperation will and sense of loss Gravity is also perhaps one of if not the most gorgeous space movie I have ever seen it s use of color and just the overall cinematography is truly unforgettable In the end whether or not the character survives or how realistic the science is behind it doesn t matter a bit as we have been taken through a hell of a ride,8
15 October 2013,"""Gravity"" is one hell of a ride..",The excellent staging is impressive and disturbing influenced by the strong acting performance by Sandra Bullock Impressive especially when you she was not the first choice for the role of Dr Ryan Stone considering For the physician Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock it is the first trip in space It is with the crew of the shuttle in the orbit Explorer to install a new module on the Hubble Space Telescope She is with the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney Shortly before the completion of their work for outdoor use the Explorer receives the message from Mission Control in Houston that in a test a Russian satellite was destroyed The resulting debris destroyed in a chain reaction of other satellites The resulting debris field races with more than 35 000 kilometers per hour around the Earth in an orbit that crosses the Explorer Stone and Kowalski are warned but they do have time to react What remains is the flight to the International Space Station before their oxygen runs out it begins the struggle for survival Due to the deafening silence they know that they have lost contact with the ground and thus any chance of rescue Their fear turns into panic while every breath reduced their small supply of oxygen Alfonso Cuaron delivers one of the best films of recent times in which the presentation the narrative pulse sound design installation photography everything seems close to the perfection Stunning images captivating atmosphere dramatic events and all perfectly accompanied by harmonious sounds No symbols metaphors and messages tucked inside the story that asks the audience to interpret themselves However if someone is hoping a futuristic space adventure with plenty of action will surely be disappointed Gravity is quiet but fascinating credible and genuine because we get to understand that space is beautiful and cruel at the same time It is a visually stunning sci fi drama with grandiose and impressive 3D effects Most small movements are choreographed and performed with the utmost care because in many cases the actors as a kind of puppet supported to convey the illusion of weightlessness If cinema is a visual media I think this is the best example we will encounter of this wonder of cinema The photography by of Emmanuel Lubezki and the music by Steven Price enrich the visual nuances With 91 minutes of runtime Gravity is extremely short Alfonso Cuar n focused on a dense narrative that fascinates the first few minutes rather than unnecessary points to draw the story in the length as soon as the danger is noticeable it grabs the attention and seamlessly goes until the end,8
6 May 2015,Big fan.... that could not watch it all............,I am big Sandra Bullock fan but I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this movie The only reason I did not give it one is just to acknowledge the visual effects Other than that this movie is beyond bad I really like Sandra as an actor and as a person Still I could not go beyond 20 minutes into this nonsense Yes it is that bad Good visual effects can make a great movie like Contact a wonderful one But here i don t know it was like putting whip cream on pile of s t The sad fact is we live in a time some people actually like that bothe the movie and the pile,2
13 October 2013,A superior space experience that must be seen on the silver screen to be believed,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
23 December 2013,"It's a disaster, in the sense of not a space wreck, but a train wreck",I m brain damaged watching this I thought I was getting used to wearing two pairs of glasses in a bid for the visual impact and everything 3D films pack but they apparently were much too obsessed with packing this baby with copious amounts of debris ripping your retinas scenes I loved them and I walked out of cinema stuffed to the gills and feeling queasy Huge portions for bulimic audience are made not to whet your appetite they are ruining this otherwise alright movie because they wanted this baby so larger than life that it appeals to all palates like on the spur of the moment they kinda decided a woman with some extra platinum vaginae are hotter than lesser chicks Of course their decision set off a chain reaction as implausible as the one caused by Russian satellites in the movie they expect everything to work fine in the form of traditional sci fi from last century as if space walk is still conceptual and space stations are not floating in orbit The jokes they cracked would have worked fine if it were at least set in the near future Don t mess with what s already public knowledge courtesy of the media such as that they do receive intensive training before going up there and few of the complex maneuvers are carried out to the accompaniment of shopworn banter And they are basically two insipid word spewers who talked till everyone else died and talked some more I miss my daughter who committed suicide at four cuz she couldn t take more of my constant nagging and Clooney went I have flirtatious eyes we are running out of time and oxygen but I ll ogle you some more When Clooney died Stone freaking talked with herself and woofed to dogs down there via the radio getting only lukewarm response from them apparently they don t like a heavy breather who barked like an asthmatic Labrador However for those who said no one see objects moving faster than bullets you do see supersonic aircraft They didn t defy all physical laws and there are some redeeming factors still it s undoubtedly a space wreck film for train wrecks,1
17 October 2013,Visual that you can not visualize ever. Must see 3D movie ever,Visual that you can not visualize ever But Director Alfonso Cuaron had visual in his mind first and he conceive Gravity with unimaginable manner No words to say wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow Fantastic movie don t miss to see this movie in 3D if you miss then you may have to wait another decade to experience movies like this Hats off to the director Alfonso Cuaron I am wondering how director made other technician to understand every frame of this script Especially Cinematographer of this movie After director all credits goes to Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki You can not realize that you are seeing space in camera you would feel like you are one of them watching everything happen in space Cinematography is soul of this movie Thanks for giving us the fantastic experience,7

27 October 2019,A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE ! A MUST WATCH (preferably in IMAX 3D) !!,Mexican director Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity is a spectacular enterprise that AWES us from the very first frame with its sheer brilliance and could well be counted among the defining movie experiences of our lives If movies are an endeavour in collective dreaming this is one hell of a dream which would remain with us the viewers for a very long time For the cost of a mere movie ticket the director transforms the audience into astronauts and transports them to space such that the entire movie hall seems suspended in space for about two hours The movie s plot as such deals with a catastrophe set in space and its aftermath First time astronaut Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and her experienced mission commander Matt Kowalski George Clooney are on a space walk mission with their team to repair the Hubble telescope Disaster strikes when a debris cloud from an exploded Russian satellite comes hurtling at them The debris destroys their shuttle the telescope and also kills the rest of their crew and space walk team leaving them adrift and spinning in a very vast and lonely space without any means of communication to their command center on earth at Houston The rest of the movie is a race against time thriller wherein they need to find each other and escape to the safety of terra firma Yet at the very heart of the movie is an engaging and inspiring tale of hope resilience courage and grit that defies overwhelming odds of astronomical magnitude one may add The brilliance of Cuar n as a director is in his intelligent and seamless enmeshing of the scientific spectacle visual wizardry and a very human tale of hope He creates a very vivid image of the loneliness and utter helplessness that confronts a human being in what could be one of the most hostile environments to endure and survive Cuar n creates an immersive experience for the viewer by effortlessly switching the viewer from a third person watching the action from a safe distance to a first person when we look at the happenings through the visor of Bullock As a result the helpless free floating spin of Bullock and her breathlessness when her oxygen levels plunge are very real and palpable experiences for the viewers themselves Cuar n masterfully combines the skills of his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual effects team to present striking visuals with a silken flow as they effortlessly pan out to showcase the breathtaking beauty as well as the unending vastness of the space and zoom in to capture the tense expressions of the leads There is also a remarkable eye for the detail be it the careful and measured movements of the astronauts at work or their frenetic efforts to grapple at a hold to stem their free fall or the floating specks of flame or even the globular drops of tears or other pieces of flotsam which presents a well detailed and realistic setting For a movie that spans about two hours Gravity depends almost entirely on its aptly cast two Academy Award winner leads viz an excellent Sandra Bullock and the suave smooth talking George Clooney Sandra Bullock puts in a riveting performance as Dr Ryan Stone bringing in just the right amount of vulnerability melancholy and grit to the part The significance of her performance is accentuated by the fact that for the better part of this movie she is the only human element who anchors the emotional content of this movie and in the process lifts it from being merely a spectacular sci fi eye candy The silent vastness of space filled with enormous yet empty distances between far flung celestial bodies and presenting beauty that is both captivating and foreboding alternatively is the other major dimension of the movie Gravity belongs to a small and rare category of movies that succeed in questioning and extending the hitherto known and accepted horizons of film making It is also one of the few movies which capitalises on the scope and depth offered by the IMAX experience to the hilt and is sure to be the front runner for a clutch of technical categories including cinematography and visual effects at all major award events for the year This is a movie experience that inspires the viewers at several levels and is sure to spark many a young hearts to nurture the dream of donning a space suit One also hopes that it would also inspire many more film makers to conceive and conjure many such pioneering movie projects which could navigate the collective dream experiences of the audience to hitherto unexplored newer directions,9

9 June 2014,Utter tripe,This film is utter tripe From what I can gather it has achieved success because of 2 factors 1 It has a deep story about a woman regaining the will to live 2 It has some good 3D effects To address the second first if a film cannot stand without its effects it is not a good film The second point might be true but it is utterly lost in the physical nonsense and painfully fabricated situations Synopsis of the film below Several astronauts on a spacewalk Unlukily the Russians shoot down a satellite which causes a Flying Cloud of Debris Luckily it s no concern Unluckily it escalates and becomes a concern Luckily they finish what they are working on and start to evacuate Unluckily the Cloud destroys Everything In Space Luckily the pretty one and the handsome one survive Unluckily everyone else dies Luckily the ISS is just over there and the handsome one has a jet pack Unluckily the pretty one is running out of oxygen Luckily the handsome one has plenty Unluckily he runs out of fuel just as they arrive Luckily the pretty one catches the ISS on the way past Unluckily she lets go of the handsome one so he dies Luckily she gets into the station just as her oxygen runs out Unluckily it goes on fire Luckily she escapes in the remaining pod Unluckily it s tangled with the ISS Luckily she cuts it free Unluckily the Cloud of Death comes back Luckily she gets away as the ISS explodes behind her Double luckily there s another space station which she can easily get to Magic Unluckily the pod is out of fuel Luckily the handsome one comes back in a hallucination to tell her how about some other fuel Unluckily when she gets to the Chinese station it s re entering Luckily she gets into the escape pod just in time Unluckily it s all in Chinese Luckily she presses a few buttons and it returns her safely to Earth Unluckily it sinks in the sea Luckily she gets out The end If you want a film about astronauts overcoming serious disaster in space watch Apollo 13 It is more gripping and true so it actually makes some sense,2

13 February 2019,Great Minimalist Space Film.,My Rating 9 10 I REALLY enjoyed the film the first time when I watched it on the big screen Revisiting it now in 2019 on a smaller TV screen certainly doesn t have the same feel and effect unfortunately and then you get to thinking how someone who hasn t experienced it in the theatre would feel This was visually next level and I hadn t experienced such wonder and marvel in a cinema hall before It s just beautiful to experience that feeling of being in space which is what this movie pulls off so brilliantly Those giving it a low rating I can understand because it s rather minimalistic and doesn t have an extravagant feel like Interstellar or Inception Honestly a great GREAT movie experience at the cinema and one I will never forget,9

8 October 2013,Fresh and Gripping; Space Masterpiece,Gravity the movie that s been talked about for quite a few months now is something unlike any other It has extremely beautiful shots dazzling visuals gripping narrative and fantastic music Alfonso Cuaron director of the third Harry Potter film has a guaranteed a spot as one of the masters of film making with this film Set in space a very intriguing setting Gravity is a survival thriller about bio medical engineer Mission Specialist Dr Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski and their exciting tale in space as debris from a Russian anti satellite test creates a chain of destruction that damage their space shuttle and leave them stranded in space The movie is pure thrill There are so many unexpected situations and each of them is memorable The suspense starts fairly quickly when their space shuttle is hit by high speed debris The music elevates the tension and therefore each of the suspenseful scenes never fails to please the crowd Dying and getting lost in space is quite a terrifying scenario and terrible way to end one s life and therefore you re going to be on the edge of your seats as the action ensues The visuals were magnificent Space is intriguing and this movie provides plenty of space panoramas We see different parts of the Earth from space and it s just splendid I also loved that the shots were long instead of short unsatisfying ones The scope of the setting is massive and this is meant to be seen in a large screen possibly IMAX The 3D is pure enhancements and it s definitely recommended Gravity doesn t have too many characters to play around with Instead we focus on Sandra Bullock s Ryan Stone the female protagonist of the story The other leading guy is Matt Kowalski portrayed by George Clooney By not having too many characters we get to take a look inside these characters really get to know them and this film does it especially with the character of Dr Ryan Stone The movie is headlined by two Academy Award winning actors and they are nothing short of excellent here Bullock is so good in portraying the role of Dr Ryan Stone here She brought all the emotions here and was great George Clooney was also impressive as the slightly cocky Matt Kowalski although his role is less compared to Bullock s They are experienced actors and this film shows just how professional they are Brilliant That s the word for the film Gravity Never before have I seen something like this It s gripping it s beautiful and perfect This year has not been a very successful year for sci fi but Gravity is different from the rest It may contain more drama but it is nothing short of spectacular Not all will find the brilliance but older audiences should discover just how magnificent this film is Gravity is wow Rating 10 10 Final Verdict Gravity is an experience like no other and will engage audiences with its thrills visuals and plot as if it s gravity itself,
27 December 2018,Get grounded. Big time.,One of a handful of space films that wreck your life for indefinite years But in an oh so good way Best film Sandy or George will ever make The last half hour akin to 2001 aso morphs into this super transcendent wtf climax culminating with a simple line thank you that turns the whole damn thing on its head and thus you find yourself frantically backtracking through your memory of the film for the spiritual clues But you couldn t watch it again that would ruin its sacred splendor As I said a cinematic timeless masterpiece with a weightless floating theme that will shake you to your core,10

11 October 2013,My 2/10 Rating Is Made To Bring Gravity Back Down To Earth (Actual=8/10),I really did like Gravity and don t actually think it deserves a 2 10 but when I saw the 8 7 rating my expectations went through the roof The trailer didn t really interest me and the hype was really the only thing that made me see the movie It was pretty much exactly what I thought it was going to be A survival movie that shows both the physical and metal aspects of being alone in space as well as being disconnected from the world It also has references to the origin of life as well as a lot of religious undertones I think part of the reason I didn t love this film as much as others is because I am not the biggest fan of survival movies If you like survival movies and the preview had you hooked you will love this film as much as the others on IMDb If you wondered what all of the hype was about you still might be wondering after the movie I d give it an 8 10,7
7 October 2013,Changes the Meaning of a Movie Experience,This film truly takes you on a ride Technology and exceptional filmmaking ingenuity have come together perfectly to not only portray the struggle of the characters as they battle to survive in outer space but to give the audience a perspective that makes them feel completely immersed in an environment where they ve never been before Sandra Bullock and George Clooney put on remarkable performances that make you feel a sense of connectedness and empathy for each of the characters However what makes this movie truly exceptional is the perfectly sequenced and detailed effects of the CGI Clearly the filmmakers spent a great deal of time and effort to perfect every detail which goes a long way to give that audience an experience they ve never had before Whether you know a lot or very little about the physics of the universe you will be amazed by the reality of space making this movie one that will stay on your mind long after you leave the theater,10
4 October 2013,The director Cuaron must have been born under a lucky star,I ve read both Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman were ready to play Sandra Bullock s part Neither would have reached the delightful heights Ms Bullock does Trust me out of the three she is far and away the best choice halfway through this arresting movie I was thinking how completely perfect the casting was and that casting is of Clooney and Bullock Apparently this movie was blessed from the beginning in being able to land the one star who was capable of lifting this movie way beyond even its lofty ambitions The idea of bringing a story like this to the screen is a completely reckless one There are so many obviously impossible shots in this story only a madman would have agreed to tackle it And yet it works From the moment it started I was physically engaged in the action For once it paid to watch it in Imax and 3 D but I m not sure the movie s impact would have suffered if I watched it low tech The story is a simple one of survival in space But that s enough to make it utterly unforgettable in the way only the best basic science fiction used to pull off when I was a kid There are leaps of logic here but you won t mind them if you have any heart,9

4 October 2013,Alfonso Cuaron has done it again!,Alfonso Cuaron is behind in my opinion the best Harry potter movie in the series the prisoner of azkaban and also directed one of my all time favorites children of men but gravity is one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time I wasn t around in the 70 s to experience Star Wars in the movie theater or around to see 2001 a space odyssey in theaters but I did get to experience gravity in IMAX 3d The opening 13 min scene in space is so beautiful and sets the pace for the rest of the film I have never seen a movie so intense and emotionally griping as this one George Clooney and Sandra bullock have performances of a lifetime I can easily see these two getting award nominations for this movie This is the best film of the year so far it s a movie that must be seen in theaters Some look at the trailer and only see 2 actors and space and will immediately turn away from this film but this film was directed and paced so perfect this is a 90 min roller coaster ride that never lets up You ll be at the edge of your seat the entire movie wondering what s going to happen next This is a must see movie do not miss this experience If you can afford to see it in 3d I recommend it the visual effects are so perfect that the 3d adds so much more to the movie I have never been a fan of 3d but this is just so beautiful 10 10 Alfonso Cuaron has done it again,10
22 September 2015,As vacuous as space itself,I know this flick is classified as science fiction but as it is not set in the future and clearly refers to real present day entities NASA the ISS Soyuz I couldn t watch this as a sci fi movie If you know anything about manned space flight and care just a little bit about plausibility and real life physics you will be disappointed As many people have pointed out in the goofs section a lot of the movie is incorrect and implausible starting from the main character s background and training to orbital physics to idiotic plot twists I face palmed so many times while watching this my forehead still hurts Factuality aside the script doesn t make up for it On the contrary it is littered with clich s and platitudes to such a degree that it is embarrassing While the protagonists stumble from one cringe moment to the next drama unfolds in the most predictable ways I could invariably foretell the next 5 minutes at any point and as such the story is utterly boring and left me completely disengaged I could not have cared less about the fate of Bullock s character I even was slightly disappointed she made it out alive against all odds and no this isn t a spoiler this outcome has been telegraphed throughout the film The acting by both Clooney and Bullock is uneventful and especially in Bullock s case sometimes downright pathetic probably aided by idiotic dialogue written by clueless imbeciles The only 2 positive notions are the sometimes grand visuals but not as spectacular if you ve ever seen real imagery shot from the ISS and the short run time I liked this fact a lot it somewhat reduces your suffering My tip watch some real grand sci fi instead like 2001 Dune the Fifth Element or such you know a movie with good story engaging characters and nice pacing and effects,2
11 December 2013,A Perfect Movie,There is not a thing that I would change about Gravity It s straightforward and its execution is flawless This film accomplishes two things so well that it deserves praise it makes you feel great about being in a theater and it makes you happy to be alive If you ve heard anything about this movie already you ve heard something alluding to how it makes you feel like you re in space how stunning it looks visuals etc and its true Having seen Transformers in IMAX and Resident Evil in 3D huge wastes of money Gravity reinvigorates the need and greatness of 3D and IMAX that Avatar promised Gravity not only joins the field of best 3D movies but directly challenges for its top spot Gravity hit closer to home Cuaron just chose a simpler more realistic plot didn t waste any time with annoying filler its only 90 minutes and reminded us that going to the theater is sometimes really truly worth it This simple premise of escaping earth for just a moment tapped into so many themes relating to individual human experience that it created an unexpected rush and excitement that most action movies can t even accomplish One of the more important themes that is felt throughout is the choice of truly WANTING to live The main character has a tragic past and has simply been carrying on in life without any hope or joy anymore Suddenly she is faced with the option of a beautiful death the truest darkest quiet easy fade into nothingness And our main protagonist must dig deep into herself to choose to live or not This kind of theme may have been approached before but Gravity truly makes you FEEL it I will definitely return to watch it again Beautiful film,10
17 November 2013,Shocking!!!,I will not go into full detail about the plot in the film but if there was a worst film of all time it would go to this one The plot is so mundane it actually sends you to sleep There is nothing going on in the subplot it is quite obvious what happens next To give it its due the first 10 minutes is watchable If you want to fall to sleep this is your movie Someone should actually make a 5 second youtube clip about this movie it would do it full justice The graphics may be better in 3D but i was watching in 2D and they were better than average but if you go for a movie on that basis then by all means it may be OK It outraged me to see the score on IMDb and i actually even had to write a review,1

11 December 2013,A gripping tale of survival,Everyone has been talking about how amazing Gravity is and fortunately no one had spoilt the film for me I was already stunned by the visuals of space right from the beginning The magnificent views from an unearthly viewpoint looking back at Earth with the bluish hue of the atmosphere around its edge is truly memorable On the other hand the trade off is that there is much dangers in space let alone the challenges of the unfamiliarity and the weightlessness environment In Gravity we see the two astronauts in grave danger and they have to fight against literally all odds just to survive The magnificent desolation as an astronaut had described becomes deadly hopelessness I cannot remember another film that made my palms sweat the way I did and it s been a quite a while since I literally held my breath waiting for critical events to unfold Gravity successfully delivers suspense in every scene chronicling their impossible struggle to survive Gravity is not just a film but a gripping tale of survival in space that will engage even those who aren t astronomically inclined,
5 November 2019,Boring,Really boring storyline you can probably predict entire movie by just watching first 5minutes doesn t deserve 7start,1
24 March 2014,Gravity (2013) Movie Review,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9

15 December 2018,Say no to drugs,Visually stunning Who cares if a movie is visually stunning when the story is horrible How this movie can hold a 7 7 on imdb is beyond me If you like normal movies stay clear of this one Waste of time,1
17 April 2016,come for the amazing visuals,This movie without a doubt has the most amazing visuals ever The effects are so stunning it really puts you in the environment and emptiness that is space And the unforgeable long shots that drove on and on for sometimes 6 8 even 12 minutes Being a curious camera operator myself interested in what it takes to be behind the camera I sat there for ages thing how did they pull that off Some of the shots I don t even think should be possible ever There was a camera shot where the camera went into Sandra Bullock s helmet mind blown Also the amazing CGI of the explosion and silence that was well used as a key element of suspense The story on the other hand which is the most important part of a good movie not the greatest I found the overall story to be pointless and quite boring It had its moments of suspense every now and again making you think what are they going to do but it wasn t enough to keep my attention on the movie,2

2 March 2014,A Waste Of Good Space,The only thing I have to say about this movie is if NASA really do employ astronauts as inept winging and useless as the bunch depicted in this movie then its a miracle they ever got anyone into space at all never mind on the moon This is the worst film I can remember in years and I can truthfully say I will never watch it again because it is too boring and pointless to even consider having to sit through it again The special effects are good yes but so what the special effects are good in most films in the modern CGI era and we now accept that as a matter of course anyway so why on mother earth everyone is ranting about the oh so brilliant special effects when they are just the norm in most films nowadays is beyond me The storyline was for the 5 10 age group at best and the dialog between the actors was written on the back of a fag packet in about 10 minutes That is all you need to know about this film don t buy it don t rent it don t see it at the cinema its a waste of your money and you will realize it about 15 minutes in If you must see it out of sheer curiosity like I had to then get it for free by downloading on the torrent sites and it will be the best money you never had to spend and you will feel so money supermarket afterward,1
11 January 2014,Just appalling...,I m in shock having just watched this movie in fact it s not quite finished and I feel I have to write this Now I love Sci fi and fantasy it s almost all I read And I love a space film wish there were more so many awesome books that could be realised into film Also I can watch most things that people slate take it with a pinch of salt I say BUT this movie was appalling I seriously struggled not to turn if off From the ridiculously inaccurate physics of the thing from start to finish to the complete awfulness of the production I despair that this has 11 Bafta nominations it s worrying I recently watched 12 Years a Slave what a movie that only got 10 Gravity is Hollywood as it s very worst This movie just deserves 1 big Turkey award A huge insult to Astronauts and science in my book,1
16 March 2014,This movie is wasted potential,I seriously don t understand all the hype around this movie And I have long decided that the Oscars are useless and made up of 60 year old white men who don t know the difference between a fun film and a critical film I did not see this in theaters Wish I did so I could have enjoyed the cinematography to the fullest Storyline is extremely weak and boring How did it win so many Oscars Sandra Bullock is jumping from one space station to another in succession I ve seen way better space movies and I am a huge sci fi fan It was a disappointment and I am glad that I am not the only one of the audience who felt so Critics have given this movie two thumbs up but judging from the reviews om IMDb seems to me the general public share my opinion This movie is a waste like most other Hollywood trash these days,1
8 October 2013,Pale Blue Dot,Greetings again from the darkness Hopefully you aren t expecting yet another in the seemingly endless stream of unadulterated praise fests for Alfonso Cuaron s critically beloved and audience pleasing Gravity While the mass appeal is certainly understandable I ve never been one to sit back and accept the surface value There are two elements for discussion here the visually stunning and technical marvel from a filmmaking perspective and the emotionally manipulating and somewhat emptiness of the narrative story telling and characters On the technical front one would be hard pressed to come up with a more impressive film It is simply breath taking especially when seen in the format it should be seen 3D IMAX Rarely if ever has space seemed more real more beautiful and more ominous From the extended opening take Cuaron is known for his long takes to the numerous shots of Planet Earth from dominating the screen to reflections in helmet shields we are drawn in to the space walking and perils of Kowalski George Clooney and Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock From an entertainment viewpoint the film works as high stress thrilling space mission gone bad and ultimate survival story What left me feeling a bit distracted and hence quite annoyed was the often eye rolling dialogue seemingly designed to force our connection with the Clooney and especially Bullock characters I prefer to experience my own emotions in both real life and in movies obvious cues and manipulating tugs through weak character development drives me away from rather than towards the desired connectivity My issues with the film are not related to the numerous scientific issues identified by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and astronaut Buzz Aldrin This is all explained away by Mr Cuaron s statement that the film is not a documentary If we can be cool with Forrest Gump creating the smiley face we can accept that Sandra Bullock can navigate her way between space stations with a fire extinguisher Despite this it s tough to argue against the technical marvel and thrilling experience created here The 3D adds depth of field and adds a touch of realism rather than the gimmicky tricks we often see with the format With only a couple of jarring exceptions Steven Price s score is minimal and complimentary to the quietness of space Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki Children of Men re teams with Cuaron for the extraordinary look Some of the symbolism was a bit overdone recurring umbilical imagery for the re birth but it s done to ensure no viewer misses the point Finally I got a kick out of Ed Harris voice coming from Mission Control think back to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13,7
27 April 2021,unique experience,This is good Deep experience of space survival worry being in a trouble hope broken devices Reminds me of similar personal experiences such as with broken devices vehicles electricity computers phones tools Not much positive Looks like some bad and good dream Can be compared to hope as in wars and other troubles High presence of technology nature details Just bit too complicated and unrealistic The most unrealistic part is that it can happen in space like that without any readiness or support and being that much unlucky and lucky later especially surviving hot falling ball into Earth,9
14 December 2014,Armaggedon inside a 2001 box,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
17 October 2013,Must see,Gravity is a visually stunning movie that was enhanced by the 3D IMAX at Universal Studies in Los Angeles The storyline was somewhat predictable but the attention to detail and visuals were amazing From the opening scene which combines the silence of space with the beauty of the earth the movie draws you in Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were outstanding in their roles and I totally believed that Sandra was weightless as she floated through the space station I read that these scenes took a long time to shoot to get them right and the result was worth the effort The movie also managed to maintain the tension throughout the film without becoming just another thriller,8
13 October 2013,"Going to space would be cool, right?",It s every kid s dream to go into space and one day venture into our Universe With our galaxy alone being so large it s no wonder that becoming an astronaut is a dream for many people since it is a chance for silence beauty and peace But what if there was suddenly no one to hear you The black space full of stars was now filled with shrapnel headed towards you at very fast speeds What if you no longer had no control over yourself Gravity is an excellent movie with arguably Sandra Bullock s best performance of her career With George Clooney as the perfect co astronaut the exceptional casting in this film definitely helped The thought of wandering the Universe and exploring the unknown ends is a dream to some while drifting away without end is a nightmare for others Overall Gravity is a great film due not only to its superb special effects or compelling acting but because it strokes the strings in every person s heart for adventure and thrill It is a reminder of what our Universe has to offer and the potential for all that can happen to us,7
21 October 2013,"Great musical score, CGI and acting--particularly Clooney",Is George Clooney the most underrated actor out there While this is obviously Sandra Bullock s movie and she s great in the role I m not so sure you would have cared as much had Clooney and his character not been present His calm and selfless demeanor was the counterpoint to Bullock s natural overwhelming fear when things began to go bad I can t think of another actor in that age range who could have pulled off Matt Kowalski s role maybe Brad Pitt on a good day Just a nit Bullock s character referred to Matt Kowalski as Lieutenant twice I have to believe an officer of Kowalski s age and experience shuttles since 1995 would be higher up the food chain minimum Commander most likely Navy Captain,9
26 March 2014,"Visually Stunning, Laughable at Times",Gravity is a beautiful film It shows how far we ve come in special effects It portrays itself as a realistic film that is with realistic images of floating in space flying through the atmosphere etc I can t decide whether this film is a 7 or 8 I think 7 5 just for the images in space the curve of Earth the space stations the reflection off the glass Sandra s breathing condensing on the glass Sandra s effortless floating glide through the Russian and Chinese stations Quite visually beautiful But really it is more fantasy than science fiction I think I would have rate this higher 8 8 5 if I knew to expect a fantasy film But I feel a bit disappointed as many others Almost none of the physics are real and it defies what really happens in space and defies NASA protocols For accuracy here s an astronaut s comments http www vulture com 2013 10 astronaut fact checks gravity html The script from minute one was just bad at times George Clooney trash talking and zipping around without a tether He d be released from NASA never be allowed in space again Acting by Clooney was actually better than acting by Sandra Bullock who more or less played herself She is a bit kooky and she has a bit of her Miss Congeniality in her George also played himself but somewhat had more charm than Sandra Too much testosterone However the best moment was when Ryan Stone Sandra drifts off into unconsciousness and she imagines or is it communication from the dead It is a well crafted touching scene with Clooney and Bullock talking And then she talks about her daughter The girl with one shoe I believe she said A statement on our mortality Perhaps the best drama scene in the film Definitely this film deserves the Oscar and BAFTA for visual effects and cinematography and maybe a couple more But Best Director or nomination for Best Actress It s an empowering film for a female lead It empowers Sandra Bullock And inspires many young girls to be an astronaut perhaps Liberating and uplifting But really if you check the URL above almost nothing would have happened As pointed out Sandra s character Ryan Stone would have never been trained in a simulator Worst Sandra doesn t quite portray a woman of confidence or science Rather she relies on the manly Clooney coming to the rescue Dr Stone is more like Dr Claustrophobic and Ms Panic She s not the composed strong woman that a real astronaut probably would be in space Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney would have never let go and leave her alone There is no gravity acting on Matt in the scene where she is caught in the lines and he is holding on It therefore kind of resembles joyride of Armageddon Yet Gravity is a better film Gravity is a dramatic movie with little realism but still plenty of fun It actually reminded me of another extract yourself from the debris action movie Daylight with Sylvester Stallone But Daylight has a remote likelihood but Gravity lacks most realism That is why I laughed at Ryan Stone s eight or ninth time she should have died Perhaps she is a Terminator Never dying A superhero She needs a cape Gravity ranks among the best films based in space but it clearly isn t 2001 or Contact The latter film with Jodie Foster is much superior in script acting direction and even comes close with nice special effects Gravity is a 7 7 5 and Contact might be 8 0 8 5 Gravity has nine lives It s your day Dr Stone I wonder if Cate Blanchett or Julianne Moore might have been a more credible calmer Ryan I would have like a stronger woman in charge more convincing as an astronaut Just that the opening scenes and Ryan s goofy inexperience in space make her reminiscent of Miss Congeniality Gravity might have been the best science fiction fantasy film of the year If only the plot was more realistic and script were better Then it might deserve a spot as one of the best space films But even with flaws the visual effects rank it high among the very best if that s your piece of cake For space films it deserves a top 10 12 rank For fantasy scifi top 25 But that many Oscars Yes we will be all asking that question ten years from now as there were many better movies in a strong 2013,7
22 January 2014,Don't believe the hype...,OK so this movie receives 10 Oscar nominations everyone rants about how good it is and that it leaves you awestruck after watching it As a sci fi enthusiast you go and see it and surprise it s the Avatar effect Through the roof CGI which cost enough money to feed half of Africa but that s about it Cheap character development absolutely no story no back story multiple situations which I am sure Nasa would say are all 1 100000000 to survive and Hollywood sequences in which the hero always gets saved in the last hundredth of a second It gets really boring really fast Let s get the obvious out of the way the CGI is amazing although not better than Avatar Everything is perfect and visually you really enjoy it And for those of you who think that CGI makes a movie yes Avatar and Gravity are the best movies of all time for those of you who agree you can stop reading this and just go watch the movie The moment this movie begins it s just I can t explain it any other word SILLY Three astronauts are making repairs on a satellite while one of them floats around jokes and sings with Houston while happily using his gas inside the suit to propel himself onwards of course later he runs out of gas in a crucial situation I guess NASA astronauts aren t really that smart The other astronaut is making repairs while being sick usually you don t go out of the house when sick but hey apparently Houston approves of going into OUTER SPACE again So things start to go wrong and after that the whole movie becomes a series of Hollywood they re not gonna make it but then they miraculously make it in the last second situations After the 3rd situation you start to get seriously bored You wait for it to get good but honestly it doesn t There is no character development and you don t feel for the characters You don t care if they die because everything is so unreal and silly that you just don t believe it I will say the worst thing you can say about a movie you know the whole time that it is a movie When you watch Alien 1979 you know the alien is not real and that the chances of it existing are next to none but you do feel scared you feel anxiety and that is what good film making is about You don t experience such a feeling in Gravity maybe a couple of minutes Someone on the board said it right this isn t actually a movie No plot no character development everything just happens It s more of a documentary OK I know that the whole movie is a metaphor and is representing the hero s struggle of coming to terms with a certain accident in her life but there a couple of other such movies which are sooo much better This one just isn t believable When I heard that it received 10 Oscar nominations I seriously lost all the little respect I had left for the Oscars I guess a realistic depiction of water drops in zero gravity is enough to be nominated for 10 Oscars in our time Again don t believe the hype,4
19 October 2013,Gravity is out of this world. Roger that - over and out,Is it a bird Is it a plane No it s George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as they star in Alfonso Cuaron s Children of Men Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sci fi spectacular Gravity Houston we have a problem Tonight s weather forecast clear skies with a chance of satellite debris Medical Engineer Dr Ryan Stone Bullock and NASA Special Commander Matt Kowalski Clooney are on a repair mission in outer space when a Russian satellite shatters and its shrapnel races towards them Mission Control voiced by Ed Harris initiates an emergency abort just before all telecommunications to Earth crash When you re suspended in the cosmos and the narrative is thus restricted to a single location all there is to relish besides the remarkable views and special effects is character development However this is as far from a bad feat as our troops are from home Where it is easy for a sci fi to get carried away with itself Cuaron s profound characterisations of our spacewalkers who share extraordinary on screen chemistry grounds the spectacle in reality so much so that science fiction appears to be science fact Gravity is predominantly based in one location with one objective yet the Mexican born director does extremely well to grip our attention and the mesmerising visual cinematography makes it a pleasure to concentrate Clooney renders Kowalski with unbelievable strength of character able to take the responsibility of the interstellar jester despite the severity of the situation I know you never realised how devastatingly good looking I am but you need to stop staring he says to Dr Stone as they cling together in the abyss Advised by fellow director James Cameron Cuaron delayed production for four and a half years so that the technology could catch up and meet expectations The wait was certainly not in vain as Tim Webber s visual effects are simply groundbreaking There is no weight in space There is no sound in space and the only light is what bounces off the Earth explains Cuaron during a Gravity masterclass The dramatic thriller gives testament to these interplanetary conventions to an expert degree In true Cuaron fashion for the first 15 minutes there are no cuts The long take soaks in the sights at the same time as it lures the spectator into a false sense of tranquillity Kowalski s wit and charm as he playfully floats about sends us further into relaxation Clooney refuses to shrug off his debonair persona and proficient flirtation even in the face of death 600 kilometres above the Earth s surface All of a sudden we get a sharp succession of cuts as danger ensues The camera becomes very dizzy as it stylishly coils around our troubled astronauts instead of the actors moving the camera does all the donkeywork The debris tears through their shuttle and telescope leaving the duo adrift Although there is no sound in space there is music in film declares Cuaron The music in Gravity composed by Steven Price is harmonious and at times even terrifying unless of course we re talking about the Hank Williams Jr country western jive that plays out of Kowalski s radio epitomising his breezy persona Driven by pure heart and the will to survive this story about letting go toys with symbolism of birth and rebirth paying unspoken homage to Children of Men in where humankind loses the gift of fertility As the loss of her daughter plagues her mind Dr Stone on several occasions showcases foetal characteristics When her oxygen supply plummets Kowalski attaches a tether cable symbolic of the umbilical cord to the distressed space newbie in order to get her to safety Stone is later seen poised in a zero gravity pod and her behaviour is strikingly symbolic of a foetus as it curls inside the womb Gravity is out of this world Roger that over and out www MovieMatrix co uk,10

2 October 2014,A theme park ride of a movie like no other,91 Whether this really is film of the year is entirely down to the individual but it certainly is one of the most remarkable awe inspiring cinema experiences I have ever witnessed No other film gets even close to the feeling of actually being in space and terrifying events taking place as much as this it certainly is as close as I ll ever get The effects are nothing other than true big budget magic at its best it really does feel like it was shot out there and not one second feels anything other than the case The direction is sublime and the performances from the very small cast are perfect So as a cinematic thrill ride it s highly recommend but once it leaves the big screen and like so many great films particularly these days I suspect it will lose some of its strength on the transition to your TV So in other words watch it now in the cinema or miss out its worth every penny in my opinion,10
20 October 2013,Gravity - Wow!,Travel in India but I will never miss any chance to experience a cinema going activity in any exotic locale not to mention it is Alfonso Cuar n s GRAVITY the sensationally topical follow up to CHILDREN OF MEN 2006 9 10 a firmly prospective Oscar bait and is on its way to procure an unanimous triumph from both audiences and critics domestically and internationally a rare feat which is hailed as the most innovative film in executing the ubiquitous 3D technology after AVATAR 2009 9 10 I was at a relatively large 3D screen hall but if you can find a screen with IMAX plus 3D which is the quintessential option The film runs a succinct 96 minutes at first I found myself a bit distracted by the murkiness of the screen with the clumsy 3D glasses double glazing my myopic spectacles one primary reason why I don t enjoy 3D films on the whole so as to I didn t quite adjust myself to appreciate the opening scene thankfully a belated captivation comes when the debris attacks this survival tale begins to gnaw at its audience in a very good and exciting way Floating in the infinite emptiness the extremity of terror and helplessness is oppressive and overwhelming Sandra Bullock confidently and believably pilots us into a journey of wonders we don t know what s the odds here for her to pull it off the miraculous landing on earth it is her relentless mettle and stamina shock us inspire us and strike a chord with us Bullock s hallmark of underplaying her character s choppy emotion does a clean sweep to deliver a top notch impact in spite of a comparatively thin script it is a tour de force performance in her career and a hard earned honor for an actress who can overcome the glass ceiling to lead a commercially prosperous Sci Fi fare in her age what s more important she is also a top billing comedian presently Clooney serves slickly as the experienced but not too lucky astronaut most of the time he is hidden inside the space helmet and uniform but generates a wake up call on the nose when he displays his usual Clooney esque mien Cuar n does know what audiences want GRAVITY is a ground breaker a high tech adventurer and seeker and fingers crossed it will eventually give DP Emmanuel Lubezki his overdue golden statue after 5 nominations divinely shot scenes include the trademark ever rotating long takes the resurrection emblem of a fetus inside the uterus the final victory when she rises out of the sea as a giantess etc maybe for Cuar n and his sterling production team as well sound department art production and visual stunt It is a film beyond everyone s imagination and it edifies you so much with so little to tell like an essay it is concise but cogent and with a collateral effect to blow your mind PS I am planning a rematch when the picture will arrive at the end of November in China hopefully in an IMAX screen finally,9

10 November 2013,"Heart stopping cinematography, acting, and plot!",Gravitational force tangential velocity and inward acceleration aside Gravity was the perfect film to get the gears for geeks like my friend and I a photographer and a geochemist rolling with its phenomenal views of earth from space intricate and elaborate details of the insides of space crafts heart wrenching portrayal of the struggles with loss solitude and despair of the main character and the amazing attention to details that make the film almost believable in the problem the plot presents to her In the end we were left asking as we wandered out of Ward Theater in Honolulu Hawaii could this happen in real life A discussion to be had over a couple of beers and a sandwich at Big City Diner for sure The intensity of Sandra Bullock s performance as the main character Dr Ryan Stone is incisive There are several moments throughout the film where the deep emptiness loneliness cold and despondency that can be found in space and that was promised in the movie trailer really hits home It s gut and heart wrenching and for those moments even this slightly clinical observer was left with a tear in her eye George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky played nicely off of the character of Dr Stone His is a charismatic character that appeals to the hard worker in me the resentful one that has yet to achieve something of greatness but is ready to be done Add to this great acting and desperation that the plot introduces fantastic visions of the earth and its atmosphere as viewed from outer space and what we have is a chilling interpretation of what it is like to be completely abandoned by hope and embraced by futility in an environment that is a paradise the character cannot enjoy This was an amazing film the best I ve seen in months I highly recommend it Oh and see the 3d version It s an uncanny experience,10
12 October 2013,A Short Review,The first 10 minutes I couldn t touch my popcorn because the film was so quiet well it s space duh I didn t want to disturb the others also it was one of the most beautiful opening sequences I have ever seen Visually the most pleasing film of the year Cgi is used for good purposes vis vis art cf The Tree of Life Direction is so masterful and it s the most powerful part of the film that it becomes an experience Themes are life struggle death Ryan s story is very sad I was close to tears It s a survival film But we haven t got a survival film like this before After watching thousands of films it s surprising to see a film which can have a huge impact on the audience Sandra deserves an Oscar for those emotional long takes Quickest 90 minutes of my life,9

27 April 2014,Intense!,There are many elements that are a good starting point for suspense One of those is most certainly a complete lack of gravity When you find yourself in the realm of outer space and a freak accident leaves you without a ship to which to return you have a tense situation This is a very creative idea for a story and it was carried out very well Rather than being on the edge of your seat as the old clich goes you will instead be clamoring for something to hold onto as you witness Bullock and Clooney in their struggle to keep from drifting into the nothingness of deep space I would gladly revisit this film in the future and perhaps there is a spot for on the ole DVD shelf,8
6 April 2014,Don't take it for realistic. Enjoy it as the fiction it is.,Realism flies out of the airlock the moment you see Clooney flying circles around the space shuttle with his jet pack The MMU is such a freakishly expensive piece of hardware it hardly ever got used And as such these kinds of joyrides just wouldn t be in the mission budget So yes this movie stretches reality to enhance drama Because let s face it while interesting watching astronauts doing maintenance missions isn t what i would call breathtaking But whenever possible physics were portrait in a realistic manner And in style Technically this movie is a masterpiece The atmosphere is so breathtaking you d be tempted to blame the vacuum from the silver screen sucking the oxygen out of the cinema Never was space felt so intensely The only thing that annoyed me was the script Clooney acts too airy and Bullock seems too emotional for astronauts After all these are supposed to be handpicked professionals and yet they react a little too human to those life threatening situations In reality they wouldn t have the slightest chance to make it But well it s fiction for us common people and i guess we need something more human to relate to So yea i can overlook these shortcomings for this fantastic space spectacle,8
23 January 2018,All 5 points are for visuals,I wanted to like the movie so much I thought to myself this movie got 7 Oscars it has to be somewhat good Turns out the only thing that can be considered decent are the visuals and even there not everything is top notch Let s get the worst out of the way really quick the horrible story What a mess Constant logic gaps bigger than the grand canyon mediocre acting and hideous dialogues It really is not a good story at all whatsoever At no point in the movie did I feel any connection to the characters That wouldn t be so awkward if I didn clearly notice that there was supposed to be drama and there was supposed to be tension but it jsut didn t work for me Camera work on the other hand is great A lot of extensive scenes with no cuts make it almost feel like a one take especially because the few cuts are placed very smart Effects are well digital Not to say that this is a bad thing but a lot of the effects look pretty ridiculous in comparison to Interstellar which was released only a year later Nontheless the effects and camera work is what made me watch the movie until the end It s all I will have a positive memory from with Gravity,5
29 March 2014,Fantastic movie!,Wow reading all these comments from people who were asleep during the movie I was hesitant to watch Gravity Lessons learned Don t read amateurish comments This movie is amazing I swear I was dizzy the whole movie and am upset I didn t catch it in the theater You don t know what way is up and when you watch you feel weightless It s a simple plot that apparently was lost on some who watched it There are no murders no subplots to make you think but absolutely stunning special effects that put YOU into space with Sandy The movie deserves all the Oscars it received It didn t win for best picture for a reason the special effects are the star of the movie and you WILL be talking about it the next day,10

8 October 2013,"Space is cold, both physically and emotionally.",To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour William Blake These words came to mind after my experience with this movie event called Gravity I ve read the spoilers I read the stories on the making of the film and how in its conception it was not technically possible to achieve I counted the positive and negative reviews and always came back to my question How is it this film only recently came to my attention I followed all the news as Jackson tried to keep the filming of his Lord of the Rings trilogy private with great attention I knew the stories from numerous readings throughout my life and how blown away I was upon my first viewing of Jackson s interpretations which unfortunately that excitement didn t spill over with the over bloated Hobbit installments Gravity offered just single word that ultimately captures both the scope and plot of the movie so perfectly it would be hard to make it any simpler or complex The father and son teaming seems very successful in the sculpting of this story I became aware of Alfonse during the Harry Potter days Indeed The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite piece of the franchise Then he released the gritty Children of Men with his epic 7 minute single shot exodus scene twords the end of the film For me sitting under water for 7 minutes would seem impossible but I don t think I dared breath as the fighting raged on during that ending segment I have also rarely if ever seen a movie where the cast of on screen actors was limited to two for the duration of the film with only voices being a part of the credit list As suggested before this is not so much a plot driven movie as it is a personal account of a chain of events set in an ominously empty environment You sit in a theater The lights go out and suddenly you are projected into space You sit like an astronaut in your seat but instead of a suit and helmet you are holding your popcorn and observing the focus through a pair of special glasses we were given the wrong ones You are immersed in the dark Action picks up fairly quickly and as any good story that is based on the laws of Murphy you get bumped around from one catastrophe to another I found myself actually flinching behind the 3D glasses as shrapnel gets thrown at you from the various wreckages and once again I found myself not breathing Going into this knowing the length is only 90 minutes long you are open to all sorts of parallel time lines At the end which leaves you back in something more familiar you take a deep breath of satisfaction and know things are going to be All right My only comment that could be considered somewhat negative was once the right 3D glasses were obtained my first impression was This is kinda like looking through a ViewMaster With enough twist and turns a solid beginning and a solid end and incredibly produced you wonder how other films that lay in the quagmire of mediocrity stand a chance to even make it to the big screen Then again you realize that some directors have incredible talent and vision I read somewhere that James Cameron was involved in the initial development and said it was impossible to do simply because the technology was unavailable I am happy to say this did not deter Alfonse Cuar n His vision became an extraordinary reality I rarely go to an IMAX simply because I m a cheapskate but I don t regret going to see this one bit Confining this to a 60 diagonal high definition screen could not possibly give you the scope and gravity of this movie See it big See it 3D if you can handle it See it B,10
8 October 2013,An visual marvel and an intense thriller,Alfonso Cuar n s gravity is a gripping thriller that manages to pull you in the tagline of the movie is Don t Let go Gravity is a film that also takes advantage of its 3D A film that for its short running time 90 minutes without credits manages to scare me more than most recent horror movies I ve seen The film is real and it s not afraid to show that The plot follows Dr Ryan Stone a bio medical engineer who is on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky who is on his last mission before his retirement While on a spacewalk out disaster strikes after a space debris from Russia causes a chain reaction of destruction and they have to abort the mission Things get worse when they lose contact with mission control Left alone with just each other Stone and Kowalsky have to make it back to earth before they get sucked into the endless void of space The first fifteen minutes or so of gravity is quiet its just Bullock and Clooney talking to each other The action kicks once their attacked by the space debris from Russia and things get interesting The plot of Gravity is very intense I haven t seen a movie in a while that s gripped me as much as Gravity did This is a serious story Although it s not the best female performance I ve seen all year Bullock is quite good She manages to convince me that she really is lost in space and I also felt for her character I imagine if I was drifting in space alone I d probably go berserk but Bullock as Ryan Stone manages to keep her cool and her character progresses throughout She starts out in the film panicking and screaming but by the end she manages to keep her cool and I honestly believe she s stuck in space and trying to find her way home George Clooney is basically playing himself and he doesn t have a whole lot of screen time this is essentially a one woman show might have spoiled it for anyone who hasn t seen the film but he s still fairly witty and manages to give some pretty decent one liners The visuals are in Gravity are amazing The opening shot of Earth is beautiful or as the film likes to put it breathtaking The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is spectacular We really get to see space and the planet I don t think I ve ever seen a movie that showed space and earth quite as good as gravity did The 3D in Gravity is excellent as well While Gravity is post converted 3D it s not the usual post converted 3D crap we re used to seeing This is a film that uses 3D to its fullest For example when the ISS International Space Station explodes several parts of it come flying I ducked my head more than ten times despite the fact that I was aware that it wasn t real But that s how real the 3D in Gravity is I highly recommended you see it in that format Gravity is an intense thriller It s not a blockbuster but it doesn t need to be It s a film that doesn t have much of a soundtrack and the soundtrack however short it may be by Steven Price is beautiful but it doesn t need one Its runtime is short 90 minutes including credits and it moves at a brisk pace This is a movie I highly recommended you see,10

4 October 2013,Been Waiting a Long Time For This One,It only took 45 years for someone to top Kubrick s 2001 And now it finally happened Not only was it technically near perfect but Gravity had a solid story and great acting from Bullock and Clooney to boot I m trying to picture another actress in Bullock s role but I can t imagine anyone who could have done a better more believable job of it I ve been a fan of SF films although this isn t really SF for about 60 years now and started reading in the SF genre when I was about 10 years old My two favorite films to date until now are 2001 and Bladerunner Of late the only one that even came close to them was Avatar 3rd best You may be able to find some technical glitches in this film if you look real real hard but I bet they ll only be trivial All I can say is move over 2001 and Bladerunner you just got some brand new competition for my vote Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron Nice piece of film work indeed,10
4 December 2013,Crap movie that looks pretty,Stunning Yes Its beautiful and if you have to see it definitely see it in a 3D IMAX or you really will have wasted your money Take away the special effects and it is really a bad movie Sandra Bullocks character is not likable at all I couldn t have cared less what happened to her The dialog and actions of the astronauts are cheesy and patronizing You do get a sense of the isolation that astronauts must experience in space but this is cheapened by the clearly ridiculous and impossible things they do in space All fur coat and no knickers as they say If you re going to an IMAX theater my money is on Hubble 3D instead The trailer for it before Gravity was the best thing about the whole movie experience,2

18 September 2017,Ridiculous nonsense,If you enjoy films with zero credibility and the sort of film in which there is crisis after crisis for the heroes to deal with where you are supposed to feel happiness for them after resolving one problem only for yet another unbelievable disaster to arise then go and watch Gravity But if you have any self respect do yourself a favour and give it a miss If you think it s got great graphics then go and watch some REAL YouTube videos for example  www youtube com watch v uR4xB83h76k,1
14 April 2016,Strip away the 3D effects and what do you have left? Not very much I'm afraid,When I was a kid growing up I was a great lover of science fiction I would devour stories by the likes of Arthur C Clarke John Wyndham and H G Wells and as a kid before I had any television in my home I became entranced with radio Sci Fi programmes such as Journey into Space and The Kraken Wakes In my teens I became a fan of early TV Sci Fi such as Dr Who of course The Twilight Zone and how can I ever forget Star Trek with the indomitable William Shatner By today s standards many of these programmes were pretty corny particularly with regard to the special effects but I loved them and the stories just caught my imagination For many years as a young budding author I dreamed that my first great novel would be in the science fiction genre I suppose the last science fiction production to take me in hook line and sinker was the wonderful 2001 A space odyssey which I went to see in London with a friend when I was about 23 years old Sometime after that I can t say exactly when or why I fell out of love with science fiction Every film or TV programme or book seemed to be yet another variation on a theme and for some reason I could no longer suspend credibility and become immersed in the fantasy It was all too boring and frankly corny despite the millions spent on special effects and prosthetics that were supposed to transform humans into credible aliens I will probably upset many of my readers by including such acclaimed masterpieces as Star Wars in my boring corny category These wide screen extravaganzas that cost obscene amounts of money to make and have attracted hundreds of millions of viewers throughout the world leave me cold I actually fell asleep through one of the Star War epics when I was dragged to see it by my family It was all too silly and superficial for me So in a long very roundabout way this brings me to Gravity which is hardly science fiction at all as most of what takes place is almost within the bounds of present day feasibility But it s as close to Sci Fi as makes no difference IMDb classify it as Sci Fi so I confess that I was probably already predisposed to dislike it before I pressed the start button There is no question that the film relies heavily on its special effects to woo the audience so if you like me watch it without the benefit of 3D then I m afraid you may be in for a tiresome 90 minutes I am told that the 3D effects are incredible and I don t doubt it but strip them away and what do you have left Not very much I m afraid I think I would rather watch a present day Doctor Who episode than this Gravity tosh and I haven t seen many of those in recent years as the bore factor kicks in The Gravity story is simple Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are on a space walk around the Hubble telescope way out in space The brilliant Sandra is in the process of trying to fix a faulty part on Hubble when all hell breaks loose They are showered in debris which was the result of some Russian missile doing something it wasn t supposed to do and are they cast adrift and lose contact with mission control back on earth Their own space ship is disabled and the remaining personnel are all killed The remainder of story is about their attempts to get back to Earth by trying to propel themselves to alternative space crafts Russian and Chinese that are floating around the firmament in various stages of disrepair It is unclear what happened to the inhabitants of these craft There is little or no character development and I was unimpressed with George Clooney s cardboard hero persona and his distinctly unfunny homespun dialogue Bullock lurches from crisis to crisis telling us along the way about her dead daughter which is supposed to make us feel even more sorry for her and screaming and sighing at appropriate moments when it seems all is lost To be honest you don t particularly care whether either of them make it back or not and you certainly shed no tears While many may enjoy this spectacle on the big screen in all its 3D glory if it is stripped of that major selling point the dialogue acting and even the music rarely rise above the mediocre What astonishes me about this movie is that yet again the professional critics are raving about it and it picked up a whole gamut of BAFTA awards including best British film best Director and best music and an amazing 7 Oscars including best director best cinematography and best music Call me a cynic but is this the George Clooney Sandra Bullock establishment connection Just in case you think I am alone in thinking that Gravity is just a piece of mediocre dross let s see what the good folks on IMDb have been saying Stop advertising this as a good movie I just don t understand why this score and all the good reviews over the net are all about This movie has no story development no character development and the script sucks Gravity is Weightless Did those who ve written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did Honestly they go on and on Just what is it with these professional film reviewers and us amateur dummies Just who is it that knows a good movie when they see one,3
14 February 2019,Felt a little hollow,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
20 January 2017,Symbolically on point,You re in space your shuttle is broken The rest of the crew is already dead your commanding partner s corpse is floating forever into weightless oblivion and you re alone so freaking alone and scared the only sound thing to do is just break down and cry while waiting for the inevitable oxygen depletion Yet with no reasonable way of surviving Dr Ryan Stone still manages to drive it home in the most stunning rebirth parable that has ever come to life on film Being such a unique story about a woman s journey to personal deliverance feel free to gush over not only Bullock s astrodoc but this beautiful movie itself A win for the female portrayal this film has a womb in which the heroine grows it forms a safeguarding placenta around her lovingly nourishing and healing the pain away until Stone is well and truly ready to let go of her emotional shackles and emerge crying and wobbly legged into wet existence with the first gasp of a newborn blinking against the first light In a rare case of silver screen transcendence the character isn t the only ferocious female subject worth mentioning Gravity itself is,10
8 March 2014,7 Oscars? That's It?,Sure 7 Oscars is a lot but still only 7 I was on the edge of my seat for the last 2 3 of the movie I agree with many people in the fact that this the future of cinema So many films could be inspired off of this one because it creates so many ideas to build off of even though I hope that doesn t happen If you don t like this movie you need to watch it again I m sure you ll like it more if you do so Think what it would be like people if you were floating in space without any knowledge of whether or not you are going to make it back to Earth Cuaron Alfonso brings that experience to life as realistically as possible while you are just sitting in a seat This movie had all of the qualities that I and a lot of other people look for in a movie in space Steady camera angles mind blowing special effects breath taking zero G environments brilliantly realistic space shuttles exhilarating action sequences and thrilling backgrounds and such That just covers the special effects The acting in this movie is unparalleled and will likely not ever be duplicated Yeah it s that good Bullock and Clooney are so emotionally involved that you feel you are actually with them when you are watching You might anyway They are a dynamic duo in this movie If there had been anyone else in either role the movie wouldn t have been nearly as good There are so many things flying around in this movie that you have to watch it several times to just notice half of it For that I can understand why it won best special effects of the year The movie is not only intense in the sense of action but it is also very emotionally intense at times and it can almost bring tears to your eyes if you are sensitive enough The script is really very clever because even though for a portion of the film there is only one character the writers somehow kept a lot of words thrown in there Sandra Bullock talks to herself a lot and by doing that keeps the viewer informed on what is happening She explains everything she is doing to herself out loud and without this the viewer would have no idea what was happening The score of this movie does not seem like it would fit with the actual movie because it is so subtle and not very intense However it is one of the most awe inspiring and inspirational themes I have ever heard I can understand why it won best original score It is also spine tingling if you are involved enough because there are some deeply fantastic vocalizations included There was a goof I found At the beginning it says there is nothing to carry sound But the whole movie has small sounds thrown here and there outside of the shuttles and in space Unless the sound waves are bouncing off of the shuttle and that is what we are hearing I don t know It all still sounded really very cool The director and writers of this movie are cinema geniuses That is because they extended a very short story up to 91 minutes minus the credits so about 85 and they still didn t make it at all dull That is a pure stroke of genius in the cinema world Even the opening scene with the facts about how extreme space is is masterfully crafted I don t know how but it is There is also some humor thrown in on the side of things which makes the movie even more enjoyable if that is possible In conclusion this is a white knuckle roller coaster that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end Thanks for reading this review especially because I went 1 5 months without writing one See ya,10
19 October 2013,Another great British science fiction film!,Why doesn t IMDb show the UK as being the country this American financed yet British produced production came from Did they remove it By any normal standards this is yet another British made picture with superb CGraphics created by Londons Framestore the whole production being made at Pinewood and Shepperton Studios near London In fact its in the whole tradition of great British science fiction films like Star Wars Alien and 2001 all requiring exceptional special effects These particular films have the effect of advertising supposed American technology which is not in fact American a naughty lie If you want it American make it in America and tax benefits have nothing to do with it as all countries etc offer those,8
17 December 2014,An Exhilarating Experience!,I saw Gravity when it came out in theaters and I will never forget the spectacular feeling of awe I saw watching this film The visuals are astounding and so lifelike I recall Alfonso Cuaron saying he had to invent the technology and my gosh Earth never looked so beautiful on the big screen The sound design is also amazing and when we sync the sound with the visuals we are in for a treat The story however is merely average It s not bad or anything but it s nothing new It does add a sense of realism and danger This is a realistic space movie so we cannot believe that three legged aliens will come out of nowhere Instead it is just about a mission that has gone wrong Alfonso Cuaron s film is about two astronauts named Dr Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski who are stranded in space after their shuttle was destroyed in a collision with broken satellites Now they must find a way back to Earth even if that means traveling across the globe in space For the most part this movie is a one woman show I think Sandra Bullock did a fine job in this role much better than people give her credit for George Clooney s screen time was not long but he effectively countered Sandra Bullock This is one of those survival movies that don t rely on a huge cast and it works better that way Overall Gravity is a very good movie especially in regards to the technical design That was beyond impressive and it made for quite an exhilarating ride at the theaters I remember how me and the audience was blown away by Earth and space and the lack of sound in space The story is a little thin or perhaps simplistic will be the better word to describe the story But I did like some of the dialogue and the in house jokes referencing a certain space movie from the mid 1990 s All things said this is a solid directorial effort by Alfonso Cuaron I rate this film 8 10,8
10 November 2013,"Atrocious & Boring, Waste Of Money & Time",This movie bored me to tears so it deserves a 1 score i fell asleep it was so boring but i was happy to snooze as this film was so bad i did not think i need to stay awake to get my moneys worth I use this site and always check the rating before parting with cash to go to the cinema as its quite an expensive affair IE 3d and imax So i thought it must be good with a score of 8 5 After seeing the movie and how bad it is i think someone has hacked this website and adjusted the score Something is badly wrong with the world if people think this movie was good This is my first ever review i have been using this site for years i just felt it my duty to save people from wasting there money Basically you could condense it into a 30 min mediocre movie and be less bored but they stretch it out with scenes of people floating about in space it reeks of stretching the film out to the 90 min minimum There was a few good bits but nothing to make up for the rest of the dreadful film I really am baffled by the 8 5 score The people leaving the cinema at the same time did not seem that impressed it was like what the hell did i just watch it should have been good I think the movie company has gave the website owners a bung to improve profits,1

17 November 2013,The Conceptual Review,Gravity is a movie all about ourselves raising beyond the gravity to a state of achievement The environment puts us into various challenges which pulls us to the ground level however we need to raise to the heights of excellence to fulfill the dreams Meanwhile the process of excellence demands sacrifices in that journey which needs to be adorned The well effort ed satellites dreams of life sometimes explode and go un repaired That s the time we need more and more oxygen to breath in take in all the confidence and fearlessness and get our mind in the state of balance for moving forward We may need the help of experience of friends relatives guides and mentors but its we who have to continue the journey and reach the destination The movie takes us into such various stages where everyone is stuck at some point in life where a question arises as whether all the human effort is made before accepting the defeat Its God who help those who help themselves Its the capacity and the caliber of the director Alfonso to direct such a movie to take ahead with only couple of artists who keeps running the show for the entire 90 min in great 3D effects Its just the Sandra and George who keeps us entertaining On the darker side of the movie the audience shall be more or less interested in the achievements rather than the effort put forth in the process which the director does not give the clear view Though its all about standing high amidst challenges the greatness of a person shall be in presenting himself as effortlessly flawless in spite of being surrounded by drowning challenges Another point of notice is that its better to give people the examples of situations which seems more familiar to them rather than choosing the space domain which most of the audience may be unaware of Any way the director and his team s effort is fantabulous and is indeed successful in conveying the message that any success story needs seamless effort and sacrifice,7
9 October 2013,You don't need IMAX or 3D or Aliens to make a great space movie,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
28 August 2019,Nothing to do with space,This movie is just an emotional drama under the disguise of space venture sci fi In fact the movie rarely cares about the limitations of physical capabilities in space Doesn t deserve the academy awards for best movie and best direction,1
28 January 2015,I Loved It,I don t get some of the hate I have read on here I am not surprised Gravity won all the Oscars it did as it is ridiculously visually impressive I am surprised Bolock did not win for Best actress as she more or less carries this film on her own And that is not a slant on George Clooney who I am a fan of but this movie is all about Sandra Bullock and its impressive visual effects Plot In A Paragraph Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a medical engineer and Matt Kowalski an astronaut work together to survive in space after a catastrophe destroys their shuttle and leaves them adrift in orbit I loved this movie and really wanted it to do well at the Oscars I was disappointed Bullock didn t win and even more disappointed Clooney wasn t even nominated but I was not surprised with the ones it did get This is a movie that needs to be watched on Blu Ray on a big screen with great sound,9
21 October 2013,An amazing Realist Epic Thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat,Gravity was probably one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen It was very REAL every single thing that happened in the movie could have happened in real life and could have played out quite similarly The Realistic approach combined with the spectacular acting with the story was very intriguing thrilling and kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole time Sometimes when a Realism theatrical show is released they cinematography falls to the basic Naturalistic almost stock state This Epic kept its realism approach across the whole spectrum bringing me into the real void of space above the earth through its picture sound music and special effects This story Follows that of Ryan Stone as she is trying to fix the Hubble Telescope and things go drastically wrong with another satellite As her story is followed the developments leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next The story also follows the realism concept and is in true to life setting that still has the amazing cinematic thrill that I seek in a movie One thing I MUST recommend is that if you go to see it you see it in 3D There is no other way to see it the 3D did not hurt my eyes at all and it was so good that I jumped 3 or 4 times in fear of something hitting me And although I did love the 3D my mother who was with me said that she did get a bit motion sick but not from the 3D it was just the fact that the camera was spinning Overall this story and movie was one of the best I have ever seen It comes highly rated and deserves just as much Its portrayal from Actor to cameraman and from Grip to concept designer was absolutely perfect I will watch it again and again,9
18 July 2014,Highly overrated,What I find most distressing about this movie the critical acclaim This movie has so many script plot and performance problems it s hard to believe the professional critics aren t getting royalty checks And Sandra Bullock being nominated for best in a lead role by any organization suggests that there was a lack of quality moving making and acting in 2013 or the system is rigged I m am so glad I waited to watch on DirecTV rather than going to the movies If I had paid to see this movie I would have felt ripped off A few redeeming qualities Visuals some suspense and the storyline does have you thinking about the difficulties of living and dying in space,4
31 October 2013,"Real space has much more life, than displayed in this movie",The physics are ridiculous a story is almost non existent the characters flat like men s breast Do you know how I felt watching this movie Like watching a commercial for an automobile For 90 minutes Same slow motion effects same shiny or blinding visuals same desire for destruction Acting Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were just robots from an Asimov book Their characters seemed like they were programmed to imitate human gestures And at no moment they seemed to get in touch with reality Not even with the movie s reality The whole movie itself is happening on a virtual plane totally detached from reality You know in real life the space IS reality it s part of it It s not outside reality Why people think this is realistic after all that Maybe they already live an empty virtual life themselves Of course from this view the movie is hyper realistic Space is space nothing is nothing This movie is not about space but about nothing At all,1

13 October 2013,It's time to go home!,Gravity one of a best space movie ever produced Remember I am not comparing it to any space travel and alien themes Definitely it was this year s Life of Pi Easily one can put it into his her s all time favourite list There are very few breathtaking 3D movies I have seen in my life and it is one of them along side Avatar Hugo Life of Pi Probably you will miss something great if you miss this movie especially in digital 3D You will have whole life with you to see this movie at any time and day but watching it when it is served hot and spicy will be the best shot one can give So all I can say is don t miss this movie at any cost Okay lets talk about the movie and its storyline The story of this movie takes place approximately 600km above the Earth where astronauts sent to repair the Hubble space telescope During the final spacewalk Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock on her first space expedition accompanied by Matt Kowalski George Clooney gets a warn message from their mission control in Huston As that destroyed Russian satellite s scattered fragments are approaching them at very speed Soon after they loose contact from the control station in the Earth now they have to abort the mission and reach the safe place But it is too late for them and what comes after is the chain reaction of the destructed Russian satellite Sandra Bullock was very good as well looked so hot in off the astronaut costume There are no running dancing or any gun fights like that happen in space travel theme As it is happening in the space everything are floating and drifting so within that limited offer to give an actor to perform she did a wonderful performance George Clooney did not have much scope for his role within his limited time span he was as usual very nice It won t waste much time within starting few minutes the visuals makes you to feel you are in the space Since it takes place in space we know the objects floats in zero gravity so there are many visual pop ups Most importantly the intense pop ups are excluded like that happens in commercial movies everything are looked very natural like that happens in the space It was a great achievement cinematic to show the enormous space with most of them covered with dark background in 3D other than Earth s Yes with a dark background it is hard to see the depth of an object in 3D so the graphic designers did a wonderful job to make it work In some of the scenes the camera view transforming into a character s view which were something I never seen before surprisingly awesome It was a simple storied movie but a breathtaking stunts we were expecting all these years for it without knowing A little late but came at the right time when the graphics and 3D are beginning to boom the cinema world As you see it was not a rocket science to understand the movie but of course it was a bit about rockets and stuffs What I am saying is anyone can easily understand the movie it was not that complicated at all Even kids can enjoy it only if they are okay with loneliness distress kinda mild mind tortures This year s Oscar buzz begins with this movie what a way to begin I will be very sad if this movie won t get at least a single golden trophy in an upcoming Oscar ceremony I think I can expect nominations in the category of visual effects cinematography and best female lead for Sandra Bullock As well there is a strong chance that this movie could get into the top 10 for the best motion picture nominee list But still I don t how everything goes in the next couple of months because there are many great movies are in queue to hit the screen Such Oscar movies are 12 years of Slave and American Hustle I got a feeling that its big box office will impact a lot at the American Academy Awards If everything I said happens on that particular night I will have a little smile remembering this review I wrote As you see I might be a bit overwhelmed by a watch but I am sure this will be the best 90 minutes you will ever spend time for a movie in 2013 To encounter the real space atmosphere you must see the movie on a big screen as well in digital 3D Hope you will enjoy it more than I did or anyone around you 9 10,10
19 November 2013,Sets the standards for modern cinema,Gravity at first sight may appear to be an everyday space disaster film and you would be right Gravity follows a simple concept on and paper it may seem a bit tedious in fact However what highlights this film as one of the most cinematically perfect films ever made is not its story but its execution Visually Gravity is perfect The CGI is incredible and flawless to the eye It is very beautiful to admire especially in the opening 17 minute continuous shot which is designed to do nothing but make you admire and immerse yourself into the space scene During this continuous shot as you drift around George Clooney in the cosmos it is evident that Cuar n wants you to take a moment and enjoy this scene before it all goes to hell which it inevitably does The film is littered with stunning visuals through the times of calm everyday dialogue and terrifying scenes of peril Gravity pulls you in and throws you into the scene and with clever camera work even you sometimes forget you are sitting in your chair Gravity has been anticipated for its supposed realism Although according to the space pros its far off from being realistic the everyday film fan could not spot the flaws The realism in Gravity such as the lack of sound in space and the non existence of air creates an atmosphere that has never been experienced in film Watching a spacecraft get torn apart in total silence is like nothing you have ever seen How Gravity incorporates the idea of realism and the low hope of survival really makes you empathic for characters and vouch for their survival Gravity is almost cinematically perfect No question there Gravity exists to immerse entertain and to strike that fear that we all have in space back into us It creates visuals that have never been witnessed before and it is to date the best film to see in 3D The acting from Sandra Bullock is outstanding and she deserves credit and a lot of recognition for her role in this masterpiece along with George Clooney Gravity sets the standards for modern cinema and creates an experience that will be hard to beat in years to come 10 10,10
4 February 2014,One of the greatest movies I have seen,I just watched the film It s superb Definitely 10 10 The story is touching enlightening and inspiring the way it is People may want to add or remove pieces but I find it perfect the way it is told It is hard to write about it without revealing pieces that shouldn t be revealed Really What touched me the most is how this story speaks in a brilliant way about our lives our choices our greatest fears our attitude to life It touches you very deeply trust me on that And does so both strongly and gently The tension builds up then is released builds up and then is released What I love about Gravity is that it speaks very clearly and yet metaphorically It s not like somebody explaining you this or that not like the narrator speaks in the background telling you what to think It is like a made up example follows they beat somebody before your eyes and you know this is brutal the situation speaks for itself loudly and clearly there are no if s and no maybe s I don t like Hollywood movies in general because almost all of them are repetitive and boring It is very seldom I can stand a whole movie That however fully does not apply to Gravity It is great and will definitely evoke a response unless you are enlightened or hard asleep,10
3 March 2015,Visual Stunning,As many Oscar best picture nominated films and winners Gravity excels due to its technical aspect of the film Where in other places it does not it exceeds because of how visually stunning and memorizing the scenery is High quality global journalism requires investment Starring Sandra Bullock we see her as she gives us a calamity dame for a crisis bravery battling adversity hysteria and a fitfully firing backstory about a dead daughter Director and co writer Alfonso Cuar n a space novice self launched after a career in terrestrial drama and fantasy brings an innocent s freshness to the genre The 3D is most brilliantly unnerving when most seemingly trivial The weightless hazard objects that float past our faces in cabins a torch fork spanner mimic and prefigure the bigger bric a brac to come In the end we are witnessed to a more so predicable take but as it works for the best,7
22 November 2013,A phenomenal technological feat.,I went to see Gravity at the IMAX 3D and I was not disappointed The size of the screen coupled with the technologically magnificent use of the medium staggered me The use of occasional first person camera views and the 3D camera really put you in the shoes of the characters Although some might have found these scenes boring I found the broad sweeping views of space the utter silence and the sheer scale of everything a humbling experience The CGI creates a sense of reality as opposed to a world of imagination The basic premise of the film is two surviving astronauts after having their shuttle destroyed and being flung into space attempting to survive But it is not just floating around space the entire film it s a heart pounding thriller as the characters are faced with almost continuous danger throughout the film There is a fair amount of symbolism and philosophical subtext to a lot of the film much of it centered around rebirth and self realization Bullock and Clooney are portrayed as having hugely divergent reactions and outlooks to the crisis and on a deeper level life itself The debris could be viewed simply as just that debris It could be viewed as the tendency for humans to abdicate responsibility out of sight out of mind on a global scale but it is always at our detriment Or it could be viewed on a personally psychological level as things we push aside and avoid coming back to haunt us Gravity is hugely multifaceted as are it s characters and as such every viewer will view it and connect with the characters differently The script is very well written I highly recommend that you see this film in the full immersion experience of IMAX 3D so you can fully appreciate the wondrous cinematography But don t worry if that s not an option Gravity offers so much more Quite easily my favourite film of the year,9
18 August 2021,Short but intense,The movie is clearly short but have some very interesting visual A relationship between george clooney and sandra Bullox in space The movie contain dramatic moment Even with the original concept i clearly enjoy the movie until the end It was very good,7
13 November 2013,Fantastic Movie,This is a great movie Kind of a cross between Castaway and Apollo 13 Sandra Bullock is fantastic in this and I have to admit that George Clooney was getting on my nerves in the beginning because he once again was playing that playboy playful testosterone laced adolescent that he s so good at By the middle I decided that wasn t fair and actually thought he was fantastic in this and ended up wishing he was in it more But Sandra Bullock is the star Give that girl and Oscar Fantastic cinematography They ll win an Oscar for sure I liked the minimalist approach to this,9
21 February 2014,The Vidiot Reviews,Gravity In the 1960s women were only permitted to be astronauts so they could prepare their male counterpart s food tubes Fortunately times have changed and the lady astronaut in this thriller can now prepare tubeless meals With debris from a damaged satellite fast approaching the space walking occupants of the Explorer Lt Kowalski George Clooney and Dr Stone Sandra Bullock prepare for impact Unfortunately Stone is jettisoned from the shuttle during the high speed shower and set adrift in space with little oxygen and even less of a chance of surviving Her only hope lies in reaching a Chinese space station by way of a Russian module One of the most mind blowing movies about space what Gravity lacks in character development and overall story it makes up for in awe inspiring scenery and nerve racking tension Furthermore astronauts don t typically take space walks unless Chris Hadfield is strumming one of his folksy tunes again Green Light vidiotreviews blogspot ca,8
7 October 2013,Zzzzzzzzzzz,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
17 November 2013,The best film of 2013,GRAVITY is an incredible film It uses 3D to an amazing effect and I usually dismiss 3D as a gimmick The cinematography is spellbinding and you feel as if it was shot in space none the less feel like you are in space while watching it The special effects are incredible They are computerized but it does not seem computerized as it just looks like it has always been that way Acting from Sandra Bullock is just amazing and I think she will win another Oscar The script was great too Alfonso Cuaron has made an impeccable job of this film and it should be enjoyed by everyone who enjoys good films I hope that you will enjoy this film as much as i did,10
10 November 2013,"A great Out of the World, Action movie is Space,Do not Miss",Well made action movie and the best movie in 2013 CGI guys definitely deserves an Oscar For those sceptical Miss Bullock screams only for about 10 minutes in the movie and so relax George Clooney fools around for about 5 minutes and fits into the movie well thereafter We watched on IMAX 3D after travelling 50 miles and it was worth it for GREAT SOUND and HUGE Screen size for the out of the world space trip for 100 minutes AS it is not shot on IMAX cameras it does not have the full IMAX visual effect but the 3D on IMAX screen is good not excellent Highly recommended and I will not repeat the story highlighted by over 8000 others on this site Fantastic visual effects really mind blowing Don t watch on 2D please,10
13 October 2013,Groundbreaking and Mind Blowing Entertainment,I have to agree with James Cameron on this one gravity is definitely one of the best space movies ever made Alfonso Cuaron directs this movie so intense it felt like I there with the characters The acting was superb I think Sandra bullock should definitely get an Oscar for her performance as well as Alfonso for best director The CGI and cinematography were very well executed and how space was visualized is just beautiful and breathtaking I have to say this is probably one of the best movies done this year so far but that s just my opinion I had a great time watching this movie and I recommend this to anybody who enjoys good cinema,8
10 April 2020,Breath taking,This movie took my breath away and it is so beautiful the cinematography is amazing and the long takes are perfect,10
4 November 2019,borderline unwatchable if you know anything about space or spaceflight,I could only handle about 20 minutes of this movie before rolling my eyes so far back into my skull that i felt like i passed out It is STUPID as FUuCtionaKl I could not imagine how painful this was to do the cg for because it looks pretty good so just pouring all this work into this steaming pile of yikes movie was probably so taxing I could not get myself to watch this movie and I love space Guess I ll just go rewatch interstellar again,2
19 October 2013,"Visually stunning, story-wise underwhelming",I liked this film a lot The opening sequence was intense and the film kept up the visual drama from start to finish It did absolutely everything right in terms of technique angles shots composition lighting reflexions POV to pan everything technical was done well The story was okay and the characters were 2 dimensional and the story arc was terribly predictable I knew the entire plot from the moment that the astronauts radios announced that there was debris coming their way I knew the rest of the film s plot all the way until the final shot of the film which took a long time to get to I liked the film a lot though It is a masterpiece of editing and shooting and it s a reminder that film technology has reached a pinnacle and we can now use this technology to tell stories worth telling This story Could have used some work,8
4 October 2013,"""Clear, with a chance of satellite debris.""",Working in space is full of inherent dangers astronauts on a space walk are always in danger of being untethered and flung into open space to either drift eternally or fall to the Earth and burn up An astronaut could run out of air and suffocate If anything happens to the EVA suit an astronaut could decompress There s always the threat that random debris orbiting the planet could strike an astronaut and end his life very suddenly Space is too wide open to have any margin of error the film Gravity even starts with the statement that it is impossible for life to exist in space Some films have touched upon the dangers of space here and there but of all the space movies out there Gravity is easily the most earnest attempt to make a plausible and creditable thrill ride out of showing astronauts in peril The film is simple and minimalistic using only two main characters and a simple situation to make them struggle for their lives As the astronauts suffer a tragic space accident and are forced to use their limited air and resources to find a way back to Earth the film tracks their every move and focuses on all the dangers and problems they face What makes the film great is that there is always a new problem to face it s not just 90 minutes of floating in space it s a survivalist story that smoothly progresses from one thing to another Despite the perils on display the film also showcases some gorgeous imagery showing vast views of Earth from orbit with city lights clouds and auroras clearly visible along the planet s surface Some of the most jaw dropping sequences however show a silently violent storm of debris that rips through space shuttles and space stations obliterating them into thousands of pieces of debris The experience overall is visually marvelous and tensely gripping The story is as minimal as it can be the plot is solely devoted to the survival story with the astronauts drifting from one target to another to try and reach home Characters are colorful and likable but aren t really explored in depth The simplicity of the story however is part of what makes it great the film takes its time to breathe and let the experience take precedence Part of what makes the film work however is its cameramanship which is extraordinary As an evolution of the prolonged shots used in Children of Men Gravity has many sequences where the camera always moves and tracks the action without cutting The opening sequence in particular must have run for ten minutes or so without a single cut The camera swings around and swoops through space to replicate the effect of actually being in space and it does so without being erratic or annoying the imagery is always smooth and flowing As such the editing is ingenious Acting is pretty decent Sandra Bullock is surprisingly earnest in this role and I believe this may be the best of her career for she plays a character that we love to root for and is not all that goofy either George Clooney is pretty much himself Writing is very good This production uses very real looking sets props costumes and marvelous special effects The film also uses a very interesting soundscape because there is no air in space the film keeps actual sound effects to a minimum but it fills the void with the dialogue and with Steven Price s enchanting music score Astronaut movies are few and far between as they are the only other good contenders I know of would be The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 and I daresay Space Cowboys As it is Gravity is my new favorite among space movies for it presents a fundamental story in a creditably fashion with superb skill and craftsmanship Recommended 5 5 Experience Perfect Story Good Film Perfect,10
5 March 2022,Just ok,I didn t love this movie and I didn t hate this movie It was just okay for me Some of the sequences were edge of your seat kind of thrilling and then other times the story kind of drags I didn t feel very satisfied when the movie was over,7
23 October 2013,Best Film Since Avatar!,It would be wrong to mention anything about the plot beyond what is revealed in the trailers I will just say that they should start lining up the Oscars I see nominations for best film best actress maybe best supporting actor best special effects best cinematography best sound best score best editing and a special Oscar for the system devised to create the amazing images I probably left some out Quite simply this is the best film since Avatar Like Avatar it combines excellent acting with a great story and amazing special effects The result is an experience that is moving on a visceral level and also inspiring I saw Gravity on IMAX in 3D but I think it would be great with any system This is what cinema is all about,10
24 November 2013,A dazzling achievement,In Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity Matt Kowalski George Clooney and Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock are space walking astronauts on a routine mission to introduce a new technology into the systems of the Hubble telescope Stone is on her first mission and Kowalski on his last and his matter of fact wisecracking humor sharply contrasts with Stone s studious solidity Things change rapidly from order to chaos however when an off course Russian missile destroys a satellite and releases a shower of shrapnel into orbit hurtling in the direction of their shuttle Stone and Kowalski are the mission s only survivors left spinning helplessly in space after their shuttle is destroyed When contact with home is broken they keep talking to whoever is out there listening to themselves hoping to be heard We are with them in space with the sun drenched image of the Earth always present thanks to the breathtaking cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki Tethered together floating 600 kilometers above the Earth with their oxygen running dangerously low the only option for them is to make their way to a capsule on either the International Space Station or a smaller Chinese orbiting platform to find an escape pod to take them home Along the way Dr Stone has to deal with fires extreme temperatures mechanical failures and language barriers just to stay afloat Demoralized by a tragic incident in her life that has left her feeling that life is simply a random throw of the dice Stone must call upon reservoirs of strength she had not known she possessed to transcend the barriers that stand in her way For her getting home requires the courage to let go of her attachments and experience herself newly to see her life as birth and rebirth Although the personal drama feels calculated Gravity is a dazzling achievement and one that hopefully may begin to lead us away from seeing the universe in terms of our fears to one of a deeper reverence for its mystery and beauty Without doubt it is a film about surviving and reaching one s goal yet more than that it is about learning to appreciate the ride,8
23 October 2013,The Physics ruined it for me...,If Oscars were being handed out for movies being intense then Gravity would get the award and then some Many of the moments throughout the movie were intense for the viewer and there was always a sense of peril that cast a long shadow over what was going on and in all circumstances with the exception of the finale the outcome was catastrophic I was barely able to breathe I was having difficulty holding on to my chair and digesting the material as it was being delivered This is Hollywood and because of the 174 919 886 domestic total boxofficemojo com 10 23 2013 10 01 PM MST as well as general critical response there exists a sentiment of a job well done But for me being the harsh sci fi critic that I am I have to grade fairly and there were quite a few things that I saw that I stand resolved on they were just not right First there is a scene when Ryan is talking into a radio blindly trying to send a message to mission control where the camera is clearly set in space looking into her capsule and we still hear the muffled voice of Ryan as though she were sitting in a chamber that was not within a vacuum In a vacuum even if your ear is pressed up against the module and someone on the inside is speaking you won t hear a muffled voice or anything for that matter because there is no atmosphere in space there is no medium for sound to travel in Next I thought it was a difficult pill to swallow when Matt Kowalski unhooked himself from the tether that was connected to Ryan there was a physical system in play here and the system was at rest Because they were in space and neither person was moving and no objects were exerting force on either object and because there could be no inertia in a system at rest in an environment without gravity there could be no force pushing Matt Kowalski away from Ryan Stone all Matt had to do was tug at the tether and he would have traveled toward the space station Were these people really astronauts My next issue was that I thought it was strangely convenient that the space shuttle Explorer was conveniently close enough to the international space station to make a spacewalk using a thruster pack look like a walk in the park Kowalski had to use the packs power during their spacewalk which was almost at an end before tragedy struck he had to use the packs power again to rescue Ryan Stone again to get back to the destroyed space shuttle and again to get to the space station I cannot begin to imagine what 29th century technology had been used to create this device or what Marvin the Martian cartoon it came from The debris field that orbits the earth every 90 minutes was also something that I took issue with Please reference the 7 49 through the 10 00 minute marks in How the Universe Works Netflix Season 1 episode 7 Alien Solar Systems Here we see that a process called accretion with a recorded experiment at the real ISS test environment accounts for the construction of planetary bodies This process starts small and takes a long time Dust particles and rocks and other debris that collide end up sticking together and do not fly apart or through objects as they do in Gravity So when the debris hits the shuttle or the space station or the telescope or astronauts while potentially damaging would not fly through it as we could see from when Matt and Ryan are looking at their dead spacewalker friends head and seeing the Earth below This bothered the hell out of me My next issue was that Dr Ryan Stone did not seem to be a genuine character to me She was talking blindly to mission control and giving her go big or go home speech and I was simply not convinced or impressed I think she was trying to be emotional and trying to look flustered but at the same time she gave the impression that she knew she was making a film and contending for an award and seemed to be overacting I also think I figured out why they are claiming that this film is science fiction and I think it is inflammatory The Chinese Space station that Ryan was able to eventually escape to does not yet exist and won t be built until the year 2020 source en wikipedia org wiki Chinese space station It is my opinion that the existence of this space station indicates that the film is not contemporary but slightly in the future and that indeed means that this is sci fi i e speculative existence of this space station This of course flies in the face of all the inaccuracies with regards to physics and how special bodies behave when they collide this also requires suspension of disbelief and is fantastic and therefore could potentially also qualify this film as sci fi While I do overlook some inaccuracies in sci fi movies most notably the sounds that ships make when they are flying through the vacuum of space because this is generally not critical to plot or story there were too many issues here The issues with physics were I think critical to plot and progression of the story and the inaccuracies ruined the experience for me I apologize to everyone who liked this film I think that it is great that such a work is considered by so many to be moving and intense but unfortunately this movie will get no high marks from me I want science fiction that is grounded in current human progression of a physical understanding of the universe Cuar n would have done well to study up before he made this movie if he wanted universal appreciation from everyone SciFiMan,1
25 October 2013,Gravity is a Knock Out Sci-Fi Thriller,Less is more Well okay almost always less is more This is true for the 2013 film Gravity An astronaut a medical engineer a handful of extras a broke down space shuttle and a couple of air crafts leave viewers on the edge of their seats as Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock must contrive and scheme in order to launch herself from space back to earth I effing hate space says Dr Stone after a mess of debris forces Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney to detach themselves from a space shuttle to escape death Stone is pulled away from the space shuttle by gravity Her radio the only source of communication cuts in and out throwing Stone into a panic attack which gobbles up her oxygen Just when we think gravity might take over Kowalski finds her afloat and brings her back to base There s no such thing as home base in space especially when the space shuttle and the handful of extras are found dead With limited oxygen Kowalski and Stone make it to another air craft A cord wraps around Stone s foot causing a major catastrophe As the plot progresses in this Science Fiction thriller the same rope that once saves Stone s life threatens it Trying to escape a catastrophic fire Stone cleverly rides a fire extinguisher like a heat seeking missile from one space craft to another Just when you think she might be safe to return to earth another crisis erupts And the climatic approach throughout Gravity lasts until the very end when you as the viewer realize that after watching Gravity a vacation from life is in order Gravity is an epic force of nature It s much like Danny Boyle s 2010 127 Hours James Franco s character Aron Rolston is biking through a canyon and falls victim to a boulder in the smallest possible crack in the earth Rolston resorts to desperate measures in order to survive Both Gravity and 127 Hours have simplistic story lines but are filled with action adventure scenarios in which the audience is left with the Oh My God expression I watch with such intensity only to be left with an exasperation of relief at the very end When a plot is centered around a person as the protagonist and mother nature as the antagonist 99 percent of the time mother nature wins What happens to those who are clumped in the one percent tile I ll tell you It drives an original masterpiece into the stratosphere begging in 55 8 million opening weekend and ranking Gravity as the number one film in the world,10
12 July 2014,An experience over story,Gravity is one of those movies you regret not seeing in the biggest theater possible The way it looks how the camera moves around the angles they go with the special effects the whole visual package is just phenomenal to look at Easily one of the most impressive films in a while when it comes to the whole moving pictures aspect Gravity keeps things simple and focuses on the essentials It is meant to be an experience rather than a statement of something profound That doesn t mean there isn t a story or even a point to be found within it but they are both secondary to the vision Kind of like a Nirvana song There are lyrics but the music came first And what music or visuals in this case it is Gravity steals your breath away from the very first scene with a long establishing shot where the camera simple circles around the space station from one astronaut to another without a single cut to be seen Amazingly beautiful which the rest of the movie easily keeps up until the very end I m also impressed how full they managed to make the space look This could have simply been white human blobs floating against the darkness of vacuum but through good angles and orbital location they manage to make it look better than that The rest of the aspects work very well as well The absence of sound in space is utilized well and the actors are all at the top of their game Though to be fair whereas Sandra Bullock completely submerges herself into the role of Ryan Stone giving a very impressive performance with George Clooney I always saw only George Clooney in space Still a good performance though Gravity will pull you into an unforgettable journey and is one of the most ambitious and impressive scifi films to come out in years Definitely worth checking out,7
9 January 2015,Waste of Time,Last night wife and I viewed this on free HBO weekend and am I glad we did not rent this one We are movie TV watchers and I truly do not get therating of 8 0 listed on IMDb Usually the ratings are very good and we always check first before wasting our precious time This was the worst boring movie and the only redeeming moment was when Sandra Bullock took off her suit and my wife said nice body but the short shorts really Again we had to fast forward due to being so boring My wife said good character study and I thought is she high There was really NO surprises in dialog at all and the end was a real dud Again the IMDb ratings are usually right on but the audience really missed this one,1
13 December 2013,Visually spectacular... but that's it.,This film is over hyped I m not saying it s poor I just think it s not as good as you re led to believe First the good things Visually it s one of the most stunning things I ve ever seen you have to see this in 3D it s the ultimate 3D movie as they re in space and everything is floating all the time and it s simply stunning The director did an exceptional job you really feel as if you are in space The clever switches from third to first person is excellent and I have to commend this especially with the 3D I really can t stress how much of a stunning spectacle it is NOW HERE S THE PROBLEM The stunning visuals mask a poor and unrealistic storyline The characters are predictable and some of their actions are baffling and the ending is just utterly predictable I don t want to spoil the film but I just couldn t relate to the storyline 3D VISUALS 9 8 10 Storyline 3 6 10 to conclude it s a wonderful spectacle and the 3D is so stunning it allows you to zone out of the boring storyline but this is a film I will never watch in 2D If you want one of the most spectacular visuals ever this is it If you want a good film that forces you to think then don t waste your money,6
4 October 2013,A masterpiece without no doubt.,Before this I only watched two films that was directed by Alfonso Cuar n One which is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the second is Children of Men Both of these films especially Children of Men is really one of the great cinematic masterpieces made by Alfonso Cuar n The only films that I ve seen he produced is his collaborations with Guillermo del Toro s Pan s Labyrinth Pan s Labyrinth was also a great films with stunning visuals and story Nevertheless what Alfonso Cuar n produced is not important here It is the direction and writing from Alfonso Cuar n and Jon s Cuar n that what makes me loves Gravity By only seeing his two films I can honestly say that I loves Alfonso Cuar n films I knew Gravity back when I saw the poster at my local cinema Immediately I saw Alfonso Cuar n name on it After that I watched the trailer and I am impressed with the visuals shown in it To be honest the less you know about the film the better The film starts out by showing fantastic view of the world accompanying with the dazzling score made by Steven Price In the intro comes Dr Ryan Stone who is played by Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski who is played by the handsome George Clooney Both of them including the third astronaut who s an Indian played by Paul Sharma are on to do their duty Here film also shown a glimpse of graphic violence which prove a bit unsettling for some viewers The films starts to build up the suspense and thrills when the debris from a satellite crashes into the space shuttle Explorer destroying most of it and leaving them stranded in space with limited air A moment of silence used in the films is also spot on Every moment of silence in the film is well used I also noticed there s a plenty of continuous shot used in Gravity From moment to another moment most of the shot used by Alfonso Cuaron is a long and continuous shot That kind of shot is what makes Gravity more authentic and breathtaking The view of the world from the space is just simply astonishing Scene after scene shows the hardness of survival from the aftermath of the debris that hit them George Clooney performance is well enough to be mention as well as showing the funny element in the film As for Sandra Bullock her performance is great She shows the emotions and acts to survive Her struggle determination and persistent is what best to describe her performance in the Gravity The plot in the film itself is not that deep and it is more straight forward but in the mean time this does not mean the film story is not good Gravity is one of the most well crafted film made by an impressive filmmaker The film stunning visual should be credited to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki in which it keeps me attached to my seat right along with the astronauts Gravity is the closest we will ever get to the real deal of being in the deep space The physics shown in Gravity makes you realize that this film is very hard to make and we can see there s a lot of effort is put to make the film The only flaw this film had is just a small bit which is on the ending But I don t want to spoil anything here Overall Gravity is one of the most impressive visual films I ve seen so far this year If you are a fan of space drama such as Moon or Sunshine or Kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey you ll love Gravity The build up of the suspense the thrills the emotions shown and the scores is what makes Gravity one of the best films in this year for me The authenticity in the movie is just top notch In the end Gravity shows that in life we need gravity It is vital as we re humans need it just like air to breath Oxygen and gravity is the science elements of life that we need to prosper In Gravity itself shows there s a lot of message in it It is showing to us that gravity is an essential part in life in order to live To conclude Gravity is one of the great films I ve seen so far this year If you like sci fi and space drama with an exceptional visual and great acting plus great story give Gravity a try It should be appreciate as a great masterpiece without a doubt Credit should be given to Alfonso Cuaron because of his direction Sandra Bullock for her strong performances Emmanuel Lubezki for the stunning cinematography in the film and also the rest of the crew,9
23 October 2013,One of the best sci-fie movie and even realistic,This is one of the best movie of 2013 first of all Sandra Bullock George Clooney both are awesome throughout the whole movie First time i have watched a movie of Sandra Bullock and she acted really well Its a kind of movie to watch on a big screen otherwise you really gonna miss the whole experiences Alfonso Cuar n is really a great director He really made it so fascinating He really tried to take care of all those small things which is pretty much important in such kind of movies He is really a very good director there s no doubt in it I really like to write a lot about this movie but i don t wanna make it boring THE ONLY THING I WANT TO SAY IS GO AND WATCH IT YOU REALLY GONNA LIKE IT GUARANTEED ENJOY,10
26 March 2014,"Serious cinema lovers, believe the hype!",I love that famous Einstein s quote about nationalism being a child s disease for humanity So I m not writing this because I m a Mexican but for I like good films plain and simple I ve read many critics about this movie being overrated But they come always to the same concepts it seems to me like people in the USA wants a sic fi movie to be either a clich blockbuster commonplace go America kind of crap or being a documentary art film OK script and dialogs are not the best I ll give you that This is not a 2001 like philosophical film either But come on unrealistic story So Armageddon The 5th element Total recall and the like are better at that Sandra Bullock air grasping bother you I guess she could better be tossing patriotic lines or epiphany insights right Do you find less than believable that someone crashing at 3 m s don t kill them Wanna dwell a little bit in Newtonian 0G physics I thought so No you ll not be hearing some mad wrestler voice impersonations or speed twisting action scenes Matrix or crash and flame environment sounds because well this is space Go find a Bruce Willis Marvel film for that Or some of that damn virtual video game like films 300 What you will DO find is a very subtle subplot of rebirth A film in which technology supports the plot not blurring or overriding it Its a very fine film A British film directed by a Mexican Don t spect blockbuster gringo clich s,9
22 May 2014,Excellent out-of-this-world adventure,GRAVITY in my opinion is an excellent out of this world adventure I thought that the special effects were eye popping the outer space setting was spectacular and the whole production design was good looking When Ryan Sandra Bullock couldn t get in touch with anyone I got a little bit scared This was because I didn t want anything bad to happen to her and Matt George Clooney This was especially true whenever they floated away with a whoosh Before I wrap this up I d like to say that Warner Brother has scored again Now in conclusion I highly recommend this excellent out of this world adventure to any Sandra Bullock or George Clooney fan who hasn t seen it You re in for a real treat so rent it or buy it kick back with someone and see it today,9
12 October 2015,Grossly over-rated due to poor script,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,4

29 December 2013,Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris,Gripping space thriller about two astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock on her first space shuttle mission and Matt Kowalsky George Clooney on his last who have to fight to survive after an accident sets them adrift in space Visually stunning film that is obviously best seen in 3D Trust me I m not big on 3D and see it for the price gouging gimmick it usually is However this is one film where the viewing experience is actually enhanced by it The story is simple So simple that it s the type of movie that really depends on its leads more than usual to keep it interesting But they do deliver Sandra Bullock is excellent though admittedly the role does play to her strengths Clooney plays Clooney likable and stoic We re told this is his character s last space flight before retiring If you ve seen any cop movie ever you know there s not a bigger bullseye to have painted on your back than being on the verge of retirement It s a good movie A little over hyped but these days every moderately good film is over hyped unfortunately Try not to let that prevent you from trying it You d be missing out on a solid movie if you did,7
6 April 2014,Yet another opportunity lost to great visuals,I believe we ve reached a point where special effects are so amazing in their look and feel that we are losing sight of the power of characters and stories Gravity is the perfect example of this The visuals are actually emotional and powerful and the necessary setting for such a story But they should not be what truly move us Gravity lacks so much of what many of the great science fiction writers provided us with the chance to see events that have not happened but could and the effects on human beings beyond the obvious fear and panic Ray Bradbury s incredible Kaleidoscope of course is the standard by which any lost in space story is measured No doubt the intent was to show only Stone s experiences from her point of view but it would have been interesting to see Kowalski s journey and thoughts Another problem with Gravity in my opinion is the obvious references to Alien 2001 and other science fiction films And it seems totally ridiculous to take off your space suit when the danger of a lack of oxygen or pressure is everywhere But we all know why that happened I m positive that the brave astronauts in our space program have always been the best of us without being perfect Their skills courage and inspirational lives are what I wanted Gravity to capture Instead it seems to either trivialize their quality or distort it depending on the particular scene The courage to fear ratio is definitely off in Gravity and the character s reflections and conversations are irritatingly shallow So many lost chances to explore events which our astronauts have always had to deal with potentially I was very disappointed in this film for that reason above all else,2
18 November 2013,Bought me down to earth,I m not sure that I saw the same version of Gravity as everyone else who seem to be raving about it A plot that is minimal a mawkish sub plot that adds sod all a couple of performances that were phoned in by Bullock and Clooney a bombastic score and some pretty 3D skyscapes The plot devices intended to create drama become tiresome the characters are thinner than the atmosphere and whilst some of the visuals are good they re certainly not the greatest I ve ever seen We both walked out at the end and agreed that we d both found it disappointing Shame really as I expected so much more,5
30 October 2013,Gravity proves why someone has to go to the theater and experience a film and not just watch it...,Alfonso Cuar n has done it again We have seen thrills in water we have experienced chills in snow and air Now you will be at the edge of your seat when you see Sandra Bullock drifting in space Gravity is a movie about Matt Kowalski George Clooney and Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock One is an astronaut and the other an engineer working for NASA The excitement starts right from the word go where we see Matt spacewalking Soon the Hubble Space Telescope Mission Control in Houston confirms that Space debris from a Russian satellite has caused a chain reaction of destruction and they were instructed to abort the mission The debris struck them before they could take any action killing all the crew members except Matt and Ryan Ryan was drifting in the space when Matt rescued her and tethered her to him so that they can move together While they were moving the oxygen level of Ryan was decreasing They planned to go the ISS International Space Station In the way we get to know that Ryan s daughter died in an accident and Matt motivating her that they would survive As they approached ISS they see that the crew has already left it with the Soyuz Matt suggests that they could use the remaining Soyuz to go to the Chinese space station and use their Soyuz to go back to Earth While they were approaching the ISS the debris storm strikes again where Matt had to sacrifice himself to save Ryan Ryan goes to the Chinese station after a lot of hick ups and manages to survive and return back to Earth As the movie progresses the excitement increases Brilliantly shot movie with a power packed performance by Sandra Bullock Great camera work to show incredible pictures of earth at night and the sunrise Alfonso Cuar n s direction has proved gold in the past He has shown the ultimate road trip Y tu mama tambien the fantasy world of Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and a brilliant science fiction Children of Men Don t watch this movie in DVD or download it Go to a theater get a 3D glass and experience space Where 2001 A Space Odyssey talked about evolution I think Stanley Kubrick had the power to see the future and he saw Gravity coming,9

4 October 2013,Movie Review: Gravity is an excellent 3D thrill ride,DIRECTION The first thing to know about Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity is that it s not just a visual spectacle but it s an interesting character piece as well However it s the visual style here that places this movie among some of the best we ve ever seen It s the best 3D movie since Avatar and you can tell he s been working on this for years Many shots specifically rely on the 3D effect to give you the trill ride Cuar n is looking for and it s incredibly effective The aesthetic is the best I ve ever seen for a space movie and is one of the more realistic one s you ll encounter to date You really feel like you re in space floating around and experiencing something you never have before The camera almost operates as it s floating around too It circles often turns in various ways and it very specific to show you depth and the different ranges of space The visuals of earth and the sun are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking This is easily the best visual effects in quite some time and easily the best of 2013 Buckle up and enjoy the ride Grade A SCRIPT The story is pretty simple on the surface Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer and is teamed up with astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney who are working on a new project up in space in lower Earth orbit when disaster strikes It s a simple survivor story right Wrong They both become adrift in space and now have to team up to survive and figure out how to get back home Throughout the struggle we find out that Stone has some bad heartache and is still learning to grieve and let go of her pain Yet Kowalski is a fun loving guy looking to break some space records but ultimately knows what to do in order to survive Once you start digging beneath the surface Gravity speaks to amazing concepts of struggle and the fight to survive This is especially difficult when you don t have anything to live for but when you find that reason it s not about just getting by but living each moment like it s your last Sure some parts of the script rely on coincidences and luck but those moments are forgivable and small in the big picture of things Grade A PERFORMANCES Sandra Bullock can be hit or miss depending on who you ask but in Gravity she s a homerun Regardless of what you think about Bullock she does drama well and as a character who is traumatized in life and now the situation she faces Bullock shines Her character has depth and she brings a lot of emotion to her which is incredibly effective You fall for her character and the struggle that she s in both as a person and the situation To me this is Sandra Bullock s best role she s ever done George Clooney has less screen time than expected but is also very good He s the jokster fun loving astronaut that has a lot of stories to tell He s also smart and comes across very engaging Clooney doesn t have as much to do but is really good for what his character calls for And you have to love the Ed Harris cameo He was amazing in Apollo 13 as the NASA commander and is back in Houston as the voice that communicates back to our struggling astronauts Grade A SCORE This is by far Steven Price s best score He was great in The World s End but his score not only is effective here but it s a critical piece to the film This movie calls for emotion and is a huge spectacle and Price s score reflects that beautifully He uses a lot of strings mixed with digital music and even some voice work It s a good listen outside of the film and is perfect for what this film needed Grade A FINAL THOUGHTS Gravity is a movie you want to see in 3D In fact go to the biggest IMAX 3D screen you can find The visuals are absolutely stunning and gives you the best 3D thrill ride you ve seen in a long time The performances shine and you feel like you re a part of the action in space If you want to know what it s like in space without ever going there watch this movie It s absolutely incredible Overall Grade A,10

27 October 2013,As amazing as it's possible,If you still don t watch it and if you are still on time go to the theaters right now this is a rare opportunity to experience an a cinematographic marvel In all the technological aspects for the making of this movie there was a huge creative processes otherwise wouldn t be possible bring to life this astonishing film not only visually but in every way that a simple movie can do Alfonso Cuaron writing and directing in his best some times or the most of the times a great movie like this when seems easy and correct is harder to create a creative mind needs to start in blank and think in all that little pieces that will complete the big masterpiece so at the end you can say it looks as it suppose to do it looks REAL The story and plot is a nonstop of suspense drama which doesn t need to go so far in time or space all this happens in the dark void of our present with the beautiful background of the earth and all the philosophical thoughts of being alone detached of all things this performed flawless by his 2 talented protagonists George Clooney and the hot and beautiful Sandra Bullock Children of Men was my favorite Cuar n s work but Gravity goes beyond i just hope to see Alfonso Cuar n more into Sci Fi movies like this 2 It seems limited just have a rate from 1 to 10 and if i don t put 10 to this movie i would have to move down almost all the other movies on my rate list,8
4 October 2013,Kafka in space,this space drama no it s not a sci fi movie is beyond words you feel like as being put in a shuttle this movie pulls you directly into the dark and mute space you feel the fear you breath the loneliness you hear the silence the acting is superb and so are the cgi it s awesome and mind blowing Both Clooney and Bullock put on a great show in Gravity With Sandra Bullock actually putting on an acting clinic at times that I for one never gave her credit for in the past Without spoiling the movie for anyone I will tell you that these two are the only people you see on screen with the rest of the very short cast list appearing in voice form only the director Alfonso Caron once proofs again that he is one of the smartest guys in Hollywood i had really no expectations but believe me after this space classic you will look differently to the sky,10

11 October 2013,Right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solyaris,Gravity manages to transcend the realm of film and leave you mesmerized with its fierce suspense and jaw dropping special effects The film employs only two actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock but it manages to say so much with so little Majority of the screen time belongs to Sandra Bullock s character Ryan who played out her role with perfection She finally got a role which did her acting prowess justice and I could not see anyone else doing a better job than her in that role Clooney with his usual flair plays out the outspoken Kowalski character to utmost precision The role seemed to be sculpted for him Cuaron s direction is masterful The opening sequence itself is a 10 minute shot without any cuts and there are numerous other long shots in the film That must have been really difficult to produce The sound mixing in this one is fascinating The sound mixing in itself managed to take the film to a different level altogether The minimalistic background music is mixed right into the film which is absolutely brilliant Sometimes the intermittent silences spoke more than the background music and it is also the best 3D film ever made and it wins by a long margin The 3D managed to physically affect the audience and it is not used only as a gimmick but adds on the overall experience The only thing on my mind when I left the theater was when will I again get a chance to go back inside to view this spectacle Hats off,10

15 December 2013,Typical George Clooney movie.,Actually quite a disappointment It would be wonderful I suspect in 3D and it may well win an Oscar for special effects Otherwise the film is clich It is a movie with two characters and the performances of both are routine and expected There is some highfalutin intent on the producer s part about the meaning of the whole episode but that is well hidden by the dialog The Clooney portion of the script is very breezy In the opening sequence he flits mechanically around the outside of the space craft in an effort to break a Russian s record for untethered floating around in space It adds nothing to the dramatic tension if ever there was any Stone s portion of the script is an endless series of pants She never seems to catch her breath which becomes annoying This film is for someone else to enjoy,4
14 October 2013,Spectacular!,This is possibly one of the most amazing movies of this decade Not only does it have a compelling story line and no I didn t think it was slow but from a technology point of view the most amazing use of IMAX and 3 D technologies ever And if Sandra Bullock doesn t get an Acadamy nod for her performance I ll be even more surprised than when Barbara Streisand didn t get a nod for The Mirror Has Two Faces The only reason I didn t give it 10 stars is that there were a couple of technical goofs but really that is a mere quibble Even knowing they existed didn t affect my suspension of disbelief one iota It is the closest most of us will ever come to experiencing space,9
19 November 2013,3D has finally been given a purpose!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
7 October 2013,"Pure Hollywood Magic, What an Incredible Movie",just got back from seeing this movie and it truly was an experience to behold see it in IMAX if you can I think 3D is a must though I haven t seen it 2D so I cant compare other than the fact that distances in this movie are very important and 3D delivers on that end It truly gives you a sense of desperation in a very realistic way I found myself gasping for air in some scenes and that really about says it all you re right there with them you feel it and at just 90 minutes long you feel like the movie is much longer but in a good way in that it transports you to space and makes you feel at least part of the helplessness and desperation that they are feeling will not give any details about the movie because you all pretty much know from the trailer what the plot is pretty straight forward plot I do agree with another reviewer s opinion that Sandra Bullock should get another Oscar for this and maybe its the source material but no one so far this year has taken their acting to this level the people behind me were crying in several scenes I almost did Sandra has truly come along way since Demolition Man,10
9 December 2013,Hands Down The Best Movie of the Year; Gravity puts you on your feet,There are few films like Gravity that are able to consume you and utilize the entire running time to the full extent of their ability From start to finish it keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next The script is simplistic It is purely about human survival and how our will to live is so much more powerful than we could ever imagine Throughout the entire film Bullock s performance never waivers It is the best she s ever been and she has the power to move you to tears The film places you in the position of her character and makes you feel as though you are in space along for the ride The visual effects will fool you so well you ll think you were just transported to space for an hour and a half The sound design perfectly ads the tension and fear that is pushing you to the edge of your seat All these elements combined make for one considerable directorial monument for Alfonso Cuar n Gravity is one hell of a roller coaster ride that deserves no beckons to be seen in 3D on the largest screen possible There is no other way to do this masterpiece justice,10

25 October 2013,"Technically very flawed, quite boring and silly",Lousy film Why Full of technical faults and silliness I won t spoil the film but anyone who knows anything about space and the atmosphere will know this film is rubbish There were far too many ridiculous scenes in the film The story was thin It had full on effects but was technically weak I found it boring It it more suitable for the cheap thrills American market but not suitable for those who want to engage in a deep and meaningful film I felt I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this garbage The fact the ignorant clown sitting in the seat next to me at the cinema took the entire film getting on my nerves drinking his slurpee and feeding his fat face with junk food he did not influence the 2 10 I gave this film The fact this film has received such a high rating beggars belief If you want a good film don t waste your time with this If you want some cheap thrills then this might be for you but watch out for any imbeciles sitting in the seats near you,2
4 August 2014,laws of physics need not apply!!!,I really thought this was going to be good but almost as soon as it started the laws of physics ended You can only stretch the truth so far before it becomes a total joke The acting was very much less than stellar by these two main characters But it s the mistakes many many many of them that made me lose interest first I started to think maybe this was just a low budget project a friend of one of the actors talked them into doing until I saw the movie budget of ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS That s an awful big mistake Honestly I can t think of one thing about this movie that was factually accurate or that interested me enough to recommend it It s just that bad If you live in Co or Ca Where people are perpetually high it might be entertaining but if you re sober or have any brain cells left pass on this one,2
22 June 2016,Gravity's nonstop action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seats and guessing up until the end on how the movie ends (No Spoilers Here),After the National Geographic s Live In Space broadcast the American astronaut revealed he watched the space thriller Gravity while whizzing around in space on the International Space Station While the astronauts made the comparison to that of passengers on a cruise ship watching the Titanic it has garnered renewed interest in the film which at the time of the broadcast had recently came out on DVD On Demand and on iTunes two weeks prior Gravity winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Director is a fictional account of a disaster in space with most of the physics of space and micro gravity correctly portrayed Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer on her first Space Shuttle mission with only six months of training to install her own updates to the Hubble Space Telescope for her research George Clooney plays veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski who is on his last space mission and is attempting to break the record for space walking using a prototype jetpack And Ed Harris is the voice of mission control What seems to be the start of a routine spacewalk disaster strikes 10 minutes into this 91 minute film with 81 minutes of non stop edge of your seat drama that keeps building until a the climax at the end allows you to breath again But only in the last 30 seconds of the film Every time I watch this film I swear the movie is only 60 minutes That s how fast the action moves through the entire length The drama starts when Stone is working on the Hubble when the Russians shoot down one of their own obsolete satellites with a land based missile seven minutes into the film Without spoiling the film the space shuttle is destroyed leaving Stone and Kowalski alone in the deafening silence of space alone and tethered to only each other as they fly into the darkness of space After loosing the last lifeline they have communications to Mission Control the drama heats up as Stone and Kowalski have lost any chance of rescue Or have they Fear turns into panic as they gulp down oxygen like it was a cold drink on a scorching hot day adding to the growing list of problems with no solutions in sight Stone and Kowalski realize that they must go deeper into the dark abyss of space to throw a Hail Mary that makes the one Doug Flutie threw in 1984 look like a routine shuttle pass Gravity directed by Mexican born Alfonso Cuar n who also produced edited and co wrote the screenplay with his son Jon s Cuar n George Clooney was uncredited as collaborating in writing the screenplay This is the first project that the father son team worked on together as directors but not their first movie project Gravity for the most part is accurate in its portrayal of space However the sound effects people couldn t leave well enough alone They broke some of the laws of physics such as when the added sound to scenes where objects collided in space Remember as the film s opening says there is no sound in space You can hear some of the sounds while the music tries to cover it up Also anyone who knows something about space will see that at times an action does not always have an opposite and equal reaction As an amateur astronomer since 1973 I could pick this film apart However any of the small breaking of the laws of physics will not interfere with the non stop thriller making you feel good about having both feet on Earth However some of the best commentary on the film came from American Astronaut Rick Mastracchio during the live broadcast from the ISS during the NatGeo broadcast Mastracchio said that while such a disaster like the one portrayed in Gravity may be possible nothing like that has ever happened in space There have been near disasters in space while aboard the Space Shuttle and the ISS excluding the Challenger and Columbia disasters For those who have yet to watch Live In Space there will be no spoilers given by the astronauts here either other than that the incidents that did happen and discussed during the live broadcast could have been as equally deadly to the ISS as in Gravity While the ISS is the most heavily fortified object in space capable of withstanding strikes from small objects and micro meteors it is also protected by a virtual box that NORAD monitors If an object enters this box the first call goes to NASA and the ISS has the capability to blast itself away from any danger All I will say is that this call has been made to NASA on more than one occasion In addition to Gravity the father son duo produced the 2004 hit movie The Assassination of Richard Nixon starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts If you love space movies Gravity provides much realism with a backdrop taken from NASA archives and a storyline that will keep you on edge and guessing It s dramatic impact is non stop and the 91 minute film flies as fast as the ISS does through space This is a movie that should be in everyone s collection,9

15 October 2013,A Great Movie for Sci Fi Lovers,This is one of the best movies for those who are science fiction lovers or Oscar lovers or anyone also of all ages Though it has a bit of flaws which is the reason why i gave the vote which is 9 out of 10 due to its a bit rushed story though it was quite good eventually and a few characters which are there however this movie is perfect why Because it has a strong chemistry between the cast and the characters role is dynamic in which the director and all of the crew members had did a great job on this film Also this is one of Sandra Bullock s best movie though the Blind Side is good but its a bit clich d but Gravity is not Rather Gravity is something that is really very original and while most space movies and science fiction movies were quite boring and were lacking of story and the dynamic Gravity did shined out from most of the films of its genre Overall this movie is really a good movie just that they need to expand more time a bit as I felt it is a bit rushed and they did not did a great job a bit on the ending just need to elaborate more but it is still a very good movie that has brought me closer to liking movies of its own genre,9

2 March 2014,"A visual masterpiece, although far from flawless concerning story and characters",Gravity or as I like to call it 99 Reasonable Arguments Against Becoming an Astronaut is one of the most visually striking and impressive films in recent history and definitely a benchmark for all the science fiction flicks to come after it The good news about this is that Alfonso Cuar n didn t solely achieve this because of the hundred million budget he was provided with but also through wonderful imagination and I assume loads of research Writing a script with only one or two on screen characters in a life threatening situation has lately become a Hollywood screenwriter s favourite thing to do and Gravity doesn t exactly reinvent this drama sub genre That isn t of much consequence however as the UK US co production is centred on a person s behaviour and the emotions induced under these grave circumstances Sandra Bullock is this person in Gravity and quite possibly gives the performance of her career if not an Oscar worthy one as she remains realistic even when she s the only person we see and thus undergoes even more scrutiny than otherwise There isn t really anything we get to know about her character other than her daughter having died at the age of four but just her being in and attempting to handle such a situation is highly interesting to watch Anyway what you ll really remember about Gravity are the visuals As far as I ve read pretty much anything besides the faces of Bullock and her colleague in peril George Clooney was created through special effects and yet the film is one of the most lifelike and believable depictions of space ever made And while I m unaware of how much cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki participated in the looks of Gravity the result is an immensely good looking motion picture showing space as a place of heaven like beauty in one scene and as a frightening and dark setting for a horror film in the other Every visual aspect about it is meticulously wrought and stunning to look at making you appreciate just how much work was invested in realising every tiny detail about the film in the best way With such a big scale production a plot less thin and predictable would ve been desirable especially due to the fact that you need more than just visuals to make a film rewatchable But there is really no denying that Cuar n has accomplished a most impressive and breathtaking film with Gravity that should at least scoop the technical trophies at the Academy Awards,
10 March 2014,One of my favorite drama films,The movie is still is a good movie for a exciting thriller movie but until i heard all the high pitch moments of the movie it got very loud but after the movie got a little exciting i enjoyed it very much But i have to say Sandra Bullock has a good role as a engineer but i have to say very great This movie i really deserve a higher rating But when the movie still a exciting movie it still have this short film called Aninqaaq that i fought was very relaxing then the movie but when the high pitch comes there s silence after it That s why it s getting weird after a high pitch then no sound coming This movie is the best movie ever,10

28 February 2016,In space no one can hear you yawn,Gravity is a perfect example for huge budget films and gadgets delivered by lack of talent First of all this movie brings nothing new or impressive I would like to say that the visuals were amazing and ground breaking as the film premise but unfortunately there is nothing really new here The scenery was indeed beautiful but so was Space Odyssey which was made about 50 years ago The experience of staying alone in space was nothing near the claustrophobic tension of Alien Then there s the script or should I say the lack of The dialogues were flat and full of clich s and the sound was a cluster of mumbles of rubbish between the astronauts and their radio It is very obvious that the film makers relied mostly on visuals with this one Unfortunately the camera work was not brilliant at all apart for some parts which were not bad but it was mostly nauseating They even tried to do the fetus shot with Bullock floating in fetus position but that was too forced to be creative That was done just before Sigourney sorry Bullock started removing her clothes and started floating around in her underwear because the film was not clich d enough until then And the highlight the cast A huge budget film with a high caliber actors and what do we get Clooney s acting was stale and uninspiring It seems as though his mind was in what s for dinner later rather than his struggles in space Bullock was just as much of a catastrophe It is hard to separate the bad acting from the bad script but watching her floating around in space without any supporting cast was painful All in all this movie is like slow torture It s only saving points were decent soundtrack occasional moments of thrill and the hope that it will all be over in an hour,4
7 December 2013,Modern Classic,Gravity 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuar n is at its heart a film of survival of battling an inhospitable environment against all odds with no help and little chance of success Framed like this the film looks less like a science fiction film and more like a tale of survival Cuar n has endeavoured to make the space environment as realistic as possible from the interior of space stations to the movement of the human body in zero gravity Imaginatively utilising 3D he shoots the many scenes set in the deathly silence of space to simulate the appearance of the camera floating The audience feels like they too are in the midst of space buoying alongside Clooney and Bullock This creates a sense of credibility throughout and makes the peril the characters face even tauter Cuar n has crafted a milieu that is ideal for showing the fragility of humanity against the vastness of the cosmos writing the screenplay with his son Jon s they populate the drama with only two characters to reinforce the emptiness of space These two characters though are the audience s anchor and are refreshingly well written recognisably human reacting to events in a way that conforms to reality Both Clooney and Bullock are excellent never letting the extensive CGI dominate while being appropriately ordinary enough to allow the viewer to identify with them particularly Bullock This is crucial for a film that concentrates on so few characters The cinematography by five time Academy Award nominee Emmanuel Lubezki perhaps acts as another character in the film being the prism through we which enter the drama Starting with a bravely held shot of Earth it permits us to slowly make sense of the conversation over the radio between the astronauts and NASA represented by an un seen Ed Harris one of the stars of Apollo 13 1995 It continues with an extraordinary thirteen minute long continuous shot that is supremely virtuosic their incredible duration carried on throughout the entire film Yet this isn t done for its own sake in doing so Cuar n brings you into the film and introduces a sense of claustrophobia with people stuck inside their spacesuits and the cramped interiors of escape shuttles and space stations This had to be worked out in immense detail far in advance of shooting meaning cinematography and editing by Cuar n and Mark Sanger is intimately linked The music by Steven Price is very good allowing for silence where there needs to be and overall this exemplar of pure cinema with no villain except the harshness of the universe is probably the best original film of the year It masterfully builds tension and character simultaneously and remains resolutely human throughout Hollywood can still surprise,9
14 November 2014,"Technically impressive, but not much more",2001 it is not but GRAVITY is a tense and at times thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character The plot is simple two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them The cast is quite small and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom George Clooney does his usual ladies man routine which he does quite well and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place That aside they do an admirable job with the script they were given Where the movie really excels is in the visual department Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar and it shows on screen These are some of the most impressive space effects that I ve seen in a long time although calling them ground breaking might be giving it a little too much credit The score is also worth mentioning and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film Still I felt like the story was lacking enough and the middle 45 50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit I have a feeling that I d be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters but I didn t so this is how I feel about it The first half hour and the last 20 minutes were superb but the middle dragged a little too much Overall it is a movie worth seeing although to get the full effect of the visuals it would probably be best to see this on the largest screen possible and with a decent sound system Best movie of 2013 No but it s still pretty good for what it is,6
17 August 2022,Boring,The visual effects are very good It s great to get a view of Earth from space and it s nice to see close up shots of Hubble the Space shuttle and the International Space Station inside and outside But the story is boring,7
19 December 2013,"""What a movie""",Sometimes are movies that without warning take us to another level of emotions and visuals Gravity offer that I read that a lot of people complain about the weak script I think was good or what do you want Aliens Invasion Monters Space chips fighting No no no this is a space drama and that s it Cuaron in the direction was extraordinary The special effects sublime believe me you think you are in space Lubenski the Oscar is yours The music awesome Sandra Bullock Simply amazing Just look the movie and have the ride of you life of course in space,8
1 January 2020,Really Good,Gravity was a great movie to experience It seemed nothing really even happened in the movie It was just floating from one space station to another But it was cool I really enjoyed it You could think about the world just watching Bullock in space Clooney and her did very good Very good movie Highly recommend 7 stars,7
11 November 2013,"Visually Stunning, and Overall a Good Movie",So today I went to watch the 2013 s most Awaited Sci Fi Movie Gravity starring One of my favorite Stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I was waiting for it for a long time but couldn t watch it earlier at its release Alfonso Cuar n did his best again Graphics were Amazing and movie was worth watching It s less Sci Fi and more breathe taking thriller in Space that s beautifully Directed The award winning actress Sandra Bullock George Clooney were also great in their acting This is one of best Science Fiction and Space movie I ve ever seen and definitely is in year s top 10 films list but i think it s a very little bit overrated I am not saying that it s not worth watching I am just Reviewing it Well Overall it s a Good movie and you ll enjoy watching it in 3D 2013 released many big Sci Fi s like Ironman 3 Pacific Rim Star Trek Into Darkness Elysium and Gravity is best than all of these in Cinematography You should definitely put this into your watch list for your next movie weekend And I would highly recommend this to you P S My English ain t very good so Please Excuse any Mistake Have a Nice Day,9
20 October 2019,A fine contribution to the outer-space genre,Astronauts in a U S space mission two of whom are played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney face grave danger when a space mission of another country causes havoc in outer space The film s basic elements story directing and acting are all fine though perhaps not equal to the extremely high acclaim this film has received What truly deserves the acclaim though are the brilliant special effects and other technical aspects photography sound etc which are exceptional Seeing the film in IMAX and 3 D adds to the enjoyment Viewers can almost feel the same experience as those in the film It is frightening and thrilling at the same time The benchmark of space films remains 2001 A Space Odyssey But Gravity is still a fine competitor Rating 8 out of 10 Award Worthy Achievements Special Effects and other Technical Aspects,8

3 March 2014,"It is so bad, I have to register and write a review!",I find some of the reviews about this movie laughable and ridiculous Perhaps the hype and marketing campaign money poured to invite people to watch it already conditioned people that this movie is good I even read that this is the best and the last movie Bullock will make another reason why this becomes a highly anticipated film of 2013 But THE MOVIE IS AWFUL They ignore science and dwell on the ridiculous plot that insults whatever wit you have If you want to watch one person floating around space for 90 minutes this movie is for you Otherwise don t watch it You are just going to waste your time and money that you would rather spend on more important things,1

13 November 2013,Believe the hype!,In the month between the US release and the UK release there was a ton of hype about Gravity Some calling it THE cinematic experience of the year some calling it the most stunning looking film some saying it is Sandra Bullock s virtuoso performance a must see movie After seeing it for myself I kind of have to agree on all points We join veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney and rookie Ryan Stone Bullock on a repair mission to the Hubble Telescope until the debris from a destroyed satellite causes chaos and so begins the thrill ride that is Gravity And it is definitely a thrill ride of emotions as we follow the two astronauts with the focus on the rookie and how she copes with the frankly terrifying ordeal and her emotional journey of self belief and survival Throughout the 90 minutes we re with her as she experiences the anxiety the disorientation the despair the vulnerability the danger the hopelessness the desperation then the belief hope and relief I was exhausted by the end And I can positively say that I ve not been as gripped throughout a movie as I have this one The VFX work is simply stunning Not overblown or in your face but giving you that sense of realism as if you ve been watching a NASA video I thought that the musical score by Steven Price worked really well too and helped to expand the emotional feel of Stone s ordeal Overall Gravity is well worth the hype that has been thrown at it Tense emotional and a superb performance from the focal star what more do you need,9
2 December 2013,Gravity is more than just a film--it's an experience,Gravity is more than just a film it s an experience Words can do little to convey the visual astonishment this movie creates It gives a very good sense of what it is like to be alone and scared in the vacuum of space No sound No gravity No Oxygen Gravity is the unquestionably the most impressive display of special effects work you will see in modern cinema Despite featuring strong performances from both Bullock and Clooney the real plaudits must go to director Cuaron who manages to turn a simple premise into a visually breathtaking gripping thrill ride An absolutely terrifying yet gripping film any movie lover must see The first person point of view combined with 3D takes the visual experience to a whole new level An Absolutely awesome Experience Everything I could ask for in a film,9

10 November 2013,Artificial tension.,The fuel the movie has apart from the visuals is Sandra Bullocks emotions and it s just wasn t enough Maybe it s because there is no plot though in my opinion Sandra Bullocks character wasn t very interesting and intriguing and I didn t care much about her I really hated her constant whining The supposed to be tension was very artificial The director just threw more and more obstacles instead of building a tension around a character I wasn t involved with the characters emotions I thought they were artificial either While I don t think that the actors Clooney and Bullock made a good job I think that the director is the one who totally blew it up Sorry but even if he succeeded in making cash for the production company by adequate trailers and a very aggressive promotion in the long run it will be regarded as a stain on his career Like Avatar Gravity was attended mainly because of its visuals But Avatar had enough plot and character development to sustain the visuals while Gravity had none,4
21 October 2013,Gravity,Originally going into Gravity if I have to be honest about it I was not quite sure what to expect and my expectations were not all that high Seeing the early trailers for the film made me a bit concerned that the film would either be incredibly boring and just another long line of excuses in using this 3D technology for effects and what not or that the film would be kind of like the summer spectacle films released that have big star power boasting it as well as a lot of special effects and action scenes and quite frankly I was not interested in seeing a movie like what I just described On the other hand there were tons of reviews by critics and users online calling it one of the best films of the year and some calling it one of the best science fiction films of all time The great reviews did peak my interest a little bit and I finally gave in and went to see Gravity My thoughts Overall pretty impressed The film was not boring or self indulgent with special effects as I had worried that it may be and also it was not action scene after action scene with endless and ridiculous special effects either What I got instead was a more quiet and subtle film but nonetheless one that packs an emotional punch To either compliment or ridicule the special effects and visuals of the film would not be right seeing as I opted out of seeing the film in 3D and instead just saw a regular projection booth version of the film While some of the cinematography and visuals were impressive I think they would have even been more so in 3D and that is where a lot of praise from critics and online reviewers are coming from so seeing as I did not see it in that medium I will stay out of that debate and just say that what I did see was impressive but that with most films like that that it was neither here nor there for me and the effects neither added anything nor took anything away from my viewing experience either Gravity is above all a film about survival I will not go into any more details than that so you can enjoy this spoiler free review and discover the film on your own if you decide to do so The film has a shorter running time and while sometimes I like films to have a bit of a longer running time to add more character and depth to said films I personally found that keeping Gravity at the length that they did was not only a good decision but one that suits the film perfectly as well Everything you could want was put into the 90 minutes of this film You had really good character study as well as interesting storytelling and an added emotional content that I felt really helped create mood and both empathy and fascination in watching the characters as well There were times especially in the beginning of the film where it got quite tense and I could feel myself going with the film into those emotions and feeling the type of dread and fear that these two characters are feeling It wasn t the most pleasant feeling in the world but at the same time I appreciated that the film had an affect on me like that and that what I was watching was connecting to me and myself to it as well Going through their whole ordeal during the course of this film I got scared for these characters cared for them and at times were rooting for them to make the right decisions to save themselves and get to safety The empathetic and emotional content really added to the overall feeling of the film thanks to some top notch writing and direction as well as the very impressive lead performances of the film If I have to be perfectly honest about it I would have to say that nothing I have seen Sandra Bullock in has ever really wowed or moved me in any way That being said I have not seen a lot of her films because they have never interested me and same with the style of performances she often gives as well Keep in mind that I never saw the role that gave her the Oscar for The Blind Side Perhaps if I saw that I may feel a little bit differently I have to say however that she completely held her own in this role and gave a terrific performance that is sure to earn her an Oscar nomination next year as well as perhaps the Oscar itself She shows so much vulnerability and strength in this role but we can still see how fragile and scared she is inside during the course of the film and how she tries to triumph that is not only interesting to watch because of the writing and directing but also for her strong performance as well It completely changed my thoughts on her as an actress and I hope she is allowed and chooses more projects like this where she is allowed to show this great acting range that she has The film has a slower pace at times but there is so much both visually and with the characters that you try and take in that it is never boring and you are always watching with absolute fascination and awe I credit the filmmakers for not making an action packed film with explosions and special effects and instead giving us a real story that looks real and feels real too We feel what these characters do and their ordeal through this film is often felt on us the viewers which is not always an easy task to accomplish,10
4 December 2013,Outstanding - Should win multiple Oscars,Not only is this a brilliant film but if you watch it in 3D it becomes an amazing experience I have read some negative reviews on IMDb and I don t get it If you want a 100 accurate view of space then you should watch a 3D documentary about space If you want to be 100 entertained and be on the edge of your seat throughout then go watch this movie My wife and I went to see this and were mesmerised from the start I found myself totally engrossed and felt as though I experienced everything Sandra Bullock s character experienced as I was taken on a journey I would hate to be taken on for real Go see this film in an Imax 3D theatre nothing else will do it justice,10
16 October 2013,Simply stunning visuals,Saw this flick today was floored by the story the acting and the absolutely stunning visual effects This film had me riveted to my seat gripping the arm rest so tightly at times I had to shake out the cramps From the very start of this picture I was amazed by the brilliant cinematography and soon found myself feeling as if I was witnessing on screen events in person Also very impressed with the attention to detail the film makers put into every aspect of the story the fact that space exploration is exciting but very dangerous is something that most of us can understand in an abstract way Viewing this film will leave one wondering if given the chance to participate in space flight would one be inclined to do so knowing what could happen I for one would take the chance,9
7 April 2018,Overly beautiful CGI can't compensate,The CGI was beautiful too beautiful to be realistic in some cases but that couldn t overcome the ridiculous movie By the middle of the movie I wanted to slap the character By the time the movie was over I found myself hoping she drowned She was clumsy and incapable of anything All she did was cry and moan the entire time The kind of people that become astronauts must be highly trained physically strong and mentally stable This character wasn t any of those things Not only was the premise of the story too far fetched to be believable but even Interstellar was executed in such a way to make it more likely to happen I know it s just a movie and it s just meant to be entertaining but I found myself groaning far too much to be entertained,3
24 February 2014,Gravity is a masterpiece!,First I must start out by saying that Sandra Bullock s performance in the lead role of Gravity was absolutely superb I don t think anyone could have performed it as well as her As far as I m concerned she s the best actress of 2013 George Clooney was also superb as veteran astronaut commander Matt Kowalski I just can t see any two people doing as good a job as these two stars But that s just the starting line up The special effects and visual effects engineered by the ultra professional organization Framestore were no less than spectacular The orbiting spacecraft simulations weightlessness zero gravity kinetics impacts and motion were so real that they seemed like miracles of cinematography I simply can t say enough about the people who created these amazing special effect sequences Their work is the main reason I agree with James Cameron and Anthony Scott when they said that Gravity has rewritten the rules of cinema as we know them making Gravity the best space film ever made I m an aerospace engineer and there were a few scientific inaccuracies and some slightly far fetched premises in the movie But given the premises Gravity s accuracy and realism is second to none in the movie industry It is difficult to call this film science fiction because although the story is fictitious the science is very realistic Finally Alfonso Cuaron is the main person responsible for this great film He directed co produced with David Heyman and co wrote Gravity with his son Jonas He has been nominated for best director he and Heyman for best picture by the Academy Awards and he has won or been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and British Film Academy awards for Gravity I think he deserves to win them all Gravity is a masterpiece,10
21 December 2015,Horrible!,Waste of time money don t ever bother watching unless you want to waste time on seeing the synopsis of this movie drag on until the end Want a plot exciting breath taking intriguing movie to watch watch anything but this epic fail how it even has 7 9 is a mystery itself just like why the movie ever had been made Should of been rated 0 9 out of 10 i actually watched it to the end to catch a glimpse of the story but no nothing just a dumb woman whose in space is scared of space and G Clooney drifted out in space in the first 30 mins doesn t explain what happened why the satellites were falling back why there were dead people in the other space stations THE BEST PART IS WHEN SANDRA B is barking like a dog lmfao,
16 June 2014,"Technically brilliant...otherwise, not so much.",I heard a lot about Gravity All the critics loved it for its brilliant cinematography I was hyped to say the least But what I saw was jaw dropping In a really bad way Don t get me wrong this movie deserves its Oscars in Visual Effects and Cinematography but Gravity is pretty dull otherwise At first you might be intrigued by the long takes and the pretty effects but after roughly 15 minutes you will see how hollow the plot really is I don t want to take away any plot points but everyone would be able to tell this story in about 7 minutes Everything is so slow Sandra Bullock does her best to work with this lackluster script but even she isn t up to par And the ending Seriously All in all I recommend the movie for its visual effects and if you don t care about a boring plot it s the perfect movie for you But if you expect as much as an enjoyable watch go look somewhere else because you won t find it here,4
13 October 2013,Well Done for What it is,This film is about 2 things as I see it space station missions and survival I think the movie accomplished an interesting story in both respects As to the latter the film did a good job of establishing a desperate pace in which every second counts there is little rest for the weary and Murphy s Law is in full effect and no one is going to save you but yourself so you better nut up or shut up for good Space is a perfect setting for these themes as the movie effectively conveyed the isolation of space the importance of rigorous training so ingrained that certain actions become involuntary and the sheer wonder of modern technology These aspects of the film along with its breathtaking scenery and its compelling acting by the way props to Bullock for her hard work on that rocking 49 year old body almost make it a Must See but overall my reaction to a friend who tells me that he hasn t seen this flick will probably be more like It s worth it if you ever do and see it in 3 D if you can than You really need to see that movie For more reviews and a kick ass podcast check out www livemancave com,6
24 July 2022,"""I've got a bad feeling about this mission""",Great movie so much is done with so little But what was the gravitational force pulling George Clooney away They weren t in orbit there should have not been any kinetic energy Anyway apart from that stellar movie It s visually stunning and gripping all the way with a minimal cast,9
4 May 2014,Great Movie!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
7 March 2016,Visual experience and should be viewed and rated as such,I suspect that the majority of the people who dislike this movie have only seen it on small screen and or in 2d Like Avatar this movie was made to be a visual 3d experience and that s exactly what it is and how it should be rated and this is coming from someone who is usually a 3d cynic Yes in 2d and on small screen it loses much of it s impressiveness But you can t fully judge this movie if you have only seen it like that as that was never the way it was intended to be watched So I can t really blame you for disliking the movie if you ve never seen it as intended So please just take my advice Watch it in 3d and it s a great experience Watch it in 3d on the big screen and you ll be blown away,9
17 March 2015,A prime example of where a film concentrates entirely on the graphical accuracy.,A prime example of where a film concentrates entirely on the graphical accuracy Now I m sure most of you have seen other critiques praise the director for the best space film to exist but this is just far from that They re just overrated claims I recommend you watch this film for not its aesthetics but to discover the same viewership opinion as myself I honestly wanted to love this movie but the script and dialogue is just overtly lacking I must say I do love the graphics They re probably the best for an outerspace film However I watch films solely on the basis of the storyline and narrative acclaim You ll find a vast majority of irrational and unexercised users suggest that this film is easily the best space related film but to totally disregard 2001 A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13 If you want to experience a real space narrative watch those films and hide from this overdramatised film But if you do wish to consume this over hyped blockbuster where an astronaut cyclically floats from one exaggerated disaster to the next whilst consistently shrieking by all means go for it,3
7 November 2013,looks awesome,Saw this at the Leeds Film Festival at the Everyman Theatre Wonderful comfort but the tension was such that I couldn t relax into my cushioned sofa instead my body was in the main knotted gripping hand rests etc as the film progressed I would guess this is a must watch in 3D visually I think it would be much poorer without the glasses Some of the shots of Outer Space were simply breath taking and it was easy to live the drama alongside the two Actors Bullock is fantastic You can really believe in her character Clooney has a few of the best lines and basically plays himself but gives a decent supporting performance No doubt there were a few holes in the plot but nonetheless surely one of the top films this year Im not sure its quite up there alongside 2001 as it isn t the sort of film where you need to think Its more pure escapism where the increasing tension is more important than the actual story,9
29 December 2013,"great effects, middling drama",An astronaut with a tragic past finds herself alone in space after a catastrophic event engulfs her shuttle It is only through facing certain death that she re discovers the will to live This is perhaps the most immersive compelling use of the 3D format to date though given that the format has failed to live up to its potential that is not exactly high praise The arena of space is thoroughly explored in 3D and the swinging camera extreme close ups and mammoth wide shots suitably convey the claustrophobia and agoraphobia that space must engender in astronauts Sound design is also persuasively authentic though the screeching soundtrack that cuts before silence in the open sequence could have been toned down a decibel or two The special effects are top notch and clearly the film s biggest selling point They unashamedly draw attention to themselves which unfortunately means they work at the expense of the narrative The plight and journey of Bullock s character would have been much more cathartic if more thought had been given to dialogue and tempo Instead she swings from one mini disaster to another Bullock apparently channeling Annie Porter doing her best to drive that bus in Speed Bullock s performance is engaging rather than outstanding Clooney on the other hand is simply miscast Like the effects he is too obviously cinematic too much his cheeky charming self too much a reminder of the artifice and Hollywood ness of it all I suspect a more grounded character actor like Stanley Tucci might have excised this role of the frivolousness Clooney s presence inspires Wonderful effects a considered deployment of 3D and a story that is enjoyable if not exactly sublime make this a good outing for those who enjoy event cinema Like Avatar this film s weaknesses will come into sharp focus on DVD And with a running time close to 90 minutes the filmmakers should win awards for economy and self discipline Big screen cinema but not one to re visit,6
20 October 2013,Sandra Bullock floating around is a surprisingly stunning experience,Space the final frontier of near death and thrilling situations That sums the movie up If we left out the jaw dropping ambiance scenery and cinematography When the first cut in this movie happened I clapped Wanna know why Because it doesn t happen till 3 minutes into the movie when the satellite debry starts cutting through dudes faces That is masterpiece editing done by the proud Mexican I m Mexican Alfonso Cuar n The flowing of every scene is smooth but tense at the same time You gasp for air and control when you are put in Bullock s point of view while she spins into the nothingness of space And those scenes last and are absolutely beautifully choreographed The tense atmosphere that Cuar n achieves doesn t let go of you until the last second of the movie for you to realize how sweaty you are The script and dialogue aren t something to be amazed about but the acting makes up for it The charm and charisma of Clooney are entertaining and you really believe some of the scenes done by Sandra Bullock who plays this really unlucky but at the same time lucky astronaut Cuar n achieves greatness with eye popping visuals and a surprisingly low for the things you experience in the movie budget and that is something you don t see that often I can really see some Oscar statues in Cuaron s pocket in 2014,10
20 October 2013,"""Citizen Kane"" for a new-age",Citizen Kane was groundbreaking for many reasons and is still considered one of if not the best films ever made simply for it s use of camera work cinematography and style Gravity pulls you down to it s point of view from the very beginning Alfonso Cuaron uses his style of camera work that makes the entire film seem like it was made in one long shot never giving the viewer a second to catch their breath I have never left a film before wondering How did they film that The writing and special effects were also incredible This is one of the rare films that MUST be seen in 3D otherwise you just wont get the effect of the film in it s entirety One of the best films I have ever seen 10 10,10
10 November 2013,Could have been so much better,Cinematografic on very high grounds If there any references that come close it would be the movie 2010 and a scene out of Star Trek s First Contact namely the scene with the Borg outside on the ship building an antenna As good as this movie is towards the camera work and visuals as sad it is to see that the script is propably 10 pages Yes there is some action packed scenes and there is some tension as well but do not expect the quality of what was done in the 2 references above It is daring to make a movie with only 2 characters however it does only work here for 50 because the action is limited to its contents there is not much that can happen there out in space is there Then there is the typical Hollywood mess Sandra pepping herself up with the traditional music going with the scene and then the last scene on the beach Please spare us of such nonsense Did I enjoy the movie yes but I took twice a zip at my watch in order to find out how late it was and that s a bad thing 10 points for the man behind the camera 2 points for script,6
23 February 2014,Gravity did grab my attention,With all the hype surrounding this movie and being a fan of Sandra Bullock in the process I simply had to see what it was all about needless to say I liked it well enough but can t help but wonder if all that hype is misguided Alfonso Cuaron directs a 90 minute film in fine style the spectacular cinematography and effects are conducted with such tenacity you can t help but feel you re actually in space It really is astounding work that alone marks a 10 10 The casting of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney is an interesting aspect in my opinion Clooney is bordering on the annoying side but Bullock adds a real sense of sensitivity and emotion to the part of Ryan Stone even if she is just talking to herself nearly all of the time while any dramatic scenes add a sense of urgency and feeling to the viewer to want to stick with the story and find out what happens next It is these characteristics to Gravity that make it stand on its own two feet well enough However although Gravity proved an amiable enough film to me perhaps due to the technical complexity surrounding it too much emphasis has been placed on this In the not so near future it may be seen to be a slightly if not highly overrated movie 6 10,6
14 June 2014,special effects / disaster movie,I expected the movie to be about the psychological tensions of being a female captain in a traditionally male dominated world Nope that was not it at all Sandra Bullock is the only character alive for most of the movie She has to carry the entire movie It is a special effects disaster flick She moves from one space station to another escaping by the skin of her teeth as they are blown to bits by space debris The special effects are quite believable I don t know how they were done People and objects float rotating serenely There are no crude wires to get in the way of the action The space stations are incredibly cramped I can imagine the locker room smell They look completely plausible I had waves of claustrophobia just looking an them on the TV screen The movie ended too soon I was far from convinced she was home free I wanted to see something of what happened to her character Ryan Stone after she made it back to earth Some things did not make sense What was this somewhat clueless woman doing on a space station Why could she walk immediately after months in space Why is there so much noise in space especially when dialogue makes the point there isn t Why is there no way to make radio contact with earth from any of the space stations For me it was too repetitive Too much action and not enough psychology It is a boy flick masquerading as a chick flick,7
20 November 2013,Audience in peril!,After all the hype I was half expecting not to like this movie but it was impossible not to be blown away by it The CGI is totally awesome there was never a moment when I didn t feel I was up there orbiting the earth with Sandra Bullock and the wreckage of her spacecraft GRAVITY is as ground breaking space breaking if not quite as trippy as Stanley Kubrick s 2001 was back in 1968 There have been documentaries with more plot than this Why would a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope need a Medical Officer 100 years ago the Woman in Peril theme entailed tying her to a railway track Here Bullock is adrift in space on her own for ten nerve shredding minutes Then the audience has to hold its breath for the rest of the movie wondering if she and and George Clooney can somehow beat the odds and make it back to Earth I did occasionally wonder why Gorgeous George was cast in the role when maybe some younger hunk might given the movie a bit more teen appeal The same could be said of Sandra Bullock I guess but she acts her socks off presumably entirely working against a blue backdrop for the CGI guys to fill in You are with this woman every inch of the way Top marks to her and the director and cinematographer and those CGI people This is an Audience in Peril movie,8

5 October 2013,Magnificent,So the hype for Gravity is at an insane high right now It s gotten some of the best reviews in years and that hype has crossed over to the mainstream audience as well as hardcore film buffs I don t think this is a perfect film and it s not entirely original but man does it work The cinematography is outstanding as are the sound and visual effects The two leads are also pretty strong Bullock in particular giving a performance I m sure most people weren t aware she could give This is a truly movie star performance one that will be associated with Bullock as a pea for the rest of her career This is strongly recommended definitely to be seen on the big screen,
7 April 2014,Most over-hyped movie of all time?,I m still wondering how it won 7 Oscars and was nominated for Best Picture Maybe it s just me Pros Audio visual effects are well done Action begins quickly and It s relatively short a pro in the sense that the pain of watching is over quickly Cons Dialog is awful Acting is awful in Sandra George s defense no one can save this script Plot is borderline comical when it s attempting to be suspenseful dramatic and By no fault of the film director actors this movie set high expectations at least for me and couldn t have been further from the mark Overall it wins 2 stars for the audio visual effects and the fact that should this movie not have won 7 Oscars my expectations would have been lower and I wouldn t have been so disappointed,2
22 December 2016,Astonishing,I never got around to seeing this in the cinema but I just rented the DVD from my library and good grief this was amazing I was missing out on the 3D which I hate anyway it gives me a headache but even so the visuals cinematography CGI were incredible I also loved the score and sound design The plot is so small as to be almost non existent and the stuff about her daughter would ordinarily have me reaching for a sick bag but somehow this seemed much more than the sum of its parts and at the end of it I was almost on the verge of tears I m not usually much moved by movies in that way but this one really gripped me The kind of immersive transcending spectacle I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make If this ever comes back to an IMAX screen in my vicinity I ll be first in the queue,10
1 February 2014,Gravity is spectacular,I ve read plenty of extremely negative audience reviews of Gravity here The line I really wanted to like it has been in many of them And I think it s claptrap Based on the reviews I ve read it seems everyone who hated this film went to the theater with the intention of hating it wanting to be cool by being against the popular opinion and must have focused more on playing with their cell phones or something than paying attention to the actual film Gravity is one of the best films of 2013 I do acknowledge its flaws yes there are scientific inaccuracies Yes the themes of rebirth and letting go aren t explored very deeply Yes the plot is predictable and implausible Yes the film won t have much value when watched from a TV screen But the film is incredibly exciting and engrossing visually fantastic beautifully shot and incredibly intense and efficient with its short running time It is more than a film it is an experience which has to be seen on the big screen It is a film which asks you to go with it and when you do it is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences seen for a long time If you go in expecting another 2001 A Space Odyssey you ll be disappointed Gravity isn t even science fiction It is an action thriller that just happens to be set in space so stop complaining about that it lacks substance Gravity is nowhere near 2001 in terms of quality but that is not the point The negative audience reaction speaks only about how these days when there s a film meant to be seen in theaters most people don t seem to understand it and just dismiss it as style over substance Gravity is an extremely intense piece of filmmaking that is a feast for the eyes and ears,9

7 October 2013,"Great technical pitfalls on some main points, poor for story and dialogs",The fall of George Clooney is absolutely not realistic there is no technical reason why he should fall away Other blog s published a complete list of big errors locally some effect is realistic but the general picture is impossible the several space stations involved in the movie move at a relative speed of several kilometers sec a satellite or a space station takes several days to fall down from the height of several hundreds kilometers etc Anyway what really I could not stand were the poor story the silly dialogs the pleonastic and exaggerated recitation it is a bad film technics apart The scene of Sandra Bullock on the lake shore at the end of the film reminded me the dying soldier Peter Sellers with the trumpet in Hollywood Party PS she was not dying,3
21 July 2014,Could have been much better.,Alert This review may contain spoilers I had heard a lot about this movie s special effects and acting so I eagerly looked forward to seeing it I also like George Clooney as an actor To me the characters in this movie were very one dimensional and hollow I can t help but wonder if the actors actually read the script before signing on the dotted line Clooney s astronaut was too cheery whimsical and far fetched making small talk by repeating pointless jokes and stories and playing country music while space walking on a serious mission drowning out communication with NASA in many instances His character did not seem professional in his conduct at all but rather a nuisance many times I also found the film very depressing and full of despair especially Bullock s character who had lost her 4 year old daughter in a tragic death on earth sometime before the mission I could not help but wonder why her character with such an emotionally disturbing event would be chosen to be on this mission She seemed to panic a lot and to be totally unprepared for emergencies I expected much more drama and tension in the story arch it seemed way out of balance with too much emphasis on negativity loss and not enough hope to keep the viewer sustained The script needed much better development and dialogue before shooting the film It is a shame Gravity was made in a half baked manner without being carefully thought out and planned It could have been MUCH MUCH BETTER,3

16 October 2014,Awful all around... but it served to test my new blue-ray,After getting a nice TV and a nice blue ray player I decided to buy a movie in 3d for the debut of my gear Gravity seemed the perfect choice for my first ever blue ray 3d space Bullock Clooney expectations were high Only thing that saved my night the 3d effects It made me feel almost like watching IMAX Hubble not that the effects were that great but it felt like it other than that do not waste your time Voices apart you can count on only two characters and one dies half way in the movie and you are left with one person talking to herself and performing all those very implausible tasks like moving from one module to another etc Save yourself from this space debris and find something else to watch,1
11 October 2013,Space version of Cast away,With the high reviews and large box office showing for the movie Gravity I was really looking forward to it I have always garnered an interest in space and this unknown frontier is a brave new world I did see the movie in 2D not 3D but I believe that a good story is a good story no matter what format it is presented It s about when the space shuttle is hit with space trash debris and then thing run amuck The two surviving astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney struggle to make it to an old abandoned Russian space station With lots of heavy breathing and intense accompanied music these scenes of a close death are built up Sandra Bullock looks amazing and she plays her usual nervous unsure character Lacking where her usual snort laugh and giggle I would recommend Gravity as a rental and if you must see it then check it out on 3D where objects will float all around you Dr Wilson Trivino T4Vista Twitter Instagram,6
28 November 2019,Great direction and cinematography but a bad script,Long story short my title says it all Alfonso Cuaron has masterful direction with long takes and excellent movement followed up by beautiful cinematography but it s sadly wasted on a dumb script The characters are thin dialogue is cheeky and wooden and the events that occur just have you asking questions It s not the events that occur to move the plot forward but it s like the Cuaron brothers decided to shove dumb action scenes in this movie to build tension when this could ve been put towards the characters Also the music is the most generic score I ve heard in a big budget movie like this it sounds like they bought it off a stock music website Overall this movie isn t really worth the watch other than how they filmed it putting the camera in creative spots,3
15 November 2013,Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space,Space draws ours interest because most of us will never get to experience of the wonders that lurk there Director Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity is the best alternative to a trip to space There s no hyperbole that comes with describing Gravity because it is in fact magnificent Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer sent to space with experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney to service a Hubble Space Telescope Before completing their work on the Telescope they are hit with debris from another Satellite when the two individuals are separated and communication is lost Dr Stone not a trained astronaut must find her way to return safely to Earth In 2009 s Avatar James Cameron advanced visual effects to new heights in order to fit his image of the fictional world Pandora Like Cameron Cuaron s vision required him to invent new technology in order for the film to have the intimacy he desired for his audience The visuals are essential to the enjoyment of Gravity This isn t a film that could hold its weight with the screenplay alone Gravity is the best use of 3D ever in film I m not a supporter of 3D I never have been but Gravity gives me hope that the future will properly suit each film that uses 3D to enhance the experience not just a means to boost the box office sales Cuaron makes us feel that we are taken off of Earth and shuttled into space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney We feel like we have become a part of the story like a miscellaneous object floating with the characters If Gravity lacked 3D Cuaron would have had a more difficult time transporting us like he does Children of Men one of Cuaron s most praised films became famous for scenes that consisted of the long uninterrupted takes Instead of three or four minute scenes of that nature he pushes us even further with ten minutes without a single editing cut in Gravity This flow allows the audience to funnel its focus into the film and think about nothing else Cuaron only cuts when it is necessary to give us the perspective of his heroine How hard would that be Plays go uninterrupted for hours at times why is it so special here Because the camera work must follow the characters who succumb to gravity while they try to solve their predicaments The camera zooms in on the two actors as they float frontwards and backwards upside down right side up to make us empathize with the characters as well as establishing and tracking shots to show the magnitude of the action and scope out outer space The special effects are so realistic that a naive man would believe Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were trained as astronauts to shoot the film in outer space Visual effects are hardly ever a sole reason to see a film but Gravity is now the exception to that rule Film critics and analysts have been left baffled to understand how Cuaron conducted the thorough realism of outer space When an actor is offered a role that is a one woman show for two thirds of an entire film it can be daunting decision to sign on Sandra Bullock doesn t let the pressure affect her portrayal in fact she pulls something out of her that we have waited for her entire career Bullock doesn t challenge herself in the romantic comedies and the Feel Good Lifetime style dramas she often selects but in Gravity she delivers a strong performance that makes me proud of her acting ability Creating movies is like a balancing act Screenplays that are intricately written with great details and higher meanings typically won t fare well if the director s mind is on spectacle Gravity has spectacle at the top of its list The film has so much to show us therefore it makes sense for not having as much to tell But Gravity manifests that thinly plotted script can have as much meaning and life value as any novel adaptation Gravity is about life Not just life in space but it questions how every one of us view life Are we prepared to give up on everything because we ve faced obstacles that have knocked us down or is there beauty in fighting and climbing the ladder of life Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space Gravity proves stereotypes wrong Who ever made it a rule that movies in space or containing action had to be unrealistic Like me you may have seen the trailer and posters for Gravity and may think I m not in the mood for Science Fiction I m sure there are some inaccuracies but there s nothing predominantly unrealistic about it the setting just happens to be in outer space Don t wait for the DVD BluRay it won t be the same as the smashing experience in the 3D cinema Grade A Rating 9,
30 October 2014,top 10 most boring ever,Quite arguably and simply put the most boring film I have ever seen It truly is one of those films critics and people who want to ACT smart love Rubbish film from start to finish you just wait to see the climax of the film My friend feels exactly the same way about this film a rubbish film he couldn t even remember until he saw the trailer Wow a film which is shot in space not on planets just a space station A few problems with the space shuttle a few people die What a boring waste of my time and I created an IMDb account just to leave a review on this film Word cannot describe how boring I found this film And I have seen many many movies before one judges and thinks I do not know my movies,1
24 December 2013,Np space movie will ever be the same!,What is cinema Its the perfect blend of sights and sounds that should stir your audio visual sensory and in the process entertain you Even if its got a paperthin plot amazing performances and the right setting and score can create wonders for the audience Its also a medium with which we should be able to live out our fantasies Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity fulfills everything a movie should do Forget deep space battles and X Wings or the Enterprise swishing past by if possible forget Xenomorphs and LV 223 This is real life and it is at its best here Gravity opens with a shot of earth from space it panned for some seconds and I was left skeptic questioning if the whole movie would be so Images struck me from 2001 A Space Odyssey and while 2001 was never EVER a bad movie I didn t pay to watch it once again My misconceptions were raked minutes into the movie when George Clooney and Sandra Bullock s characters came into view chattering fixing stuff on a space satellite A few more minutes in they were left stranded in space with nothing but their wits and spacesuits with depleting oxygen Our protagonists from there on takes us on a bonafide roller coaster ride through space ensuing chaos thrills enough to make you feel the usually harmless intermission to empty your bladders intrusive Alfonso Cuaron has created a flawless masterpiece here Gravity will dumbfound you to levels beyond that you will even forget that you are watching a movie There were times where I forgot to breath like many in the audience You feel you are inside the protagonists spacesuit and believe me the beautiful world will immerse you not having to think twice that you are watching a movie On a surface its a survivalist movie but under the surface it has complex levels of philosophical goodness There was this particular scene where Ryan Stone takes on a foetal position as soon as she gets inside a space station simply awesome Alfonso Cuaron as evident from Children of Men is a director with a panache for rich visuals and simultaneously telling a gripping story and the same can be seen here in Gravity The plot isn t much to brag about but it wonderfully adheres to the visuals promising a journey you are not likely to forget anytime soon Had the actors weren t of caliber it could have gone utterly wrong considering you have barely 3 actors the whole of Gravity But when you ve got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the lead you can set aside whatever ill notions you ve got It could be considered a female centric movie and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone leaves no space for disappointment I wouldn t be surprised if she ends up with an Academy Award let alone for the movie or the visual effects George Clooney as usual brings the charisma and charm the wisdom as well as dalliance to Gravity The visual effects are stunning and beyond words For someone who s never been to space Gravity was as authentic an experience that I could have had and I am exceedingly pleased with it This is the kinda movie theatres are made for I watched it at the IMAX and I was sucked into the out of the world experience The visuals rich advanced and said to be engineered just for the movie it was an orgasmic sight to behold For a movie which is stripped much off its sounds the score comes into play less often as expected but when it does it does make for a terrifically tense experience Two thumbs up for Steven Price s captivating score I can t recommend Gravity enough Watching this on a small screen will never do justice to the efforts the cast and crew has put in the movie but more than that its a definitive experience of space travel Why would you want to shell out millions like thats possible when the same could be experienced with a few bucks That could be a implausible question but its as close we can get to space travel And frankly this movie has made me astrophobic One of the best movies of the year and worth every penny spent on the IMAX experience,8

8 October 2013,Compelling cinema,On one level this film is a triumph in 3D technology It s use is restrained yet glorious in places where it needs to be In a refreshing twist the trailer gives away all but a tiny fraction of the most impressive 3D scenes But for all of the gorgeous cinematography and breathtaking 3D action moments where you can t help but hold your breath nearly the whole film where Gravity triumphs are what it has to say about humanity and what it means to be alive and to be human We re all infants in the universe but on earth we re all in it together even if sometimes life isn t what we had planned Gravity explores us to enjoy the ride whatever that may be If I could give my fellow humans a couple words of advice bring tissues Lots of them 9 10,9

16 May 2017,Best movie ever!,Forget the visuals they are just a distraction instead look at the script look at the character of Ryan Stone how vulnerable yet never defeated she is She was introduced as a lonesome weak discontent and pessimistic character But by the end of the movie she has found new hope new strength new reason and purpose to fight for life despite the adversities she went through Ryan Stone is the main focus and if you focus on the main thing you re into a life changing movie going experience,10
30 June 2014,"More mediocrity than ""Armageddon"" and ""The Net"" combined",This movie had nearly as much contrived heroism and maudlin emotion as Armageddon and nearly the same goofy damsel in despair as Sandra Bullock s earlier movies but without quite convincing me that it was an acceptable use of my 82 minutes Thank goodness it wasn t any longer WTF were the Cuarons trying to do with this Did they add anything I couldn t tell I guess George Clooney added his winning smile and another big name on the marquis The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had a few sequences decent action All things considered though I wouldn t recommend it to anyone except for 13 year old girls who are hardcore fans of both Armageddon and Sandra Bullock,3
16 October 2013,Very Good,I ll give it a solid B to A Great visuals story acting Imax 3D excellent as always Reminds me something Ron Howard would do casting Tom Hanks but with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney The voice of Mission control was Ed Harris but you never saw him I am sure it will be up for some kind of Academy award Bullock is getting better roles nowadays She was perfect for the film I thoroughly enjoyed it and may just see it again soon You have to realize everything in space moves at about 17 500 miles hour unless you have something to slow you down,
4 October 2013,Visually striking and out of this world!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
8 October 2013,You must see this film,Being a huge Scifi fan I was expecting a lot from this film it blew my mind it has everything This could change the way films are made I thought Avatar was ground breaking but Gravity is out of this world stop reading this and go see it in the Cinema now do not wait to see this at home Its a true cinematic experience beyond anything I have seen before When you read how they made this film you really can see the talent of Sandra Bullock and Clooney shine through they are true masters of their craft Devlopment in technology is taking film making to a new level films that could have only been dreamt of a few years ago are now becoming a reality and we are benefiting in a huge way More please,10
11 October 2013,Best film so far of 2013,I can t probably think from where to start The film is simply WOW The whole team has taken a simple plot and executed and with perfection All details have been meticulously taken care of From acting to music everything is simply outstanding The most best part is effects making it seems that 3D was created for this movie It appears as if you are indeed in space Every scene is fake but it looks as if shooting indeed happened in space The storyline is so gripping that it keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats gasping for breath George Clooney has less screen time but Sandra bullock make up for it giving another solid performance of her career Must watch for all,10
8 October 2013,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,I don t normally write reviews but I was so impressed with this movie I decided to share my experience Rarely does a movie come along that truly impresses me Gravity has done just that Sandra Bullocks performance was nothing short of phenomenal I left this movie feeling amazed in shock and in a state of fatigue as if I had actually been in the shoes of Dr Ryan Sandra Bullocks Character Visually this movie is amazing The shots angles lightning and general feel make you believe you are in space I don t want to give any spoilers away but please do yourself a favor and go see this movie,10

18 January 2014,A masterpiece on its own,A simple almost minimalistic storyline is just an excuse for a reflexion about the hostility of space and for one of the most scientifically accurate movies about space since 2001 There is a remarkable and well thought management of camera planes which constantly gives the viewer an almost uncomfortable sensation of buoyancy and dizziness sometimes even nauseating I do not think there is another movie that so powerfully generates in the viewer a sensation so close to a weightless trip on an EVA i must admit that sometimes i felt space sick or what i believe could be accounted as such Not every movie around has to be a brain dazzling exercise of metaphors Gravity is much less pretentious absolutely linear hardly more than just descriptive But it is so visually outstanding the story although simple is so well told the movie just flows naturally Sandra Bullock is perfectly fitted for the role she delivers what she is supposed to and maybe even more than you would expect So if you like space movies but you want them to keep at least a minimum grade of scientific honesty while being an incredibly well developed piece of entertainment go and see it,9
1 March 2014,One of the worst movies,Why do filmmakers always characters that stupid That woman behaved like she ll have no training at all Breathe like crazy for nothing even though a 5 year old would figured out that you shouldn t breathe fast in a situation where oxygen can take over Do this movie makers have a lack of imagination Do you know how annoying that is for some viewers to see that kind of idiotic unrealistic behaviors And all that panic attacks A astronaut is trained to handle such situations for a long time before going to space Even Homer Simpson behave better then this Maybe this video is for audiences with low intelligence who do not understand such things,1
28 December 2013,Empty space,I just don t get it I ve watched Gravity twice now I m seeing the lovely long takes the exquisite vertiginous photography and the clever sound design I m receiving the magnificent special effects loud and clear But I m not getting anything else from the film When the praise for an artwork is so unanimously glowing you find yourself either wanting to love it or inclined to hate it But with Gravity for me it s worse than that I find it mediocre It s a classy space based smash em up for those who couldn t bear to admit enjoying J J Abrams Star Trek movies The film is written by the director s son Jonas Cuar n The story concerns a rookie engineer Ryan Stone a solid nappy free Sandra Bullock who we meet being guided through a Hubble mission by old hand Matt Kowalski a woefully miscast George Clooney going full Buzz Lightyear Soon the news comes over the radio that a cloud of debris is racing toward their position as fast as a high speed bullet as opposed to a sluggish bullet 90 minutes of spinning dancing chaos ensues Alfonso Cuar n proved in 2006 with Children of Men that he could push the boundaries of action cinema whilst also portraying interesting characters in a rich narrative Gravity does the action stuff brilliantly but the script is a B movie stinker and the characters are well like film stars playing astronauts Dotted throughout the film is beautiful imagery but it s either irrelevant Ryan curling into a floating foetal position or accompanied by Clooney verbally informing us it s beautiful These characters make the sight of the sunrise bland Imagine the zero gravity scenes from 2001 A Space Odyssey stretched to an entire film Albeit with more explosions and a lot more gasping Kubrick was attempting to depict the complacency of humankind how technology had drained the awe from our species I m not sure what the Cuar ns are up to here beyond giving us a very elaborate and expensive tech demo Are they simply trying to make us experience a visceral thrill or is there something deeper Something about the way we humans are forever spinning away and towards each other Alas father and son are only here to elaborate on the physical realm not the psychological philosophical or spiritual For that reason I can t see this pure cinema experience being one that will improve on the small screen,5
22 June 2014,The Worst Case Scenario,In many ways this reminded me of the film Wall E and not really because of the space link For most of the film there is hardly any speech and we are stuck with just two characters trying to survive a disaster This makes it a challenging watch to get into but clearly most people do manage to get through this challenge Let s face it this film is about two things 1 The visuals The whole film looks gorgeous with incredibly real shots of the Earth from space and various space craft Perhaps the most clever thing is the fact they managed to nail the views making it really feel like the astronauts were being flung around helplessly 2 is the thriller aspect of it It takes only a few minutes before disaster strikes and the rest of the film is a desperate race for survival You spend the whole film suffering along with the characters as you will them to survive and it takes until the last 30 seconds before you actually discover if they do or not The danger of having it all set in space the whole film focusing on one event is that of limited character There is just about enough time to develop the two leads especially Sandra Bullock s character It s just enough to make you care if they survive but actually you realise you still know virtually nothing about them at the end It is a credit to Sandra Bullock and George Clooney that they make the thinly stretched characters come to life The other problem with this is that though it goes for realism the events that happen are very unlikely Yes everything in the film could happen but the likelihood of it all happening at the same time is incredibly slim It is literally the very worst scenario that could possibly happen in space Fortunately though the sheer spectacle and thrill of the film mean you can pretty much see past the few issues A tense but enjoyable watch,8
28 May 2014,"Novel approach to the 'stranded in space' genre, unlike anything you've seen before",STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning Ryan Sandra Bullock and Matt George Clooney are two astronauts working on a space station whilst trying to juggle their respective emotional baggage All is going smoothly only for a big disaster to strike and the pair finding themselves desperately trying to get to safety When Ryan finds herself stranded on her own as the less experienced explorer she must use all her wits in a desperate struggle for survival Alfonso Cuaron s short critically acclaimed space drama plunges us straight in to the action from the start slowing closing in on our two main characters who we are forced to make a connection with on the basis of some piecemeal small talk as they go about their business with the famous performers playing them relying on their assured seasoned on screen personas that they ve each developed over many years with Clooney s smooth talking wise cracking man s man approach coupled with Bullock s hard ass cynical girl in a man s world thing Shortly after we feel all settled in the realization slowly dawns on the characters and the audience that something s wrong and the tension sets in and we feel as though we are in with these people as they are forced to rely on their instinctive human ingenuity to survive Interjected between the various seat edge moments our heroes are left merely to wonder aimlessly but as they do they and we are witness to some truly breath taking cinematography of the vast spacial glacier and the outstanding grand space station leaving the wow factor on more than one level At some point Bullock becomes stranded from her companion and forced to survive on her own as the tension and the stakes start to rise that little bit higher Somehow in the space of under an hour and a half you are left feeling as though your senses have been taken on a visceral mind bending ride where by the end it s become genuinely nerve wracking as to whether she ll survive even though inside we re pretty sure Alfonso Cuaron has crafted an original novel picture that takes a well trodden format but delivers it in a way that you really haven t seen before Clooney and Bullock are an effective double act even when they re not actually on screen together and it deserved to win the awards and get the acclaim it did,10
26 October 2013,Gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time. Alfonso Cuarón challenges the entire industry to make original films. Truly Magnificent.,Gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time Alfonso Cuar n challenges the entire industry to make original films Truly Magnificent Cuar n decides to compose the film from a series of incredibly long takes Because of this it is nearly impossible to not be captivated The camera s lens essentially becomes the audience s perspective causing viewers to look on as if they were drifting throughout space with the characters in the film A truly intimate choice for cinematography that is executed brilliantly Cuar n takes a great risk with not only making a 91 minute film but essentially conveying that the film is a true minute to minute ratio of what the audience is actually seeing The story clearly takes place over a several hour time period but is conveyed as if what the audience is watching is real time with the exception of a handful of jump cuts Cuar n takes a bold move and succeeds in essentially tricking the audience and changing their sense of time to further entrance the viewers There is only one critique i can give the film the visuals were so beautiful innovative magnificent and close to perfection than any movie ever made that the emotional dialogue literally couldn t keep up with the visuals During the scenes where dialogue is supposed to hit the film s themes home with the audience it simply cannot Though the themes are still very simple and obvious they are not as powerful as Cuar n intended them to be The audience was probably predicted to cry aloud during some line deliveries by Bullock but could not due to the fact that they were still in complete shock at what they just witnessed Gravity is a combination of modern technology and classic story Gravity is a testimony that original films still exist Brilliant,9

28 August 2021,Gravity,Gravity is the latest in science fiction feature films a thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar n that will have your heart racing and your breath held for most of the film Gravity toys with your emotions from minute one juxtaposing the beauty and serenity of space with its impending danger and destruction The film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and tells the story of two astronauts and their fight to get back to Earth after the destruction of their space shuttle Bullock plays the role of Dr Ryan Stone a medical engineer on her first expedition to space with Matt Kowalski played by Clooney a veteran and the more experienced of the two Bullock s acting is wonderful as she shared strong and true emotions with the audience despite the fact that for most of the film she only has herself or Matt a man her character isn t very well acquainted with to talk to What set this film apart are the special effects With a budget of 100 million about 80 per cent of the production was done in CG more than James Cameron s Avatar to create a visually stunning film Viewing the beauty of Planet Earth from space is what captivates you for most of the film with the help of 3D technology designed and added in post production under the supervision of Chris Parks giving an amazing depth to the film The work producers put into bringing space to life is phenomenal not to mention the light box with over 4 000 LED bulbs that had to be created invented even to film the actors faces inside their astronaut helmets Gravity shares similarities with traditional tales of determination to return home and survival The Odyssey and Castaway come to mind But in space this narrative takes on a new perspective The theme of perseverance is written all over this movie with Stone questioning her ability to keep fighting to look death in the face and either go on or give up This is a story about going against all odds when the entire universe is against you There are several hints of a rebirth theme as well with the astronauts hanging from the space shuttle with their lifelines like fetuses with their umbilical cords Look out for the scene partway through the film with Bullock floating in a C shape fetal position and remember the way astronauts have to relearn to walk and gain strength in their muscles upon returning to Earth like a child All these instances suggest a Kubrick like interest in demonstrating the evolution and vulnerability of human life united with the scenes of confronting death Gravity is at the top of the list where the Oscars are concerned with ten nominations tied for the lead with American Hustle including a nomination for Best Picture Even astronaut Buzz Aldrin gave the film positive reviews and he told the Hollywood Reporter that he s happy Gravity was made and hopes it will stimulate the public to encourage advancements in space technology I think with a movie like this and all the recent press from Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield we re taking one small step in the right direction,9
1 July 2020,Feeling sorry for those who missed the entire point of the film,All the 1 star reviews from people massacring this for scientific inaccuracies and genius physics students crying about space not being represented correctly I feel sorry for you Did it ever cross your mind that this is actually a FICTION MOVIE and not a documentary do you look for inaccuracies when looking at a painting in a gallery would it be such a betrayal to your intelligence to watch a movie that yes takes place in space letting go of your expectations science education representation of the Genre which it s a drama film and everything you have pre determined to be the correct way this movie should be and actually try to be open to the experience if you give it a shot you might change your mind Cuar n is brave enough NOT to be scientifically accurate he is an ARTIST It s a visually stunning cinematic experience that keeps you on the edge for the entire duration of the film It is directed to invoke the feeling of loneliness and helplessness in an unprecedented way It brings out a surprising range of emotions all along the way It s not a space movie It is a piece of art and as such it is stunningly executed,10
4 December 2013,Wow! a visually stunning film; this is what 3D is for.,This is a film that was bound to do well Bullock and Clooney both big draw names and both very talented actors popular and with appeal for both serious and comedic roles They had good chemistry on screen despite limited contact but mainly Bullock shines on her own for the majority of the film and other than that the majority of anything happening you just have their faces and their voices and still the film carries weight in terms of gripping the audience I can t remember the last time I was in a cinema when people were so quiet I barely wanted to bite my popcorn I think people were stunned Difficult to review without spoilers but the premise of the film is well known people in space they run into difficulties Apollo 13 was similar problem after problem tense like a roller coaster This was particularly tense and gripping as a it s in 3D so everything is more vividly shown and b Bullock has a way of drawing you in to her little world and c you can imagine how mind bogglingly scary it would be very easily Being in space outside in it free floating alone Brrrrr Bullock had worked hard for this role she had worked out A LOT and it must have been physically draining as a lot of the scenes were weightless and unless they used CGI which I think they did a bit very well and or some very clever wire work she was doing long scenes in free fall anti gravity plane flights difficult She did it brilliantly and convincingly and you could really believe it was all happening to her The plot is very slim but there is a little back story and in the absence of lots of varied events and dialogue and back and forth there is pathos existential epiphanies and some really touching moments Sounds are made use of music a great score and soundtrack and attention to detail in the sound effects There s no glamour and emotionally Bullock was very exposed without anything to hide behind just raw emotion and fear and struggle I got a bit teary at one point I will admit The real star of the show was Gaia Planet Earth however they depicted it whether it was real space shots or CGI or whatever it was magnificent it added the spectacle and the backdrop to a lot of very close in action sequences and the infinite reaches of space were engrossing when you got to look out it felt huge in the cinema with the 3D glasses on really beautiful I haven t really appreciated 3D much before but in Gravity it was necessary and it had a point to it In the confined space of the space pods on the station the effect was so realistic as to be there and some of the scenes were shot out of Bullock s eyes making you right there in the action Little details like that the use of the lens as eye things ending up on the lens to give the impression of intimacy and being there the use of reflection very arty in places and the whole visual of the film was one of the best I ve seen The CGI in this film the 3D effects though were incredible mind blowing a special effect was tear drops floating in front of the viewers eye the lens tiny details were what made this film despite the scale of it It had the same visual effect as remember the first time you saw T2 or Matrix Like that Whilst I thought this film was superb in terms of visuals stunning and very artistic and the performance by Sandra Bullock was especially raw and worthy of accolade I can t see that Gravity would translate well to DVD unless you had a screen the size of your wall It is a big screen film a 3D film and without those two things I don t think the impact of it would be as great and so it has limited appeal I don t expect its a film you could or would want to see over and over again either and once you know what happens the tension is probably gone,8
17 December 2019,Excelent movie!,Loved the movie makes you feel that it s happening to you,10
9 October 2013,"An Outstanding Military Film, that's Pitch Perfect",Background on myself I have been an IMDb user for over three years I am from the Ohio area but I support all mid west arts film and creative types I saw this film in Chicago at the historic Wilmette Theater and I REALLY enjoyed both great movies from Monterey Media this year that were coincidentally films made in Michigan including The Citizen and Approaching Midnight I am admitting to being slightly biased as a mid west film scene supporter but praise has to be given to intense work from such amazing MoTown Filmmakers As for this one I don t want to give away any twist endings that the trailer almost gives away but the film is stellar I also loved Cinematographer Carl Ballou s work on this movie it s like The Thin Red Line very Emmanuel Lubezki like kind of reminded me of Tree of Life too The movies soundtrack was very omniscient and I have been watching the very cool works of composer James Stonehouse or a long time who created a track on this film that was a borderline of Hanz Zimmer and John Ottman who scored the Usual Suspects Which is funny because when I was watching the film at the theater in the suburban Chicago area the theater had an awesome 5 1 setup that fantastically captured the elements of the soundtrack,10

24 October 2013,"Not great, don't waste you're money",I was very excited to see this movie especially after reading some very promising critics reviews I know my bad that this was something of a cinematic event approaching the level of Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey While Gravity does behold some very good technical achievements it falls to earth with a silent deafening thud in terms of story and especially in the script Like so many other hyped up visual cinematic spectaculars of the computer age the star of the show is the effects while it s stars through no fault of their own are left to try to lift a simple rather boring narrative into the stratosphere to solidify the drama of the spectacle The film looks clean and beautiful as one would envision if jettisoned into outer space and the 3D effects are truly in your face However despite a valiant performance from Sandra Bullock the drama often gets convoluted and the dialogue is dotted with many a cringeworthy line All I can say is before you spend the extra bucks on seeing Gravity in 3D and AVX don t say I didn t warn you,5

13 March 2014,Sound Travels In Space,So you ve sat down in the dark theater or maybe in the comfort of your own home The movie quickly brings you into the world of space where no sound can be heard As the movie goes on you realize that the lack of sound is actually the reason you are drawn in more and attached to what little sounds you do hear The characters are brought to life with organic sounds heard through their suits The heartbeats and breaths they take make you hang by the edge of your seat Will they take their last breath or will they have just enough oxygen to take one more breath and make it to the destination The use of sound in this film is what really drew me to want to watch this film Ultimately I would recommend it to anyone The story line is strong and the character development has a good pace They don t give it to you all at once but in gradual stages If you haven t seen this movie go out and by it right now You won t be disappointed,10

16 October 2013,A Weightless Wonder.,I am writing this review after a space mission Gravity a film about how a space mission goes awry post an unprecedented accident is undoubtedly one of the finest films to have released in recent times Most if all movies tell a story to which you are treated from a distant place But this movie will take you along with it into outer space and that IS really where the director and his crew succeed Alfonso Cuaron who apparently once dreamed of becoming an astronaut has shattered all generic constraints and has delivered a cult exciting and suave gem of a movie Earth shattering special effects provide solid foundation to the script The stunning reality of the work will leave you and your thoughts floating long after you have left the cinema hall The stupendous finesse rendered to the detailing of each and every of the few objects in space is something to be experienced in 3D in a cinema hall From the Earth to the cords of the parachute to the logo on the space suit everything is impeccable Ms Bullock s performance is one to be applauded For she taken this to a whole new level With every tear drop that floats towards you the actress adds new dimension to this movie and sans her Gravity would be unthinkable Clooney too impresses in his role as the ever so charming mission head With virtually no other actor this movie rides on the brilliance of these two With some spellbinding cinematography and soul stirring music gravity comes as a wholesome experience and will definitely satisfy any movie lover And finally we must thank Sir Issac Newton for without his discovery the world wouldn t have been graced by this movie This space mission will without doubt leave you pondering over the gargantuan and imminent nature of space and mankind s humble attempts to visit it Take a bow Mr Cuaron,10

4 October 2013,Alfonso has made his mark in Cinema History,So I just finished watching the much anticipated film Gravity Oh My God What a breath of fresh air literally Gravity was easily one of the most intense movies I had ever seen Here s my breakdown No Spoilers Sandra Bullock gave a strong performance throughout the whole film The sound design was THROUGH THE ROOF Saw it in XD and 3D so of course they have nicer surround sound than the average screen but still the sound design was awesome The Cinematography was inspirational with holding long shots in scenes of suspense and balanced it out with beautiful shots of the Earth and the Sun in Space The Special Effects were realistic enough to make me forget that I was even watching a movie Technology blows my mind every year and Visionary Directors like Alfonso Cuar n himself knew exactly what he was doing The story itself An incredible journey That s all I can say without spoiling I wouldn t be surprised if this film wins Best Director Best Cinematography Best Actress in Leading Role and even BEST PICTURE Great film I highly recommend it 9 7 10,10
8 November 2013,A modern classic,What can I say about this film Well it was incredible If you haven t seen it yet you better hurry on down to your local theatre at once because this is an experience that is intended for the big screen I was very lucky only 2 other people in the theatre with me I viewed it at non peak times and this just added to the integrity of the film The second the first frame comes into focus you really have to appreciate the aspiring atmosphere and view of Earth from space The movie is fairly short with a run time of just 90 mins However I felt that if the run time had been extended there would have been too much dialogue and unnecessary sequences which would distract from the overall experience I really can t admire Sandra Bullock enough for her outstanding performance in this role and I fell she performs even better and incorporates more emotion into her performance than in her Oscar winning film The blind side The visuals are something that needs to be seen in 3D The depth is incredible Alfonso Cuaron does not attempt to use any cheesy pop out 3D spectacles but instead uses subtle elements to really place the viewer in the moment Such might include a small crew floating past the screen or a water droplet If you thought Apollo 13 looked amazing just you wait Clooney is also good for his role But what s important here is the film was pulled off to a exquisite extent and incorporates loss hope and the beauty of life all in one short package I will be buying this in 3D bluray upon release but as I have previously mentioned you must see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it for what it is I d like to see Star Wars VII top this visually,8

25 August 2019,Spaced in Space,I ll give this a three star just because I m a sucker for space movies There was no character development in the movie and George Clooney acted like he had just stopped in the studio for 20 minutes on the way to Malibu Sandra Bullock looked past her prime and her obvious facework looked puffy in space She was not into this movie and acted like she was just reading her lines Also too old for the part The special effects were not bad albeit repetitive The premise of the movie wasn t very believable Irwin Allen would have at least set you up for the preposterous plot with some deep voiced B actor lending it credibility down at control The name of the movie also doesn t make sense because gravity has very little to do with the plot I like the name though This movie would have been a lot more credible with lesser known actors that actually looked like astronauts and at least two should have ate in in spectacular fashion Even with a bit of a weak plot this movie should have been at least a 6 5 with cheaper actors If I gon on any more I m going to lower my rating of this movie so I ll stop here,3
2 June 2014,(3D) Experience,There is a reason the movie is called Gravity There is a reason for a lot of things in this movie And while you can blame it for being too technical and being too thin on actual story you can also say that there are clich s in this it handles all that in a fashion that shouldn t matter to the viewer if the viewer can get excited about what the movie is really about Survival is not easy and while it does exaggerate a few things a bit it stays as real to facts as possible for a fictional movie But it never felt too fictional putting you right into the action and drama Do things happen one after another and might seem rational implausible Yes they do but again the experience is too good to be dismissing it like that After the movie ended and I have to stress out the vote rating is for the 3D version of the movie only I was unable to get up Gravity you say,10
13 October 2013,Beautiful story about the personal lives of 3 astronauts during a terrible time.,many people want to say it wont have a story because there is no way you can fit 90 minutes of space into a film BUT It did have a story it goes into the Drama adventure Genre Adventure being a journey People say there s no compelling story but small spoiler the journey is them going back to Earth The hobbit s story among a few others interlaced within is them making their way to a destination with all the mishaps that happen during the trip there are four types of literary conflict Man V Man Man V Self Man V Situation Nature Man V Social This Film is Man V Self and Man V Situation Nature The reason it s so foreign to many people is that the most common in films lately is Man V Man This one however is not man V Man in any way this is a film where it s best to watch it in 3D and imagining yourself in their shoes 3D because when people walk in space they feel disoriented because there s no true orientation of X Y and Zedd axis and the 3D mixed with the camera floating around freely helps put you in THEIR place I saw it in 2D but it just doesn t work for this film I LOVED this movie I watched it twice once on my own and another with a group because after them seeing my excitement after the film they were compelled to see if I was right and They all agreed this movie was awesome TECHNICAL They didn t bend the real laws of physics in this film at least not in an immediately noticeable way The cinematography is brilliant Color is amazing Acting rocks don t expect action when it s not needed but don t expect to be disappointed when there is action the score ROCKS Steven Price did an AMAZING job with the soundtrack filling the gaps of would be near silent audio sound editing is brilliant I don t want to give a whole lot away about the feel of the film but the underwater no air sound was done extremely well I was jaw dropped through the majority of the film there was never a dull moment and when you put it all together you get 15 minute cuts some entire scenes are done with just 1 or 3 takes but don t expect it to feel like a tripod shot you ll hardly notice and even forget that there wasn t many cuts the point i m trying to make here is that ignore the trailer the actual film itself is one of the best of this year and one of the best from and for many years to come it s up there the boundaries in every sense has been pushed I will be wanting to watch this again VERY soon,10

16 January 2019,A Visually Dazzling Emotional Survival Ride,7 October 2013 Gravity begins in a way suggestive of cautionary film producers of movies that offer drastically new unknown potential hedging their bets on an unknown audience by incorporating brief written explanations of what actual outer space is like or perhaps that introduce some dazzle as a way to ensure captivating the audience at the start of a movie like Star Trek The Motion Picture 1979 that spent time offering fascinating tidbits of tantalizing visions of outer space and the Starship Enterprise or like even Event Horizon 1997 that offered up the almost by now obligatory space shots of weightless objects spinning in space for the audience s vicarious space experience Additionally George Clooney was provided with an almost by now clique dialog seemingly formulaic in the same manner as Space Cowboys 2000 And whether or not the Executive Decision 1996 plot element was added as a psychological twist ploy and was even technically accurately portrayed was necessary or not is debatable Like with Avatar 2009 Wall e 2008 Life of Pi 2012 or Titanic 1997 Gravity presents its audience with a sharply breaking visual cinematic experience which may in time soften its innovative impact with future generations But it can t be argued that this huge spectacular survival story bombards its audience with new amazing visions of space travel and space debris that have not been seen on film that delight and awe Interestingly this movie resembles the action version of an earlier lonely space station movie Love 2007 and uses the thrilling action visuals somewhat like Apollo 18 2011 used its fresh and well edited space dialog and space behavior that captured the audience s attention Gravity retains the same sense of eerie foreign exhilaration of the classic 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 by adhering to the stark ambiance and the potentially frightening personal isolation and dynamically different physical environmental effects of outer space or the monsters of the frozen tundra of The Thing 1982 or duplicating the psychological trying experience of attempting survive one night in a simple haunted hotel room of 1408 2007 or the technical mysteries and dangers in science of Splice 2010 Overall Gravity like The Andromeda Strain 1971 presents on screen an amazing compelling dramatic science fiction scenario that is also closely related to the personal survival theme from Touching The Void 2004 that brings its audience into personally experiencing a prolonged harrowing life struggle event It can t be argued that this movie brings into full explosive and thrilling life the wondrous terrors of outer space into the darkened auditorium of the theater It is Sandra Bullock s performance a little ways into the movie that really shines here ignoring the early dialog like Clooney s that doesn t seem logically suited to the reality of the situation that allows one to ignore the unlikely events that occur written for dramatic sake and make this movie into one of powerful presentation of human frailty and courage from a deeply personal place,8

5 August 2020,Great experience,This is more of an experience than a traditional film The narrative itself is barebones Yet the visuals are captivating and we are pulled along for a wild ride We feel the protagonist s dire situation and hope she gets to safety It really gets intense at times There is not much dialogue or character development but that s the point,9
7 October 2013,Technically flawless and one of the greatest cinema experiences ever offered,Disclaimer This review was based on an IMAX 3 D version of the film If you re reading this review and have yet to take off into orbit with Gravity you should stop reading now and find the biggest screen available in 3 D and partake in what is likely to be one of if not the most technically flawless films ever made for Gravity make no doubt about it is an experience literally out of this world and a cinema experience that will perhaps forever rank as one of the best I have been lucky enough to partake in Any regular to J and E would be more than familiar with my advance hype and keenness for Gravity to hit our cinema screens so without further ado I can say this I told you so I don t get to say that to often so allow me my indulgence there and as a repeat go see Gravity now on the biggest screen available to you It would be possible to rant on for hours on end about just how marvelous Alfonso Cuaron s space thriller is as a film making achievement and CGI touchstone the computer generated imagery on display here is scarily realistic Gravity open s with one of the most audacious and spectacular tracking shots ever committed to film and from there it continues to push the boundaries of what has been done on screen before It s clear that many pain staking hours of thought and commitment went into every minute and every shot of this film from the construction of space tears through to every star in the vast open universe It really is a joy to behold and no doubt a benchmark for filmmakers to now take off from All this technical wizardry would have fallen somewhat by the way side if Cuaron could not get a team to hold the movie together but thankfully his duo of Bullock in a role that will be featuring in awards season and the ever charming silver fox George Clooney deliver Clooney offers his usual roguish charm and ever calm demeanor but it really is Bullocks film when it comes to the acting stakes and she really does give it her all Bullock s performance gets under your skin so that every bump near miss or floating through a shuttle will slowly feel like it is you the viewer experiencing these things which in all honesty can be a pretty scary thing when you are hurtling towards a space station at the speed of a bullet With 3 paragraphs of praise behind me it now must be said that while Gravity as a technical point of view could be graded at nothing short of a perfect 5 stars there is something amiss in the film that stops it from reaching absolute perfection despite it being just to tough to pinpoint as a definite what that is It could be any range of things from some script conveniences through to some misguided character driven scenes but really these are slight missteps in a movie universe that is totally and enthrallingly enjoyable for every last minute of its running time Gravity upon conclusion is one of the year s best movies a film that will undoubtedly live long in the history of film and filmmaking You have to be willing to take the ride with the film but it s a ride that you ll want to go on again and again and with that Gravity deserves every last award that will come at it like hurling space debris come this awards season 4 and a half fire extinguishers out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out www jordanandeddie wordpress com,9
24 September 2018,Fantastic sci-fi with awe inspiring visuals,Amazingly shot by Mexican Alphonso Cuarran Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as an astronaut who suffers a problem in orbit and then must return back home any way possible The cinematography and direction is amazing and the shots of the planet are humbling and scary at the same time Of course I know all this is CGI but it looks so real you d be shocked George Clooney also stars but he s barely in the film Bullock is more than competent and carries the film though it is the visuals and the sequences of chaos that stay with you,
25 May 2020,It is a visual treat 😮,Gravity is one of the most thrilling movie of the decade great visuals and an excellent cinematography of 3 time oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki There is not so much in this movie to enjoy but it will keep you on your toe till the end Journey of a single task to land on earth alive I got goosebumps all over my body when background score begins i feel it every time when I see Gravity s posters Just awesome Sandra did a great job Clooney s appearance wasn t satisfying too short but he did great too Must watch for those who loves a super gripping and thrilling space adventure,9

1 January 2014,"I don't get it, I really really don't!",OK I do not get the praise this movie is getting In short it has no plot get from point A to point B the characters are unbelievable and clich and have totally unrealistic relationships with one another eg they work together as astronauts which takes a lot of time of working and training together and a lot of team work but Clooney doesn t even know where Sandra is from or has she any kids the acting isn t awful but it s not really good either Sandra s monologues are ridiculous the physics are way off the scenario is ridiculously unbelievable I could go on and on The one thing this movie has going for it is the visual effects which are some of the best I have ever seen ever If you must see this movie see it on a big 3d screen but leave your IQ at the door I just think it s way way overrated and dumbed down,5

15 November 2013,Almost Perfect,The plot is very simple don t expect much in the way of twists and character development They are already astronauts they have been through the training to get this far Usually I dislike Clooney his charm and the way he stares at people makes me distrustful but as an astronaut this works very well Before I was indifferent to Sandra Bullock now I m in love A few people have criticised her character she panics she does weird stuff Given her situation this is completely understandable she had my sympathy and admiration all the way through This may be the best looking film I have ever seen most of it is CGI and it works very well When Ryan Bullock is tumbling around moving away from the camera you can really see the depth This is the only film I can recommend 3D over 2D Usually I can t stand 3D fast moving and close up objects look terrible and jittery and ruin ant immersion I had There were a few shots like this in this film especially with the debris you ve seen this in the trailers coming towards the audience it felt a bit like a gimmick Some of the physics was a bit wrong but to notice that I had to put a higher standard on this film than any other film I have seen Overall it didn t make much difference while watching it Afterwards discussing the physics jut added an extra level of fun to this film Some of the physics made me quite excited the sound of the tools vibrating through the suits was beautifully done I was twanging my headphone cable on the bus ride home just to hear those vibrations again And another moment with Ryan and a fire extinguisher me happier than it should Newton s third law This film was something special to view on a large screen in 3D I m going to see it again,9
16 December 2013,The Way 3D Should Be Done.,This has to be the best exhibition around in showing what the usually pointless 3D filming can actually produce If you are fed up of paying extra to go and watch a 3D film only to find that at one point through out the 90 minuet picture a fist might come out of the screen Gravity may be the film to restore your faith in the medium of 3D cinema I have avidly avoided any 3D screening of any film as it is usually just a way for money grabbing cinema companies to get an extra two pounds off you for some poorly made glasses However in gravity the visuals are truly breathtaking in fact some of the best parts of the film are the establishing shots of the earth which are truly stunning The visuals are clearly at the forefront of this film from the outset with the acting and plot taking a back seat however if you had worries that the plot simply consisted of Sandra Bullock floating around in space for an hour and a half it is far from that with some truly epic space disaster scenes in which the 3D is used yet even more effectively A must watch if only to see how 3D should be done,9

18 October 2013,"Good storyline, Excellent special effects",Saw the movie Gravity this afternoon since my wife didn t have any interest in seeing it I enjoyed it and give the storyline 3 out of 5 good and the special effects 5 out 5 excellent I saw in it digital 3D and it felt like I was floating in space above the earth incredible as a child of the 60 s that grew up interested in space still remember my mom getting me up to watch the us land on the moon and was interested in working for NASA when I grew up it was quite a thrill to be on what can be described as a 90 minute rocket ride of a movie I was amazed that the time went by so fast early in my career at Harris Corporation I was part of the team that designed and built the internal audio video communication systems for the ISS International Space Station so I was on the look out for Harris gear when Sandra Bullock was on the ISS but didn t see any hoping that the storyline in the movie never comes true though as that would be a tragedy worth the price to see in 3D on the big screen,8
13 October 2013,All hype,Locally this movie received excellent reviews I wanted to see it on a big screen rather than Netflix so I did In today s world of computer graphics these were nothing special The plot line was nothing special and in fact was quite predictable Ryan s whimpering was perhaps sexist and not commensurate with the training an astronaut even a medical doctor in the role of an astronaut and would not likely be sent into space with only one trained astronaut OK the writers are entitled to some license but I think the same results could have been attained with a more realistic portrayal of who we send into space at the cost of millions The bottom line for me is that it doesn t come close to the story special effects and intrigue of 2001 Gravity made me appreciate the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick who has yet to be topped or even equaled,5
2 January 2015,"It's a Movie, Folks, Not High-Brow Fiction",It s no spoiler to state at the outset that Gravity won no best script awards Why The writing is third rate Maybe even intentionally so Editing apparently left plot connections and with them story telling logic on the cutting room floor and you can count the clich d lines recycled from Westerns and lost at sea flicks But so what This movie features stunning visuals great special effects credible action a welcome touch of international politics and a pair of actors the camera plainly loves even in space suits And so did I Clooney plays a sensitive macho with style and notwithstanding the catty comments you ll read elsewhere on this review webpage Sandra Bullock deserved to win the Academy Award She s beautiful sure but she can also act with a decent range of emotion So don t see Gravity expecting to see Shakespeare or the Lunts or Helen Hayes or even the latest English biopic set in a countryside manor Go for a good time,10
28 March 2014,Science Project,This film was more like a science project than a story on the screen the characters were so flat that when things happen to them despite the overly dramatic music the viewer could really care less And when when the ending finally arrives I can t imagine why anyone would cheer It was just so blah First the film opens with some superficial dialogue aimed at building character for both Clooney and Bullock As the story progresses the blah dialog continues and really adds nothing to the story or the characters because it s so forced Later in the movie the director makes an attempt at bringing the initial dialog full circle to create a bond between the characters but it again feels so forced that it makes you want to simply hit that fast forward button to get to the predictable ending,3
22 October 2013,"If you only ever watch one 3D movie, make it this one!",Absolutely and completely absorbing from the first moment If you have seen the trailers trust me in 3D the whole of those scenes not just the excerpts are pretty scary I am not an astronaut I have never been in zero gravity but it looked pretty authentic to me This is 3D the way it was meant to be employed and CGI used intelligently The good 3D CGI movies are in the minority The whole crew should be remembered for this movie and this movie should be the bench mark It was not OTT they got it exactly right Excellent acting by Sandra Bullock very believable performance and I hope she gets an award for this George Clooney s best acting role was The American but he was pretty good here even though he was typecast Alfonso Cuar n Orozco good job mate I hope you get the Oscar,10
6 October 2013,Slow but steady,I did not put much expectation for this movie in the beginning Firstly hats off to the Cuaron brothers for their original story Its not the usual and common science fiction story you watch everyday such as asteroid alarm alien attacks and war between two planets The story focuses on life on space how unpredictable it could be how helpless we are outside the atmosphere of earth and gravity and also hope Secondly graphic was good and realistic I realized the team did a pretty good job on making the movements of objects and person as how it could be when there is no gravity acting on them Next acting Sandra Bullock gave her best since her performance in The Blind Side Sadly its not Oscar deserving She brought the role perfectly but not the emotions It seems not natural She failed to shine during breakdowns or when under pressure Well credits for her initiative to befriend astronaut Andy Coleman in order to understand their lifestyle in space George Clooney well his role can be clearly seen as supporting actor which did not suit him He is an astronaut so he could had been more serious and less romantic and funny maybe Nobody jokes when we are in the outer space Few mistakes here and there but great screenplay Finally then ending Few moments to the ending tend to be biased to make her survive It didn t take me long to realize that she will survive every single obstacle till the last Chinese capsule I would prefer if she died trying in the ending Shooting was completed in 2011 so i assume a lot of time was spent to edit and improve the visual effects Kudos to the team Overall i would give this movie 8 10 for the vast amount of effort put by the actors and staffs to produce this original and almost realistic piece of work Thank you,8
14 December 2013,Gravity's Big Miss was Important,It s big miss is the already admitted impossible let go of George Clooney s character Kowalski by Sandra Bullock s Character Dr Stone When Dr Stone let s go of Kowalski s hand Kowalski would not have floated off into the wild black yonder he would have stayed exactly where he was And in fact there was no reason to let go of Kowalski s hand all she needed to do was pull him back to the tether line because he s weightless It seems that it s no big deal to the people who like this film a lot Well I liked the movie too but there are a lot of other ways that Kowalski could have died in the movie and any one of them would not have been as dumb as the one they used What if in Gone with the Wind Scarlett floated down the staircase instead of walking down the staircase But since this is a space movie such a dumb impossibility is forgiven,7

9 October 2013,Gravity without plot.,I was not disappointed with the CGI effects but was TOTALLY disappointed with a story line if you could find it This was CASTAWAY in space without a plot There were some exciting moments which made you do Ohhhh s and whoa s On the whole they were far and few between Clooney was his charming self and Bullock did a great job making her role semi believable When you think of Ron Howards version of space Apollo 13 which was true He did an amazing job even with the fact he had reality as his governor This movie was fiction with all the room in the world or out of this world for story development and still crashed in that area Its fiction for God sake come up with something new Why did they go through all the time needed to create all the exceptional visual effects if you were going to trash a story plot Seems like something Spielberg would do these days because he does stand on ceremony Wait for DVD unless you need to get out of the house Everything in consideration this movie was way overrated,5
26 January 2014,The best Space movie!,A superbly acted and directed space sci fi thriller Visually a stunning extravaganza with Sandra Bullocks superb acting and Emmanuel Lubezki spectacular cinematography The critics are right it is probably the best film this year and actually a 2001 Space Odyssey of the new millennium Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is stuck with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski after being hit by a space disaster Have you ever wondered what space is like what it is like to be in zero gravity etc All the answers lie in a viewing of this film preferably on an IMAX screen The only regret I have is that we don t have any IMAX here in India Nevertheless this film is not just a film but an experience Visually driven films tend to lack proper story telling and in many cases a proper story and in almost all cases no remember able performance But this film is different as much as it relies upon its superior bench marked visuals it is a plot and character driven story It might lack character development but there was no need for it though George Clooney s character is developed well enough whereas Sandra bullock s crowning performance is probably her career best Alfonso Cuar n waited for the right technology which was delivered to it by Cameron s Avatar and Alfonso implemented it to perfection by combining it with his long shots compelling direction and calculative writing Along with extraordinary visuals the film also features an excellent soundtrack and it is my pick for the Academy awards this year I was very disappointed when Emmanuel Lubezki was snubbed by the academy for the Tree of Life but this year it is impossible to beat him Direction Extraordinarily compelling and top notch Script Screenplay Calculative and Strong Has just the right thrills and character development as deemed necessary Nothing feels thrown inn or forced Acting Sandra s best probably an Oscar is on the way if not for Cate George was great as well Music A sure Oscar An extremely excellent score and very very well executed When the film ends you want to see more you feel like I wish it was 3 to 4 hours long If you haven t seen this yet better go and watch it till its in theaters it is not a film meant to be downloaded by torrents or watched on DVD or even Blu Ray,8
12 October 2020,Boring,It was so boring I am sorry that I watched this movie,3
5 March 2014,What a shame! a to-the-point review:,As most have said in a nutshell all of the focus on special effects and cinematography left for a neglected storyline What a shame Just watched it last night after much anticipation and wondered where the tension had gone that was exhibited in the trailers It wasn t gripping it didn t make me care about the characters a lot was confusing to the layman who doesn t know anything about space engineering the list goes on Best actor was Ed Harris who opened the film as Houston couldn t see him but he certainly sounded the most natural a great contrast to every line by uttered by Clooney too bad as I like Bullock and I m fine with Clooney when he plays Ocean style characters The only success if I were forced to list one again apart from the special effects which like others have mentioned lost the awe surrounding them anyway after having grown accustomed to the space views deeper into the film is that I did feel the exposure and the vulnerability of floating in the vast black emptiness of space effectively emphasized by the contrast demonstrated upon re entry into the relatively safe interior of a spacecraft or space station But they blew it with the lack of character development not making me feel any anxiety for Bullock or Clooney in this capacity only for myself were I put into their situation Again a shame Instead of being engrossed in Bullock s storyline or performance we found ourselves speculating upon why her hair didn t stand up while inside the cabin in the absence of gravity and other trivialities Basically they left the plot line in the dust This would have been better as a documentary about space rather than incorporating a fictional screenplay Glad we didn t purchase it on Blu Ray not worth a re watch It s not AWFUL but it s boring so earning at most a 3,3
17 February 2014,"A Rip-Roaring Crush of Emotions, Gravity Doesn't Let Up Until the Credits Crawl",A fascinating blend of opposing extremes Gravity is gripping and white knuckle intense from the word go but also unexpectedly intimate as a character study Many of its successes are due to an excellent application of sound design which flutters from loud echoey destruction to the sudden stillness of panicked breathing amidst the silence of a total vacuum Outstanding visual effects up the ante a few more notches expertly visualizing the helpless chaos of a rapidly compounding disaster in low orbit in a way that s both picturesque and graphically terrifying That the rules and environments are all so foreign and unfamiliar only makes it easier for the viewing audience to forget that so much of what we re seeing is CG The underlying moral is more than a little blunt and a few laws might get bent along the way but to zero in on those is to ignore the focus of the ride itself A cinematic roller coaster in the truest sense of the word it s one of the most physically suspenseful experiences I ve ever sat through,9

17 December 2021,Damsel in distress BS,This film is visually stunning but the story is pretty weak The biggest problem is that Sandra Bullock s character is unfortunately painted as confused and weak needing George Clooney to come to the rescue Why Why not make Bullock a strong and capable astronaut capable of thinking and working her way into a solution like Matt Damon in The Martian Because then you wouldn t need superstar Clooney I guess After watching a YouTube video by a real astronaut who flew on both the Shuttle and the space station my opinion of this film dropped He talked about how some of the best and most experienced astronauts are women and this film does a disservice to them He also points out that the science isn t all that great either especially the entire premise of the space station being smashed into pieces etc,5
19 September 2013,"Great visuals, boring movie",I was super excited when I heard I got tickets to see this at a free 3 D screening I am a huge sci fi fan and I love movies that take place in space I went in expecting what I had read in other reviews a great sci fi thriller I guess I did not see the same movie as them I saw a movie with almost nothing to go on except Sandra Bullocks emotions It relies way too much on the viewer putting themselves in her shoes She is an incredible actress but just showing her getting emotional and freaking out for an hour and a half is not a good movie You barely learn anything about the characters The ending is predictable The only thing this movie has going for it is the visuals and the sound The view of Earth and the shuttles and stations look great This could have been a much better movie I get that they were probably trying to make it very claustrophobic and wanted you to ride the same stressful and emotional roller coaster as Bullock but it s hard to do when you re sitting in a comfy chair on Earth and barely know a thing about her character Don t expect an action packed thriller or even a smart sci fi that makes you think and you might like it Really this movie is barely sci fi I m glad I did not pay to see this Bottom line Fairly predictable boring way too often looks great,5
11 October 2013,a gripping & inspiring breathtaking experience. Afford to miss it at your own risk,Do you miss out being part of a life less exciting n boring then u better watch this heart wrenching depiction of survival amongst all odds This beautifully conceived story is not only just some gr8 visuals n breathtaking special effects thrown in It rises above that n gives us an inspiring tale of a lone human being left at the perils of an alien space n incoming debris of a satellite Its about how she survives n is helped by a friend n inner strong instinct how she fights all the demons in herself makes her way back to earth It really keeps you seated tightly in your cushioned seats n one can only exclaim in wow at the gorgeously picturised view of earth from up there Plus the special effects like the tears converting into bubbles devastation caused by the incoming debris n not to forget the confidence n the next to perfect booming voice of George Clooney with all the humor thrown in An awesome experience Will surely be counted as one of the forerunners in the list of inspiring tales a list that includes schindler s list etc Cant afford to miss it,9
11 October 2013,Breathing guide,Do we really breathe properly That s what I was thinking after I saw the movie I don t know maybe I was a little bit emotional after I saw the film of Alfonso Cuar n But I think I will not make a mistake if I state that living is a lot like breathing you have ups and downs and sometimes you enjoy it other times you can barely get through it With such a soulful movie in front of us we cannot stay indifferent From the first glimpse of our beautiful planet to the last shot of the sea shore we are engulfed in a spacious journey which endeavors in the bright and dark places of our inner and outer human universe In a broader aspect this is a story about our place in life and space and how we perceive it I m not really sure if I have seen a better performance by Sandra Bullock but I m pretty much convinced that it will not be the last of her magnificent reincarnations And George Clooney not only looked as the calmest person in the cosmos he convinced me that to be a parental figure you have to work hard and always act natural This is the best way to represent what is truly happening in your mind and heart Every breath of the main character Dr Ryan Stone is co experienced by the viewer No matter how calm or fearful her breathing is heartfelt because we all know what is fear and tranquility and how these two can change their places suddenly That is why I enjoyed every minute of this spectacle It was entertaining enlightening and rewarding A guide into finding the will to overcome yourself and live life as it is,9
1 March 2014,its simply out of this world',Im very disgust to a number of people who says that the plot is not good the plot story etc hello its probably because your not into this types of films The first time i watched the trailer it attracted me so quickly i told everyone around me to watch this movie Then i watched the movie boom it was perfect I don t know how but the overall making of the film such as the music the visual and sound effects etc engaged me as if i was floating with them in space experiencing all this tragic happenings I really like the sounds because it really does move u as an audience I hope Sandra bullocks win the Oscars my only suggestion is that when Sandra was talking about her daughter she could have showed a bit of tears in her eyes just to make it more emotional overall I recommend everyone to watch,10
13 October 2013,Might just be the best film of the year,As a HUGE fan of director Alfonzo Cuaron HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN which I consider the best film of the series CHILDREN OF MEN one of the best films of the last decade I d been looking forward to his outer space drama GRAVITY since it was announced Of course word of mouth from its film festival premieres was so incredibly good that it seemed like it couldn t possibly live up to this hype right Short answer YES IT DOES Synopsizing the film doesn t do it justice but it follows astronauts Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a first timer in space and Matt Kowalski a smooth talking chatterbox veteran who are forced to do whatever they can to survive together after a freak shower of debris destroys their shuttle in the most hostile environment that humankind has ever visited outer space That s really it The film unfolds in real time and thanks to Cuaron s vision and the talents of Bullock and Clooney and all of the technical staff GRAVITY is not only the best film of 2013 so far and will likely remain so it s also the most visually immersive and absorbing film I may have ever seen in my 36 years of remembering seeing films At a brisk but unrelentingly intense 90 minutes GRAVITY grabs you and it NEVER lets go The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas isn t just filled with dialogue and action that gets you from one moment to another It has surprises and a significant amount of heart as it becomes slowly less about just survival and more about living life What really does it though and this might be where the film might suffer on home video is the ASTONISHING use of 3D As opposed to 99 9999 of films that are shown in 3D nowadays which is just a shoddy post conversion so that the studio might squeeze a few more bucks out of the moviegoer Cuaron actually USES the 3D as part of his visual storytelling There are moments where you literally put your hands in front of your face in order to block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you This speaks more to the immersive feeling of the film than just about anything else other than the storyline performances cinematography effects and musical score by Steven Price because all of these things are incredibly well done Bullock EASILY gives the performance of her career here and Clooney does a brilliant job at keeping things grounded GRAVITY is not a very subtle film and it s not designed to be There aren t layers upon layers of commentary like CHILDREN OF MEN and there aren t subversive elements like in PRISONER OF AZKABAN This is cinematic storytelling without the veneer of having to be high minded It s pure cinema that will terrify you exhilarate you and absorb you like no other film in recent memory It s a great artist that knows when to cast aside pretense that isn t necessary and just tell a breathtaking story Cuaron is one of those rare artists and GRAVITY is one of those very rare films,10
8 October 2013,Gravity will pull you up!,Have you ever been to space I don t think so but Gravity will give you the opportunity to get the same experience like you do in space This space drama is one of the best space movies ever done With outstanding visual effects and awesome 3D effects this movie will let you see the beauty of our very Earth Not only the visual effects are extraordinary also the acting done by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are done perfectly Bullock portrays Dr Ryan Stone and Clooney portrays Astronaut Matt Kowalski both trying to get back to Earth when their space shuttle is destroyed by debris from a destroy satellite The tense that is created during the movie is indescribable You are being pulled into the story and set to get sweaty hands when the debris hits the space shuttle and comes back every 90 minutes Director writer and producer Alfonso Cuar n has created a spectacle which can be written in the history books as epic,10

6 April 2014,Gravity,Makes my top 10 worse movie list If you are into women empowerment Gravity is for you All the male cast is killed off within the first fifteen minutes of the movie Gravity is about Dr Stone a woman trying to prove herself on her first space flight mission She has no training to be an astronaut and the movie moves very slow There is no plot only her drifting in space trying to find a way to return to earth A big waste of money This is a womens lib movie and I thought women burned their bras in the 70s Why do movie makers think we still want to see this crap Do not get me wrong I am woman however I know when to roar do you,1
31 July 2019,Real Chill!,Movie about ocean and space almost always freaks me out I was scared by its dark blue color and how lonely it was out there Seeing Dr Stone spun out of control in the space gave me the real chill Sure I don t wanna go there I love Earth,8
1 July 2014,Loving Movie,As a piece of technology Gravity is really impressive I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don t stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn t made a fuss of and doesn t get in the way of enjoying the film Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn t stop until the end Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision but in this case the feeling of being in the film really work and aside from one or two thing coming at you moments it really worked For me equally impressive was the sound engineering most sound effects are given a really satisfying via contact sound the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects,9

2 May 2015,Zero Gravity,Although visually engaging and creatively directed Gravity fails to live up to the hype generated by critics possibly the same critics who slam the genuinely thought provoking and emotionally powerful films that I tend to enjoy It is a small scale disaster survival movie set in orbit yet the space travelling debris causing dilemmas for the main characters is not the disaster no the real catastrophe here is the star Sandra Bullock whose dialogue and questionable actions became so frustrating that not only did I wish her character would just drift off into infinite nothingness but I spent the entire night after viewing this film in a state of rage and utter confusion as to how something with so much potential can drift off into an inescapable and non redeeming black hole,3
24 November 2013,It's out of this world!,This film is truly and utterly amazing The film is completely set in space starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock It shows a group of astronauts on a space mission till a satellite is blown up near by Whilst trying to abort the mission things turn for the worst and one astronaut ends up alone and has to try and make their way back to earth When watching this film I was so tense that I couldn t move The cinema was completely silent during and after the film The story grips you from the beginning as we become connected to the characters we start to like them When things start to get to go wrong we instantly root for the astronaut to get back alive however we as an audience haven t all experienced being trapped in space so we have no answers Not many people consider the fact that it is silent in space which the film uses to its advantage sound sets the mood and sense of the loneliness which when watching this film I felt the same emotions We see the astronaut make progress and then almost like a rug pulled under the feet its taken away This is done throughout making me want to shout COME ON The effects are just incredible you believe that they are in space and with the techniques of the person person view I felt like I was there with them which is an achievement as I m usually sitting there thinking that would never happen This Sci Fi drama proves that you don t need aliens in a movie for it to be good Sorry not good amazing This film is one definitely to see in 3D everything comes flying out at you its the best 3D film I have ever seen and yet I have seen hundreds It would be really good in 2D as well just make sure your comfortable and don t leave your seat http joshwhitnallfilmreviews blogspot co uk,9

6 November 2013,Strap your seat belts for a full space experience with Dr Ryan Stone,Gravity comes as a Sci Fi space saga with some breath taking and stunning visuals purely through extraordinary VFX The story can broadly join the genre Survival flicks like Frozen 2010 Cast Away 2000 Wrecked 2010 Life of Pi 2012 etc But this incredible story takes you to experience space itself if you watch in 3D and feel the calmness emptiness point of nothing pitch black black hole silent black valley however you will describe that experience once out of the movie hall With a very limited but powerful casting the director Alfonso Cuar n has given us a visually magnificent and sumptuous tale of a lady survivor in space The cast includes Hollywood s well known talents Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as Dr Ryan stone and Matt Kowalski respectively George will be there for few minutes and has done the role of a veteran astronaut who is a kind of light hearted person even after facing a divorce Sandra the show stealer gives us a stunning performance in surviving hardships in space as well as a grieving mother who has lost her daughter recently Especially her expressions during panic moments and courageous face looks to overcome the tough time she has in space been so real The entire movie was so well crafted and was technically sound on the space concept side as well No doubts the entire credits go to the VFX team Verdict Enjoy this movie with your family only in theatres with 3D technology and strap your seat belts for outer space experience Definitely you will come out with lots of questions and discussions regarding space life and NASA This year s Oscar best female actress on a lead role Sandra bullock and best Male actor in a lead role Tom Hanks for sure Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran bsiva84 gmail com,8
16 October 2013,Just Visuals nothing else,I have given this movie 6 stars just because of visuals There are several such movies made In fact I thought I will sleep in between I would not recommend this to watch This movie has emotions but this does not look practical I had very high expectation compared to current rating but all waste I think IMDb should think about these ratings People are using IMDb for making people to watch their creation IMDb Admin please take this matter This is 3rd such instance in my knowledge One was Man of Steel other one was Oblivion Rating does not justify movie All the actors rols are not big enough except Sandra Bullock,6

14 February 2014,Great in technical aspects... decent as a film.,Gravity tosses you out of your house cinema or computer directly into orbit with incredible visual effects and even more amazing Sound Effects The movie generates a great atmosphere and background and deserves some recognition But it holds in it several physics ergo holds many plot failures that make it improbable and plain simple leaving alone the script In the acting department everyone makes a fine job showing you how scary space can be especially if you haven t experienced space that much It certainly is Sandra Bullock s best work Gravity is a good SFX showing although holds little movie potential and realism Works just fine as a boring Sunday film,7
26 December 2021,"Can't give more than 5, sorry.",It is a science fiction movie in space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I gave the movie a 5 I mean it was not a bad movie but also not super good movie Acting was good but I think the story and the movie was just not for me I just could not get into the movie,5
13 October 2013,Stunning images,It s hard to write of Gravity without introducing spoilers but I ll give it a summarized shot The images are stunning The local theater is only showing 3D that may be the only choice I m not a glasses fan but the 3D is done very well The sets are also very nicely done There are a lot of places where it is quite difficult to suspend disbelief on some of the technical points Gravity is not accurate in the physics sense from what I read and a few other places but to discuss them is to give away things Just accept Gravity as a suspenseful movie chock full of memorable images,7
5 November 2013,The new peak of filmmaking as a visual art-form.,As a long time follower of the human spaceflight programs I was looking forward to Gravity insanely much My expectations were sky high and I was not disappointed It is quite likely the most beautiful film I have ever seen This is not a futuristic film Unlike most space films it is based on real spacecraft and the chronology is just a little bit off with the mix of a Space Shuttle retired the Hubble Telescope current the International Space Station current and the Chinese space station Tiangong projected This is a portrayal of the work and risks that face actual astronauts right now Sure there are plenty of scientific inaccuracies to count but all of them are rather minor and are there too provide creative freedom for the story to be a real tour de force I m willing to accept all of them except the one crucial plot point that is based on an annoying inaccuracy but I will not spoil it for the reader nor did it spoil my full appreciation of the film After decades of seeing actors walk around in their spacecraft with the small scale exception of Apollo 13 here we have them floating around freely in a marvelous simulation of microgravity Finally Also sound is not transferred through empty space The only sounds heard in Gravity are the ones transmitted through matter or radio communication so you get the strange new experience of silent explosions The score does however break the illusion a bit but it s a damn good score Alfonso Cuar n shows that he is one of the few directors who knows how to use 3D technology to its full potential I have repeatedly been disappointed to see that most Hollywood directors stick to their traditional formula of fast paced cuts not seeming to care how annoying this is to the viewers who constantly have to re focus their eyes and lose the sensation of floating along with the action Cuar n however knows that long takes is the stuff that dreams are made of He got plenty of practice in his 2D masterpiece Children of Men on which Emmanuel Lubezki also was the cinematographer and even though Gravity is more reliant on CGI we are still treated to a number of astonishing long takes that sends us on a crazy roller coaster ride that might just get you space sick This is how 3D should be used The story has its flaws but even they are minor The plot is almost non stop excitement and it manages to toy with my emotions on several occasions The prospect of dying alone in the dark void sure comes through in all its scariness George Clooney is steady as a rock and gives a great performance but the big star is Sandra Bullock As a rookie astronaut who struggles with all her strength she uses her entire array of abilities and is just amazing The backdrop of the Earth below is portrayed in its full breath taking beauty as is the starry sky above and the detailed spacecraft in between The motion of objects in microgravity and near vacuum give us the rules of the game and even people who aren t too well read on rocket science should be able to follow This film is a visual delight and a pure show of state of the art film making It takes the audience on a wild ride just over the life giving Earth which looks so close but is so far away for the poor space travelers who desperately struggle to survive I highly recommend seeing Gravity at the cinema in 3D It just won t be the same on your home screen I ve seen it twice so far and I just want to come back for more I want Gravity to win a bunch of Oscars Definitely for cinematography and visual effects Hopefully also for acting directing and best picture This is a movie experience unlike any other,10
1 January 2014,Gravity,By far the best use of a fully immersive 3D environment since Avatar this is certainly a film to experience on the biggest screen you can get to 3D is perfect for space the stark outlines of objects against the emptiness of space or a beautiful distant earth working amazingly well rather than being distracting or headache inducing That s not to say there aren t any frantic action scenes in fact oddly enough this is my chief criticism of the film Poor old Dr Stone played by Bullock is certainly put through the wringer in this bad day at work the ever increasing perils and sheer bad luck she experiences becomes predictable and a final credibility shattering sequence involving a fire extinguisher made it clear that as unique beautifully made as it is it still follows Hollywood action film logic I also couldn t help but think of the far more beautiful fire extinguisher as propellant sequence in Pixar s Wall E For a film set in the silence of space there is a lot of dialogue which gets tiresome but to be fair there are several touching quiet scenes too The use of special effects is simply astounding and any fan of movies should go for the immersive experience if not the credibility stretching plot,8
16 February 2014,the best movie in 2013,the best space movie ever done Sandra Bullock deserve best actress Oscar the story was great this movie transports you to space in every cinematic way possible the visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space Film schools will be studying this film in the future Sandra Bullock deserves another Oscar after this as well as best director for Alfonso Cuaron and Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki I can t recommend this film enough Ground breaking beautiful and technically perfect Film schools will be studying this film in the future i cant find more word to describe this movie enough,10
23 October 2013,"""Gravity is one of the best films of the year!""",The recently released space thriller film Gravity which I watched in the movie theaters about three weeks ago focuses on the innovative tale spin story about hope and survival in space In other words original intense and thrilling plot For astronaut films watching Gravity is like watching a hi tech version and exact opposite of The Right Stuff 1983 It s also the exact opposite of other survival films such as Alive Cast Away and 127 hours Watching the suspense thrills in Gravity will have your heart pounding which I felt when I first saw it The two surviving astronauts were brilliantly portrayed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Their performances are all the more brilliant because they have never been in this type of survival picture or have played these types of characters Angelina Jolie and Robert Downey were originally cast as the two main characters but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts After Jolie dropped out other actresses such as Rachel Weisz Naomi Watts Natalie Portman Marion Cotillard Abbie Cornish Carey Mulligan Sienna Miller Scarlett Johansson Blake Lively Rebecca Hall and Olivia Wilde were all subsequently tested or approached for the lead role but it was Bullock who landed the lead The film also costars Ed Harris as the voice of mission control The thrilling plot is about a medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone Bullock who is a mission specialist on her first space shuttle mission along with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky George Clooney commanding his final flight before retiring Disaster ensues during a spacewalk when asteroid pieces and the remains of a space satellite hit the shuttle where the two astronauts are working The two are separated and left adrift in space leaving you to witness their fight for survival Alfonso Cuaron who also directed the film wrote a great original screenplay for this film Before Gravity there had not been a disaster film involving astronauts that s part of what helps make the screenplay so great Although Gravity does not involve terrifying extraterrestrials killing humans as in Ridley Scott s Alien when it comes to survival and suspense thrills this film does not disappoint Every motion cinematic shots of this film was wonderfully taken by the amazing Emmanuel Lubezki who also worked on Cuaron s Children of Men The cinematography shots of outer space are one of the great things of this film It s not just this it s so far one of the best cinematographies of this decade along with Black Swan 127 Hours The Tree of Life etc The cinematography is truly unbelievable in this film Gravity is one of the best movies so far of this year The tremendous special effects space survival story cinematography and acting makes this film so enjoyable I also loved the 91 minutes of the green screen effects The talent director picked the perfect two A list movie stars If this film is nominated for an Oscar for Best Special Effects I would put my money on it I also think this film should be one of the nominees for Best Picture of the year I would choose this film because it includes that 20 drama most Oscar nominated films are dramatic There were two astronaut films which have been both nominated for Best Picture The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 Given its genre it would be a significant milestone if Gravity took home the Oscar for Best Picture Gravity is still out in theaters and it s worth buying a ticket to see the movie For people who haven t seen a good astronaut flick in a long time go see this one I also recommend this film for astronomers and NASA scientists You all should see it before it comes out on Blu ray I give the film a powerful four out of four stars This film is rated PG 13 Parents strongly cautioned Existential terror and the salty language Cast crew info Directed by Alfonso Cuar n written by Alfonso Cuar n and Jon s Cuar n director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki edited by Alfonso Cuar n and Mark Sanger music by Steven Price production design by Andy Nicholson costumes by Jany Temime visual effects by Tim Webber produced by Alfonso Cuar n and David Heyman Released by Warner Brothers Pictures Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Starting Sandra Bullock Ryan Stone George Clooney Matt Kowalski and Ed Harris Voice of mission control,10

30 November 2013,Thrilling. Beautiful. Emotionally Engaging. 10/10,The trailer of the movie sells it as a space thriller in 3D which sounds highly generic Gravity is anything but The story is very simple but through its imagery and subtle dialogue the film tells you so much more Its a universal movie that reminds you life can be tough and there are things that haunt you But sometimes you just have to let go Let go and enjoy the ride that is life Any person going and has been through tough times can relate Visually words aren t enough to describe how breathtaking it is This is the best use of CGI I ve seen in a long time It s only made better by the amazing cinematography and Alfonso Cauron s signature super long takes with the camera free floating in space Only two actors in this movie and both nail it That s all I will say In fact its better if you watch Gravity knowing as little about it Do yourself a favor and see this movie no matter what type of person you are I recommend 3D Imax It s definitely worth the money,10
21 December 2013,Stunningly Brilliant!!,Dont let go they said Dont let go off the rope we thought Dont let go of hope they meant Gravity is a serious movie that leaves one speechless and spellbound wanting more 91 minutes with Sandra Bullock trapped in space is enough to make the audience jelly legged when the movie ends No violence no bloodshed or guns or cars no weird looking creatures of outer space no romance but just one woman who struggles against the odds for survival And still this movie was far more impressive than all the others that have violence and cars and so on Bottomline Definitely worth a watch on the big screen preferably in 3D if you are in a mood to be gasping like you have run a marathon,10
4 May 2014,Garbage,Thank god I didn t waste my money at the theater and picked it up at red box for 1 50 That s 90 minutes of my life I wont get back What a piece of garbage boring boring boring and did I say boring they made Sandra Bullock look like a lesbian and HOW in the world did they manage to spend 100 Million on making it Where did all that money go Total piece a junk This movie is just like Open Water except instead of waiting for them to be eaten by sharks you are waiting for them to get killed by floating space garbage We just couldn t wait for the movie to be over I thought that with Clooney and Bullock the movie would have been better but it was such a disappointment If I could give it zero stars I would have,1

10 December 2014,So bad it makes the Muppet's look like a science class,How this flick got to get Oscar nominations is beyond my understanding well except the visuals OK the visuals are very nice but the story is incredibly inexistent the characters are terribly non existent and very annoying I might add its an affront to logic science and simple everyday knowledge I get it its a sci fi or it wants to be one but you simply can not take every concept we take for granted and trough it out the window Its more of a story of mentally handicapped people gathered and sent into space to cause problems and act stupid And oh the evil Russians blowing things up and killing Gravity s clown astronauts And of course one of them miraculously escapes by freaking randomly pushing buttons in Russian and Chinese And that constant moaning and of course it was a woman who was scared s s and a male who was brave and tried to save her really We back in the 20 s I half expected to see slaves on the Russian and Chinese space stations D NASA should protest if people believe every idiot can go into space they might get a looooong waiting line at their door D And the ghost coming to provide wisdom at the hour of need too much D Actually its a good comedy if you don believe the hype D,2

11 October 2013,"A journey through outer space and surviving it, worth taking",Gravity is one hell of a space ride that should not be missed superb direction and 3D effects and a message to each and all even in the most difficult and terrifying times one thing you need to do is Hang On coz you definitely gonna make your way back home An extraordinary journey to the outer space worth taking filled with excitement and DANGER The only sad part which ironically is not inside the movie but outside of it its trailer doesn t do justice to it at all And to be watched in IMAX 3D is the best way to watch it If you plan to watch it otherwise won t find much difference between the movie and its trailer,10

6 February 2014,Oscar goes to Gravity-most overrated film of 2013.,It is amazing how many people liked this film Most of the major critics liked this film Well i barely was able to sit through this not very long movie Film was overly dramatic overly sentimental Clich s all over the place Writing was not very good Not very nuanced not subtle Story felt contrived not genuine And visuals in this case sometimes they do did not save this shallow storytelling Beside that i did not even like the visuals They did not look natural Way too digital The visuals reminded me video game visuals Looks pretty but have no dramatic depth to it And of course there is a happy ending Problem drama problem solved It s another feel good at the end film that pretends to be something it is not profound drama that asks deep and profound questions Character played by Sandra Bullock is ridicules Astronauts that go to space are highly trained professionals with high ability to work under pressure Character played by Sandra Bullock on another hand acts like a school girl who was scared by a slasher horror movie on TV Well any way Oscar goes to Gravity most overrated film of 2013 Stay away from it Rather go and rent Space Odyssey by Kubrick,2
12 November 2013,A sublime Sandra Bullock is lost in space.,A force such as gravity pulls the object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line Thus a small object in space will orbit a large one This 91 minute Warner Brothers film rated 12A in the UK tells the story of a small object like a space station or to be more precise a very small speck of an astronaut played by Sandra Bullock in orbit around the relatively very large Earth Space is big and in this vast Universe there are planets and stars with a lot of space in between This space is a void a vast nothing Film opens in space above Earth At first we hear nothing and see nothing Then a faint communication is heard which gradually gets louder We see a small speck get gradually larger It is a spacecraft and astronauts are working on it as it orbits high up above the Earth Sandra Bullock plays one astronaut George Clooney plays another Mr Clooney s astronaut is an experienced veteran Miss Bullock s astronaut by contrast is a rookie Both are engaged in a spacewalk Mr Clooney is enjoying his time in space however mission control are worried about Miss Bullock performing her allotted task without getting sick Those viewers who experienced the shaky camera of the recent Captain Phillips will be glad to know that this film is completely different from that You and I and Sandra Bullock may have no idea of what is up and down but only mission control will worry about sickness in this film Viewers while experiencing a realistic representation of weightlessness in space in this film will not find it filmed in such a way as to make them queasy In the vastness of space around Earth mission control detects a collision between two other space craft This sets off some sort of localized intergalactic bar billiards game Broken bits of spacecraft are now heading towards our astronauts who are now in deadly danger Film shows realistically the danger presented by these fast travelling objects All are in orbit and in the void of space there is no gravity or atmosphere between the objects and anything they may hit Collisions in space in Star Trek or similar films have been done before but this film shows the danger in a realistic way that other films have failed to capture before When the collisions occur they are catastrophic Astronaut Bullock loses her tether and floats off spinning out of control into space alone and with a finite amount of oxygen It has been said that Miss Bullock spent a lot of time preparing for this role She certainly conveys to us viewers the problems of weightlessness in space As well as objects hurtling through the void of space we also get a good representation of the problems of inertia Propulsion gets you moving in relation to other objects but how do you stop There are lots of bone crunching collisions attempts to catch and get a hold of objects are all well portrayed All of this while hurtling through the void of space orbiting above Earth George Clooney is perfect in the supporting role but Sandra Bullock is the real star of this film The film is clearly a Bullock vehicle but this space vehicle had to be very good It is Actress Bullock has been given a tremendous space vehicle Astronaut Bullock could only wish she had such a space vehicle Great as this film is Sandra Bullock has to carry it for it to succeed and carries it she does with a truly sublime performance Miss Bullock has graced the silver screen for many years now with great performances in rom coms Her everyday girlish charms have contributed to some of the greatest examples of the rom com genre There has never been any doubt that she can do light but what about the meatier more serious stuff Earlier this year Miss Bullock appeared in the surprisingly gritty The Heat female buddy cop action comedy Here though she goes much further this is her film a true action film that is exciting scary and tense It is a tour de force Film has some shocks surprises and twists It is also tense and emotional You may find it useful to carry a hanky This 91 minute film reminds us of the earlier Warner Brother films of yester year From start to finish there is not a single wasted scene The harshest of critics of 3D films has said that this film should be viewed in the 3D format This reviewer followed that advice and was richly rewarded for paying the extra Some cinemas give out and collect back in the 3D glasses Mine did not Instead of paying my usual UK 7 50p I paid 9 60p plus another 80p for the glasses I saw a great film and get to keep my Sandra Bullock 3D glasses for ever Before the film I endured some poor 3D film previews They did not look good but rather unreal No problem with this film though The 3D effect really helped in immersing into the film However it was all the little details that made this film Watch as the smallest of things float about into your vision and grow bigger and bigger as they approach you Again it is the details of these smallest of things that complete the effect of putting you in space with Miss Bullock Weightlessness makes everything float about and boy does it Knowing that we are not in space we are so immersed in this film that we feel that we are Even get into the head of Miss Bullock as the camera gives a POV from inside her helmet Be it breathless or breath taking Sandra Bullock delivers a truly truly sublime performance This is film making at it s very very best This really is a must see 3D and must see film 10 10,
6 October 2013,Great for mommy and daughter evening out!,It is a visually extraordinary movie Bullock s performance is out of this world literally I went to see it with my 12 year old daughter it was just wonderful to see a movie where the hero is a woman who is also a scientist I found this particularly inspiring in a male centered industry where usually the hero is busy answering the damsel in distress calls The plots develops fast keeping the tension up all of the time yet suitable also for young i e 12 years old audiences The scientific facts are accurate enough and actually impressive for a movie of this type Highly recommended for girls with a passion for science my daughter just loved it and certainly will recommend it to all of her classmate and girlfriends,8

5 January 2021,Everything goes wrong in an excellent survival movie,Astronauts struggle for survival after an extreme situation causes damage to their space shuttle I thoroughly enjoyed Gravity for the visual storytelling the real as opposed to sci fi space setting and the ongoing battle against adversity The plot for me was compelling as we see a group of astronauts placed in a horrifying situation then witness a fight to survive As the movie progresses the level of adversity increases and it becomes as much about the will to survive as much as the skill One character arc involves someone who is also experiencing tragedy in their personal life and the effort to survive both situations parallel each other This story is told with a mixture of brilliant visuals that work on many levels There are shots that establish scenes and tone perfectly epic tracking shots long takes and fast cuts in different places depending on what s happening Zero gravity effects are used wonderfully in a number of instances such as a tear drop floating out of someone s eye and a beautiful sequence of someone in the foetal position in an airlock The frightening disorientation of being untethered in space is incredibly powerful Gravity is made as realistically as possible but it takes a number of liberties with scientific fact to make things as cinematic as possible This is fine with me because I don t watch it for an exact science lesson I watch it for entertainment If I want a real science lesson I ll read a book on astrophysics or watch a NASA documentary If the excitement of the movie prompts children or adults to research the facts then it is a good educational starting point in my opinion If I was being hypercritical I would say that some of the script is heavy on exposition dialogue that feels like it s treating the audience like fools but I guess that might be down to a producer wanting to make sure everything can be easily understood so the movie makes a healthy profit Also the characters feel very Hollywood as opposed to how actual astronauts would likely behave The end is excellent and incredibly inspiring I haven t cheered a character on in movie for a long time but I couldn t help doing it in this scene Something that raises it above a solid 8 10 rating for me was watching my 5 year old daughter see it for the first time She was utterly gripped watching Sandra Bullock overcoming some of the obstacles she faced in this movie She sat there fists clenched almost ripping the airlock open along with the character during one scene When a movie is able to convey a story like that to such a young person and requires limited explanation from an adult you know it is good,9
6 April 2020,Amazing,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,7
2 September 2022,Wow. Gripping lost in space film!,There s not much backstory as Gravity dives pretty much straight into the action but wow is it breath taking The combination of the set design visual effects cinematography and directing make you forget that you re not actual in space The realism in this movie is on another level The attention to visual and audio detail is top notch where not a single moment in the movie takes you out of it We are fully entrenched in the story from the beginning and hoping for a positive outcome for our own sake throughout There are other space movies with more layers complex plots or character development but Gravity doesn t shy away from what it wants to be a lost in space fight to survive movie that takes its viewers on an unbelievable journey And boy does it succeed in doing so Verdict Watch it,8
4 October 2013,A sci-fi visual spectacle that shouldn't be missed,Gravity is truly a visually stunning sci fi thriller about two people a medical engineer and an astronaut trying to survive after an unexpected accident leaves them adrift in space The story is simple straightforward and predictable the entire film happens in space and there s only 2 actors you ll be seeing throughout the film However the visual aspects of the film are aesthetically breathtaking and realistic at the same time The visuals showing Earth or even aurora borealis is truly mesmerizing It successfully captures the terrifying dangers a person might experience while in space to the audience In space it s downright scary when all communication systems down no oxygen no gravity with extreme cold temperatures no sound where no one can hear you scream no one can help you and you re all alone Moreover Clooney managed to provide enough charm and Bullock s character has a likable personality for the audience to continue watching the film and hope that they manage to survive their ordeal The film also provides us some of the character s visual perspectives out of body floating and spinning experience explosions due to objects flying and colliding with each other in space without sound I believe this is as close as you can get to have a decent space experience in the cinema As Bullock s character said in the film it s truly one hell of a ride Recommended to watch it in 3D although 2D is still acceptable if you re in a tight budget http yjcool blogspot com 2013 10 movie review gravity html Rating 8 5 10,8

11 January 2014,Space Thriller for 10 year olds,I know this will sound elitist but who are these people and critics who thought Gravity was some sort of spectacular science fiction space thriller a la 2001 A Space Odyssey The only connection to such truly great movies is the blatant rip off by the director of the iconographic space fetal position but with Sandra Bullock doing the floating Are you kidding me how could any self respecting film critic or above average IQ viewer not recoil against such adolescent mimicry Unfortunately Gravity is not a movie for anyone with an above average IQ Yes the special effects are impressive but these days that just means spending enough money to hire the best computer graphics artists The story and direction is embarrassingly juvenile requiring a suspension of belief that goes way beyond that for average movies From the idiotic positioning of the brilliant engineer Sandra Bullock using eeny meeny miney mo to choose the critical sequence of re entry control buttons to the preposterous actual re entry and landing not in an ocean which cover 70 of the earth but over land and in a lake which cover 1 of earth Finally after plunging to Earth in a flaming capsule Bullock emerges unscathed and of course scantily clad and barefoot like a Xenon princess warrior from the primordial mud of this idyllic lake onto its uninhabited beach This movie was as nauseating and cringe worthy as any that I ve ever seen but my daughter took us so I had to sit quietly without speaking out or throwing up until I was home alone,3
21 April 2014,A film that actually makes up for the lack of story and dialogue with something else,This is a film that I can understand how some movie watchers might enjoy it and some others won t This isn t a movie that has a lot of meat and dialogue when it comes to the story Instead it s a tense film that takes place in space With realistic physics graphics special effects and sound Sure this are elements that critics bash on in films but it does bring something new in a artistic way Watching this film was like watching the movie Buried except I like this one better The entire film is about astronauts trying to survive by coming back to Earth from space when something goes horribly wrong The acting was also really good although short George Clooney just fit right into this role Some may say this film lacks substance and to a degree it does but that isn t the focus of this film Sure some films that focus only on special effects alone falters however this has something new and different to offer When you have your eyes glued to the screen and actually kinda care what happens and actually has your attention as an audience all the way through It s doing something right 7 9 10,7
22 October 2013,Poorly Written Script but Great Visuals,Gravity is a 2013 3D science fiction thriller and space drama film directed by Alfonso Cuar n The film stars Sandra Bullock as in experienced medical mission specialist Dr Ryan Stone and George Clooney as veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski They are the two surviving astronauts from a damaged Space Shuttle mission The movie is their attempt to survive in space and safely return to Earth The script is the main flaw of the movie It is full of scientific inaccuracies The writers etc could have consulted NASA to make a far better film The story itself although interesting is lazy and simple in its execution The movie is short by today s standards and barely comes in at ninety minutes The film makes excellent use of realistic special effects and real time drama Some scenes might induce motion sickness in sensitive individuals so taking an over the counter drug used to prevent nausea and motion sickness is highly recommended,7
30 November 2013,Purely compelling.,It s not to often that a movie can artfully utilize silence and nothingness another polarizing example is Paranormal Activity 1 such applies to Gravity a gripping thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney the story is short and simple yet quite powerful I won t spoil the movie for my lack of knowledge of the plot raised my expectations but it was a wise decision making the movie under 100 minutes leaving no room for unnecessary filler or fat From a standpoint of my eyes the movie is a feast to look out using gorgeous scenery and eye popping visuals that gives the impression they shot this movie in space The handful of scientific accuracies doesn t hurt either The acting is well done and realistically portrayed Using real reactions in tense situations and some clever dialogue that slightly reveals the main characters you stoop to their level when they are in turmoil almost like your e suffering or prevailing with them You will be very pleased and very surprised at what you see after the leave the theater after watching this incredible film An obvious Oscar nominee winner in the future and perhaps a film that filmmakers will study for years to come,7
21 July 2014,An experience more than a film,Okay Gravity is amazing That makes it sound like a film that you have to watch but on reflection I m still not so sure I sat through the whole ninety minutes of it and I m still not sure whether I liked it or not I m glad I saw it but I m not sure I d ever want to watch it again It s about two astronauts stranded in space when their shuttle gets struck by debris First the good the two and only leads George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are both worthy of their A list reputation and turn in excellent performances You ll really feel for their plight and be rooting for them to get back to Earth In fact the only thing better than their acting is the special effects themselves Sometimes it feels like you re really there with them as explosions and weightless tools float all about the place However the only thing that lets this masterpiece down is the story or lack of it They get caught up in one explosion Escape Move on to the next explosion Escape Then rinse and repeat for an hour and a half Having only two characters in the film kind of means that you know both won t die otherwise the movie will have to end Gravity is truly an epic movie in all aspects apart from the story possibly It s definitely in the same league as 2001 A Space Odyssey in terms of scale drama and awe However what made it so good was also its drawback Having long drawn out shots and minimal cast never really felt like a story film if you know what I mean Sometimes I felt like I was at the Epcot Centre in Disney World watching an exhibition on what space was like Yes Gravity is breath taking and will certain be hailed as a modern day classic by many And I m definitely glad I saw it Will I watch it again No Once is enough thanks http thewrongtreemoviereviews blogspot co uk,7
12 November 2013,Sandra Bullock: A One-Woman Show,I ve been a fan of Sandra Bullock for years but this is the first film in which she has really shown off her considerable acting talent The film is 90 minutes long and I would estimate that Ms Bullock was alone for about 65 70 minutes of it which is no mean feat My attention was held the whole time by her believable character the wonderful effects the slightly loopy physics and the sheer inventiveness of the CGI And the 3D effects were simply marvellous At first I thought that the film might run out of steam simply because of the lack of other characters but the fight for survival was so palpable so engaging that I simply didn t even realise that the film was a one woman show until after I had walked out of the cinema If you see no other film this year this is the one to see And pay for 3D it s worth every penny,9
29 December 2022,NOPE! JUST SILLY AS EVER!,Awhile ago I viewed and reviewed the movie GRAVITY At that time I gave the movie a score of 2 10 Today I happened across the movie as part of a return from a search for another movie I said to myself Self there was a lot of work put into making that movie The cinematography alone was fair to good and in places the effects were bordering on outstanding See what a kid with a descent computer and the latest cell phone can do in his bedroom Maybe I should give this movie another look I did Maybe I shouldn t have The re review resulted in a score of 1 10 The movie is downright silly and wrong on so many levels First you have to buy into the fact NASA would allow such a poorly trained dim witted crap for brains astronaut scientist to ride one of their vehicles Not likely Then you have to believe that left on her own she can read and understand English Russian and Chinese More than that she knows how to fly and operate spacecraft from those countries And she believes that critical commands like ABORT are beneath her You can see why she was voted The One Astronaut You d Love to Punch in the Nose in the Dead of Space Then Leave Her They REALLY missed the mark with this character They needed to dump this actor for one more believable in all aspects No I was right the first time I reviewed this movie The only good I can find in this movie is that it provided employment for a lot of folks Period,1

27 March 2014,"It was OK, but . . .",it doesn t deserve its current Mar 2014 score of 8 1 that is more than just a tad over generous Yes the visual effects were pretty cool but aside from that it was pretty predictable and very slow to the point More than once caught myself thinking Oh c mon shut up and get on with it or just die already Rather than being what I expected a suspenseful action sci fi flick its basically one of those personal angst sagas films where the main character s continually self analyze themselves to death It was almost as bad as a angst filled over dramatized Meloni Hartigay episode of Law Order SVU you know the ones I mean where you can cut the petty angst filled tension with a butter knife Needless to say these watch someone agonize over their pathetic life movies are not for me I expected to see action and action then more action not an insecure depressed 30 something doubting herself and her life s value for 90 minutes Truth be told every time it got slow and Stone Bullock started talking to or pitying herself again I grabbed the remote and hit Fast Forward until it got to something cool Yes it was worth the 1 27 rental fee at the RedBox and the hour it took to watch it thank God for Fast Fwd but man am I ever glad I didn t waste an evening and drop 20 Snack Bar cash at the theater to see it Dollar for dollar the overnight DVD rental two 6 packs of beer and a pizza would be a much sounder investment Seriously I think you ll agree 5 stars is more than fair for Gravity,5

13 January 2014,Want realism? Watch Discovery channel,OK let me start by saying this is the best Cinema experience I have ever experienced in 3D anyway it was a feast for the eyes and ears and the tension was there throughout People whine and moan about the story this wouldn t happen that was far fetched etc if you want to go see a film where 2 astronauts do a space walk fix the Hubble and land there s plenty of those on the discovery channel I myself go to the cinema to escape real life not add to it Don t be put off by geeks ripping this film apart with science I love physics but I also love the fantasy world of cinema I m glad I saw it at on the big screen it was a blast see what I did there,9

14 November 2013,It's like nothing I've ever watched,I walked into this picture not knowing what to expect On the one hand I d seen the trailer which truly whet my appetite On the other I d heard various critiques from people saying the film was boring unrealistic Well let s just say it leaned towards the first hand for me From the opening scene you realise how beautiful this film is going to be as the camera pans round Earth in the background I hate the use of 3D in films the glasses annoy me it s more expensive and most of the time its completely unnecessary Not in this film The 3D is used in a way which literally means you feel like part of the film In the main I d say the majority of the attraction to this film would be for the way it s shot and the excellent use of 3D That s not to discount the story though I ve heard read a lot of people doubting the believability of what happens well don t listen to them Don t get me wrong most of the time I m a stickler for believability but not here I don t profess to know anything about the physics of space the general layout of space or if what Ryan does up there is truly possible Neither do I have any idea about the inside of a spacecraft or whether there are similarities between say the Russian and Chinese which doesn t yet exist escape pods So why question it Miracles happen on Earth every now and again comparable to her feat In any case I d rather watch what was set out before me than for instance Ryan and the rest of the crew being killed in the initial debris hit Boom ten minutes film over On to the story From the very opening scene the tension starts to build and doesn t cease until the final minutes of the film I don t want to give anything away so I won t go into it but every time you begin to feel comfortable this film throws another curve ball at you It s also emotionally powerful in one scene Ryan breaks down and begins to hallucinate Then using her vision as motivation to continue and fight on You ve got the whole package here action drama and something for everybody in general In fact there is only one criticism I d direct at the film and that is the comparatively thin storyline why the hell is she actually up there If I put the experience into one sentence that sentence would be It s like nothing I ve ever watched In my eyes a very apt title for this review All in all it s a unique cinematic experience I d recommend to anybody,9
10 January 2023,Space world,I loved it Honestly for me the film has very different angles to view The main plot and idea sent forward was be careful what you wish for or more nicely You get what you want E g Matt Kowalsky is charismatic beauty loving character and this film shows that its his last flight He also wants to beat Russian astronaut s space time by staying in outer space as much as possible but unfortunatelly or fortunately he had to return after this last mission leaving him no chance to beat this record until life has different plans on these astronauts At the end he is left floating space in an amazing view and beating Russian astronaut Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock has very complex ending She tells that she loves silence and loneliness First time when space junk hits the shuttle I thought the real ending was that she got what she wanted but eventually she gets rescued or her oxygen runs out she just is left to have all the rest in her imagination She suffers from depression and most depressed people think they are better stay alone than hurt by someone else but in reality those people are the ones who needs help who needs communication who is despair She eventually find her strenghs to fight back and overcome depression It doesn t matter at this point if she got back to Earth or left floating the Space she now has understood what she always wanted and left with it She has the best friend Matt Kowalski George Clooney Conclusion is that we all are humans we always need interaction between each other Watch for your loved ones keep them safe,10
26 November 2013,Gravity falling,Lets start with the good points Gravity is the greatest piece of visual cinema ever I is made to be watched in 3D in the cinema This is what 3D should be like every time It really felt like I was in space Sandra Bulloch was fantastic in this considering that she probably was on her own for most of the movie she does a great job George Clooney was Geaorge Clooney his lines was funny but not realistic and his scene at the start was a bit farcical but I suppose it set the scene The plot was more Star wars than National Geographic That Sandra was able to go from station to station s dare I say relatively easy was silly but I suppose its hard to create a decent story in orbit so I Ll forgive them This is great cinema it reminds me of 2001 even with the flaws its the greatest cinema experience ever,10
4 October 2014,mind hallucinating..,Experienced GRAVITY Note my opinion may be very less for the actual description of the movie this kind of movie may or may not be experienced in decade the visual effects are not even a little away from reality you feel like being part of the story nd get involved in it so deep that in the end you feel like achieving victory nd rebirth no doubt alfonso cuaron directed the best of HP series prisoner of Azkaban but your heart will b wondering nd mind hallucinating after seeing this direction P S watch this because their can t b any movie like this May b different but never like this you will regret for not watching I love earth nd mankind,9
11 March 2019,Wish I could give it a NEGATIVE -10 rating!,The DUMBEST movie I ve ever had the NON PLEASURE of watching I want a refund on the amount of my life it took away Completely unrealistic Yes I know it s fiction but even fiction usually has SOME kind of realism This movie is a pure joke The only good part is knowing George Clooney dies horribly,1
26 October 2013,An artistic triumph,It is my prediction that this film will go down not as one of the best films of this year but of any year This film sets out and achieves the remarkable task of riding along with Dr Ryan and looking out through her eyes as she works through external and internal challenges Direct spare intelligent and triumphant Movies have in my humble opinion been relegated to the exploitive and or nakedly commercial Stallone and De Niro star in predictable vehicles that look like excuses to pay off their vacation homes Gravity on the other hand is a tight tense work of beauty and power Tension and release the elements of music and humor and all great art I cannot recall a film that created such a powerful experience for the viewer There should have been seat belts in the theater,10
29 December 2014,"""Gravity"" Falls Flat",If you find excitement about seeing Sandra Bullock rolling around in space panting for two hours this is the movie for you The main point of this movie was simply to show off how good CGI is nowadays The CGI was in fact amazing to look at which is why I gave it a 4 But it is a truly lacking movie besides that There s not really much plot and the characters are the generic carbon copy helpless female and George Clooney yes George Clooney is his own category That scene where she barks like a dog on the phone though touching to most I found very embarrassing I got what was happening in the scene but just no I watched this back when it came out and that one time had left a strong impression on me This is one of the most overrated films on IMDb The Exorcist has an 8 just like Gravity Now let me clarify this In The Exorcist those two hours are filled with such classic scenes including but not limited to a girl peeing on the carpet spider walking down stairs puking in a priest s face why you do this to me Demi and a priest getting hurled out a window and down the alley stairs All Gravity has to offer in its two hours is like I said before Bullock rolling around and crying in space and hallucinations of George Clooney What a waste of celluloid,4
1 December 2013,A pleasant surprise!,On the face of it Gravity doesn t sound like a bunch of fun The film is pretty much entirely based on a monologue from Sandra Bullock with occasional support from George Clooney Bullock plays Ryan Stone who is a medical engineer on a space flight Things go wrong and she is supported by Matt Kowalsky a veteran astronaut Amazingly the movie is a lot better than you imagine beforehand The acting of Bullock and Clooney is fine and the visuals are amazing It s very hard to believe that the movie wasn t actually shot in space or a gravity free environment It s also in 3d and a rare example where the format really works well Very enjoyable,6

20 October 2013,Cuarón has created a masterpiece !,Before coming to Albanian cinemas I heard and read that this was one of the best Sci Fi movies ever made I was the first person to book it s ticket to my city s cinema and I ve made a marvelous decision Gravity has a simple story one of the simplest but it catches your heart and opens your imagination like none before The visuals in 3D were amazing and the acting was very good I really liked Sandra Bullock and I m sure she will be nominated for an Oscar Gravity was like a short totally filled with knowledge space encyclopedia I recommend this movie not only to sci fi genre fans and lovers I recommend it to everyone as this is one of the most special 90 minutes of your movie experience,8
18 November 2013,I had high expectations for this film. It exceeded them.,It is a very rare occurrence when I come out of a film when it exceeds my expectations Notable cases are Batman Begins and Prometheus This film takes it to a new level From the opening lines on the screen and the increases in volume in the music you know this film will grab you Throughout the while film the hair on the back of my neck stood on end the graphics stunned me and I felt the tension when you can see from afar the shrapnel appearing seeing it hit and hear NOTHING Sure the science in the film isn t flawless but my lord was it close In my opinion this film is as close to perfection as I have seen And I have seen coming close to 1000 films Is this the best film I have ever seen Yes I cannot recommend the film highly enough,10
8 March 2014,"Worst space movie ever (even ""Dark Star"" was better)",This movie is boring at best Sure it has some nice CGI effects in it but the story is pretty much non existent in this flick I can t wrap my head around the fact that so many people accept this junk as a triple A title The CGI scenery the light the camera etc are all nice and well done but this is definitely not a good space movie It lacks depth the characters never develop good enough for the viewer to sympathize with them in the contrary they seem to actively keep trying to annoy the viewer This goes especially for Sandra Bullock who without a doubt is one of the worst actresses in AAA movies today in my humble opinion Some additional acting classes wouldn t hurt All she seems to do in movies is heavy breathing you might as well watch pornographic videos with the audio of this movie And even then you won t be able to enjoy it because she can t deliver any credibility it just seems fake and unprofessional What that woman is doing in space is beyond credible That does not mean that George Clooney does deliver though His character lacks just as much development in the movie all he does is talk calmly to counter the stress that Sandra is generating I love you Sandra as a person but you should have turned down this one It does not help your career to be in such a mindless movie no matter how well funded it is But and this is a huge but in the actors defense it all comes down to the writers Writers seem to lack the ability to come up with something better than this nowadays Which is very sad because it means they have been losing their creativity If you want to see a better movie about space you re better off watching Mission to Mars which is not great either but definitely much better The director definitely did not have a vision with this one either He seems to focus more on CGI rather than character development What can I say with that equipment and funding they all could ve done a better job What a waste of time money and effort Sorry but this one is a big fat fail,2

29 July 2022,Visually stunning,I personally find the visual performances in this film compensate for what might be lacking in the script I still feel like everything works in this film Saw it originally in the theater and it was pretty amazing to see and hear it in that environment I still enjoy it almost a decade later,9
31 March 2014,A different film!,GRAVITY is a different film At least it s not similar to any other movie I ve ever seen and it clearly has some particular issues which turn it into a different and unusual film Some of them are good I would say even excellent some of them are not so good The good things GRAVITY setting is beautiful The views of the Earth from outer space the sunrise scene the cosmonauts floating on space all of this is done with beautiful images and scenes and with incredible CGI The special effects are just amazing superb I would say And I also did watch it in 3D and it was wonderful A magnificent 3D experience the best one I ve had so far I didn t watch too many films in 3D though The acting by Sandra Bullock is great she does an excellent job but she s alone The soundtrack it s also very good and every single track fits very well in the film Now the bad issues The plot It s so tiny so little that it almost doesn t exist There s one plot in this film of course but it s so simple and short that I think that a movie with all this visual greatness and excellent CGI would deserve a better and more elaborated plot even if it was around the same thematic It could have been done with more characters more subplots etc I think it fell a bit too short that way One example that this movie is too centred in the character performed by Sandra Bullock is when she arrives either on the ISS and the Chinese stations and there were nobody there dead or alive Why weren t there any cosmonauts Did they were taking a walk on space I don t think so So together with some usual and typical Hollywood clich s this lack of plot and the absence of other characters are the most let downs in this movie to me But as I said in the beginning all the rest is pretty good,7
15 March 2014,Pointless story and sometimes just silly,If you only want good effects specially on 3D you will like it If you care about story and realism forget it Since was a space movie I was expecting some professionalism Not necessarily like Apollo 13 but at least a little Oh boy I was wrong From beginning you can tell this is going to be bad I mean is like I am not watching real astronauts For example in the beginning you see one of the main characters flying around wasting fuel just doing pointless spins around the ship Really Just go around over and over while talking like they are in high school When they suppose to be doing a serious mission Was too obvious from beginning that was going to be another effect parade and story just was an excuse to show it They try to put the emotional parts but for me they fail Sad parts don t make it a good story Maybe what I hate the most was George Clooney character I don t know if is Clooney fault or writer fault but that character was just too cocky Too not real astronaut like I don t know how to explain Is a space clown but with hero write all over it to try to make you like him Surrealism is very common on Hollywood Sometimes we forgive some of that for the entertainment or for a good story But this time don t work at all Good effects is not enough to make a good movie Worst movie No Visual effects was nice and at least that part I did enjoy Gets old after a while though That is where the good story should get in It never comes on Gravity After a while I counted the minutes to the end Summary pointless boring good visual effects music was good enough,2

17 October 2013,Gravity is a good film and I guess I wouldn't call it overrated but you might say it's something of an unfinished movie.,In this day and age when it comes to films about space there are some very different kind of films On one end there are truly low budget horror films like Jason X Critters 4 and Leprechaun 4 In Space There are also some decent small indie films about space like the popular 2009 Moon and Europa Report from 2013 That said Gravity breaks all traditions regarding space films Gravity has a well known director in Alfonso Cuaron two big name actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the leads and is trying very hard to appeal to a mainstream audience When you put it all together Gravity is one solid space movie but not perfect With the exception of the very last scene space is the setting as we follow medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney During a standard spacewalk to the Hubble Space Telescope the crew learn from Mission Control in Houston that debris is drifting towards them from a dead satellite destroyed by the Russians As the debris damages the Shuttle and eventually disengages them from the ship Ryan and Matt find themselves stranded in space with no communication with earth and oxygen running low I do not know why big name actors were needed in this film Some of the small space films I mentioned earlier were just fine without a big name cast and in some ways very popular actors can be a distraction to an original film with the interesting subject like space None the less these leads are accountable and do some very fine acting with some well established characters Ryan is kind of a loner with a rough past and has lost a young child and is still very much recovering from that and trying to find herself Ryan s lost daughter is her main source of motivation and support for her The leads do have some chemistry and both are quite likable and this is good The plot is not complex and very simple and this lends itself to a short running time for this movie One main focus of this movie is to simply show space Through excellent design and cinematography it makes space look spectacular and strangely claustrophobic and it really stands out There are some highlights to the plot but it is still too thin At times I felt a little bored and it felt like there just was not enough to this movie If there was just a little more to it this film could have been something else As credits roll one question I had was What is the meaning of the film Frankly there doesn t seem to be one Without it you could question why should I care about this The film doesn t even touch this Why not It s a beautiful movie but so what Gravity is a good film and I guess I wouldn t call it overrated but you might say it s something of an unfinished movie That said this is a film that will be most important more on a second or third viewing,8
3 December 2019,"In space, no one cane hear you YAWN!",Wow I don t get how Gravity was nominated for Best Picture Seriously it has all the qualities that professional critics would moan about yet they praised it and most reviews saying It just pulls you in and it feels great to watch the effects are mind blowing Right even though the story is boring The scene where Clooney talks to Ryan makes zero sense People claiming Sandra Bullock portrayed a strong willed woman is crap as she spends most of the movie running or crying The effects weren t even that good,1
9 December 2013,I can't figure out the hype...,This movie was incredibly boring and pointless a lot made no sense and I can t remember the last time I was so happy for a movie to end My friends and I all agree and at many points of the movie thought about walking out rather than waste my time that could be better spent staring at a wall waiting for wet paint to dry but I kept on telling myself that it has to get good at some point the ratings are so high It never happened and all I want to say is don t watch this film the only reason I am giving it more than one is because of the impressive CGI A really boring movie The critics must have been paid off,2
16 January 2014,The More Things Change...,I don t know whether to be reassured or disturbed that after more than a century a space movie like this has no more scientific verisimilitude than the 1902 A Trip to the Moon La Voyage dans la Lune Whatever it is contempt for the audience the arrogant ignorance of film makers or the desire to cater to the 50 of people who are below average in intelligence I find movies harder and harder to stomach and in this case not because of the vertigo from motion sickness but from constantly rolling my eyes at the stupidity For those who enjoyed this movie I say Great But don t broadcast your enthusiasm too loudly if you don t want people to know which side of the bell shaped curve your intelligence lies,6

6 October 2013,"Gritty, visually spectacular and well acted",I am always a little leery about seeing movies in 3 D because I have issues with motion sickness But I sucked it up and saw in IMAX 3 D Let me tell you from the start this is the only way Gravity should be seen From the opening scene you will almost feel a sense of weightlessness in your theater seat It is so much greater with the depth you feel in 3 D The director does such a great job of switching between the awesomeness and openness of space and Earth to the claustrophobia that Bullock senses inside her own space suit I will admit there are scenes during the movie that could have been moved along a little more swiftly Believe me those short respites from action in the film are welcomed Most of the movie is a white knuckle edge of your seat thrill ride Like others have said Cloonie plays little more than a supporting role to Bullock However his character is well scripted and supports Bullock superbly I have never viewed Bullock in a more gripping and introspective role Not only does she have to deal with her physical surroundings but she has to face down her own mental and emotional demons as well For parents there are a few swear words throughout the film including a very quick F word Also Bullock is shown in a few scenes with little more than underwear and a t shirt on This is a great movie and maybe the best movie in this decade,8

2 March 2014,Lost in it's own hype,If a movie has ground breaking special effects then so what who cares If you want that then jump go jump on a roll a coaster and leave your mind in candy floss machine Gravity is just that candy floss and equally as vacuous and unnutritious Junk food in space with extra cheese in the form of in the womb metaphors as well as the usual Hollywood nonsense of our America saves the world again How how everything would be so much easier if everything was in English and those pesky Chinese and Russians did not write their own language on all those colourful buttons This movie is a stinker unrealistic and smells of nationalism Avoid and poke yourself in the eye instead,1
4 March 2014,Didn't deserve the Oscars???,I am reading some reviewers that say it didn t deserve the Oscars SEVEN of them have you ever said he didn t deserve the touchdown he just got it PERIOD the movie IS A JEWEL no more no less an extraordinary achievement in many levels the story is minimalistic not thin not simplistic the acting is top notch the visual effects are incredible the music and the sound are excellent I was on the edge of my seat the whole 90 minutes I have seen more than 2 000 movies in my life this movie is at my top three that is how good it is Alfonso Cuaron films include Little Princess Y Tu Mama Tambien Great Expectations Children of Men Solo Con Tu Pareja he has grown over this years to become one of the Greatest Directors of our time I strongly recommend you to see this film preferably in 3D at a theater sadly Im not sure if you are going to like it it depends on your movie preferences,10

5 January 2014,Visually arresting sci-fi suspense with great 3D visuals,When I saw Avatar in 3D I thought this 3D adds nothing to the movie at all Since then I ve avoided the more expensive 3D films but I wound up watching Gravity in 3D and I have to admit that I find it difficult to imagine how it would be without it Directed by Cuaron this is an artist really thinking through the technology rather than simply tossing out cool effects The opening space walk scene is amazing not because a bunch of things fly at the camera but because you just have this amazing sense of floating in 3D space The movie is stunningly filmed and its suspenseful story of survival is consistently engrossing and well paced It is so well written and filmed that it is probably quite good even in 2D but if any movie makes the case for 3D as a tool for serious film making it is this one,9
20 June 2019,Visually and sonically impressive portrait about survival...,Visually and sonically mindblowing portrait about survival in deep space Deservedly a multiple oscar winner for visuals and sound I have seen many many many scifi pictures in space and Gravity beats them ALL hands down with its stunning visuals and pulsating deep sounds Dramatically speaking there is a SMALL weak point though in the fact that this is basically a movie about 1 person who is totally ALONE She Sandra Bullock talks to herself constantly while she is trying to get back to earth after her space shuttle imploded It is quite difficult to make great drama when a person is totally by herself dressed up in a space suit It is not the ideal set of circumstances to create great drama but I have seen this movie many times now and the simultaneously presence of sheer desperation about the fear of dying AND the feverish UPLIFTING determination to make it back to earth alive is very impressive Sandra Bulllock is not the greatest drama actress around but she really gives one of her finest serious dramatic performances of her entire carreer When I have watched this movie I feel empowered and glorious when I havent even left my chair THAT is how powerful this portrait about survival is Chapeau Masterful I recommend it to all my friends and family and now also to you dear Imdb reader,8
14 October 2013,What a complete waste of CG,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,3
23 October 2013,A space film with human emotion!!,I don t want to give any spoilers so I am not going to mention scenes here I heard and read a lot about Gravity from my film fraternity friends and colleagues Everyone said Don t miss it I am a George Clooney fan but never was one of Sandra Bullock I entered the theater hoping to see George Clooney in space suit and having wise cracks at every other character By God I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock giving such a matured and nuance performance There were a few plot holes but the effort of the director and screenplay writer to keep audience engaged through out the 90 minutes with no major geographical changes is commendable In space or even in life you never know which can trigger a disaster In such case losing yourself is pretty easy compared to fighting for survival You can lose your hope in a minute and give up for all good but to sustain the hunger to live and prosper gets even difficult with every passing moment This film shows you the way to keep the belief going and survive this momentary loneliness The camera work and Vfx are breathtaking Recommend you to watch it with an open mind even if you do have expectations film can live up to them This film is a classic case of either you love it completely or hate it Hope you find and experience the former emotion Space is too big to hate,9
9 December 2013,Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris...,I must admit at first glance when I saw who was on the cast list I thought that this couldn t possibly be as good as people said Yeah I can t claim to be a fan of neither Bullock nor Clooney However with all the great reviews and publicity the movie was getting I decided to give it a go and I must admit that I am possibly surprised by it George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are so far away from their usual roles here that it actually works out quite well and especially Bullock was carrying the movie so amazingly well with her performance here The story was greatly paced and there was never really a dull moment throughout the movie And those quiet moments here and there throughout the course of the movie just helped to add to the believability of the movie and it was like the audience was right there in space with them I will say that a lot of credit for this movie really goes out to the camera crew Wow the cinematography and the angles here were just great it was very dynamic vibrant and so full of adrenaline The way that the movie was shot was so helpful to adding to the atmosphere and the believability of the movie Now don t expect to see any aliens or foreign lifeforms No this is solely a movie about having all odds against you and rising to the occasion and relying on your instincts and putting your training to use If you want to survive you will survive as where there is a will there is a way Gravity is great entertainment and is a captivating story and you get thrown into the action right away The movie has a good amount of suspense and thrills and you really root for Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock as she struggles through the obstacles Even with a cast list of that few people director Alfonso Cuar n did an amazing job with Gravity And also it should be pointed out that the musical score for Gravity was off the charts The music was so nicely performed and really brought so much to each scene Well worth a watch be it 3D or not,7
20 January 2019,Ridiculously overrated,This was a fun movie to watch with great visuals but 7 oscars Give me a break Interstellar was much more cerebral and a better film overall,7

30 September 2021,Emotional rollercoaster in space!,The intense focus on the face made the emotional experience very real,8
30 December 2013,No sense of reality,Sandra Bullock is Ryan Stone an acclaimed medical engineer currently working in space with George Clooney as veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky After a disaster strikes she finds herself alone adrift and spiraling out of control Films starring Sandra Bullock are usually best avoided but being directed by Alfonso Cuar n and all the praise we put on those ridiculous sunglasses so to not feel left out on some great new cinematic experience While Sandra Bullock is as unexciting to watch as ever George Clooney makes the perfect veteran astronaut As for the state of the art 3D special effects it doesn t help the story In fact it hurts the film Everything looks so smooth and perfect it feels like a cartoon It leaves those of us aware feeling safe and therefore we are unaffected despite what is going on within the story As always and now more than ever Cuar n masterfully captures entire scenes in long elaborate takes However at this excessive amount it never lets us into the story It s just endless clever shot compositions that only keep reminding us we are watching a film because the camera is too busy showing off The greatest aspect of the film is it s sound design Gravity is a great story that s beautiful computer generated images work against it There is no sense of reality which leaves no tension and no dread Just pretty pictures without the ability to suck us in,2

9 October 2013,"Incredible on a big screen, just good at home",I will start by saying that this movie does not deserve a 8 7 rating Really it does not Visually it deserves a 9 The movie is visually stunning and Alfonso Cuaron really knows where to put his camera You will be amazed watching this movie in a 3d cinema Incredible space views of the Earth and special effects probably make this movie the best space sci fi ever produced However the writing is quite predictable Yes we cannot put this movie in the same league of Fight Club Schindler s List or Forrest Gump as current IMDb s rating is suggesting This will be an easily forgettable movie starts well slow down to a point where you will start to be bored in the middle of the movie To conclude I think this movie deserves a 7 out of 10 9 visually and 6 for the writing,7
28 November 2013,Two people bob about in space,What Gravity does extremely well at is transporting the viewer into space The floaty camera work is absolutely brilliant and during the action it s sometimes just damn stunning Action films could learn a lot from Gravity as a lot of this film is done in singular long takes which is much more tense and involving to watch than frantic quick cut editing which makes it impossible to see what s going on I also enjoyed the POV shots which literally put the viewer in Sandra s shoes or space boots and create some fantastic disorientation The visuals are also consistently amazing It s hard to believe that basically everything is CGI because it all looks so very real Even Gravity s biggest critics have to at least appreciate the amount of work that has gone on in the visual department However I doubt that Gravity s stint in IMDb s top 250 will last Gravity is very much a cinema film It s a film that has to be experienced on a big screen and in 3D to get everything out of it At home on your 20 black and white portable TV video combo it won t look so impressive In fact a lot of people will find it quite boring to be quite frank The pacing in Gravity is very slow at times which I didn t mind but it could become a chore with multiple viewings My guess is that the novelty will quickly wear off when it hits our DVD shelves Part of the excitement of Gravity is not knowing what s going to come next I was wondering how they were going to make a feature length film from two people bobbing about in space but they managed it and for the first time it s great However when you strip down Gravity plot wise you ll find that there s not too much going on The film is all about survival and Sandra puts on an excellent performance as Ryan Stone The idea of being lost in space is a pretty terrifying one and it s perfectly executed here Unfortunately George isn t quite so good He seems more like a spare part and is only there to look good Although to be fair his character isn t too well written He just seems like some babbling idiot who s not fazed by anything which is difficult to believe Gravity is mostly a one woman show though and Sandra makes Ryan a compelling character There are some surprisingly emotional scenes as well which are just as impressive as the big set pieces Gravity has fallen into the hype machine a little bit I don t think it s the best film of the year It s more like a ride that ll quickly ware thin with multiple viewings Don t get me wrong I enjoyed it and I thought that the 3D was used really well but I wouldn t be in a hurry to see it again I also didn t find it as intense as others did I think Black Swan and last year s The Dark Knight Rises are far more intense pieces Gravity is very suspenseful though and masterfully shot It s well worth seeing but be sure to make your first time the best Seek out the biggest screen you can put on your 3D glasses and let the film sweep you away It might not be the best space film ever made but it s a very entertaining and sometimes incredibly stunning piece of work,8

22 October 2013,A Flawed Visual Extravaganza,Reviewed by Dare Devil Kid DDK Rating 2 5 5 stars All hoopla and no real steam Don t care who found it astounding or spellbinding or whatever superlatives are being used to describe this over indulgent soporific mess of a sci fi drama Now the film isn t bad by any stretch of the imagination It s just not as great as it s being made out to be and that s what peeves me In fact after ages I actually felt like walking out of the cinema hall midway and I usually don t do that for even worse movies than this The reason being that this movie is plain and simple boooooorrrrring as hell The biggest drawback of this film is that it becomes all to predictable and static after a certain point and that point arrives all too soon If it wasn t for Sandra Bullock and her amazing performance which somehow managed to salvage the disintegrating remains of Gravity I actually might have walked out on the movie Sandra Bullock is the life and soul of Gravity and along with the stunning visuals the only good thing in the entire movie George Clooney also manages to get your attention in his surprisingly brief appearance The visuals while exemplary are not worth your time and effort to sit through the lethargic proceedings So if you do wish to catch Gravity just because it s being pushed down our throats as something so cool and contemporary and the biggest spectacle since Avatar an infinitely superior film then watch it for Bullock s performance and her performance alone Sadly even her mesmerizing and captivating act cannot make us care in the end if her character actually manages to survive the ordeal or not only because of the painful ordeal the film itself inflicts upon us,6

19 May 2014,A great film about overcoming terrible odds,Wow there are a lot of bad reviews on this movie around here most of them disappointed for the lack of absolute realism My what strange expectations you kids seem to have I ve never seen a scientifically perfect sci fi film and if you can t let some of it slide in favor of a little Movie Physics then the problem is yours It s not a documentary it s a story What I knew of this movie was that it got great reviews by a lot of people after its release and it was set in space with excellent graphics Accurate on both counts It kicks off without any background stuff characterization and lead in minimal The entire thing start to finish is focused on the trials of Sandra Bullock which for once she s not so annoying mostly because she has to spend most of the film reacting to her environment which is quickly falling apart The entire thing is about overcoming in a harsh place which might have just hit the spot for me when I watched it The dialogue was not elegant but worked anyway the characters could have been essentially mute and I still would have enjoyed it There s no good guys versus bad guys no subplots really minimal garbage to clutter up what s going on The lapse into religion and odd symbolism are there all of it representative of scarred people struggling for safety the fetal position thing was I think somewhat misinterpreted as rebirth which would have been a strange metaphor given where this was in the plot None of this is terribly intrusive although it is certainly nothing special But it s easy enough to let it pass But then there are the graphics My TV is not an advanced piece of machinery but it didn t matter because the real treat of these graphics is how they pull you into the situation Cuaron knows how to use the perspective of the camera lens and you feel every body impact as Bullock gets thrown onto every man made piece of hardware in orbit Sandra hits all the right emotional notes without extensive exposition you can feel how she feels and you know that in her position you would probably be ready to quit like she often seems to be It s fine acting and if you aren t nitpicking the science or probabilities of what you see harrowing stuff Great film if you want to root for someone against the odds and everyone likes doing that Watch it and let that which does not matter slide,9
4 October 2013,Can't really see all the greatness !,Nice directing camera motion animation visual effects But The acting is not as good Sandra bullock can not do solos that s proved on this film Great actor no doubt in that but not a one girl show type George Clooney is being the usual great and funny man he wasn t acting though he was being himself that s all The bottom line here is that if you like to be amazed by high tech 3D stuff and nice camera motion you are in for a treat For me I found the plot rather ridiculous really it is a science fiction story that would creep the hell out of Isaac Asimov It s pure nonsense to consider Space as a 1200 square mile big where satellites are falling like domino For the characters they are so poorly drawn Clooney s character has absolutely no depth none Zip even Sandra s character has very little depth that s poorly performed and written So basically no acting and no story only fast paced action disaster movie with no solid plots that just happened in Outer space only good directing and effects This movie isn t remotely likely to make it to the classics wall But that doesn t mean I regret watching it after all,5
8 March 2014,"""Impress me, Spanish man""",An artistic experience I sat thru mesmerized from the opening text to the final shot There is a reason film festivals 2013 top ten lists and most nay sayers of modern effects went wild GRAVITY is a hypnotic magnificently realized vision of what our furthest reaches contain astounding beauty with a dark dangerous edge I d been following this specific project since it was announced in COMING SOON in mid 2012 I remember thinking So Clooney and Sandra Bullock float through space for 90 mins Need to see The most surprising element for me was the performance of Sandra Bullock I ve seen her work mostly in comedy and was thoroughly impressed by her performance I wished she had won Best Actress but since she undeservedly won for The Blind Side back in 10 they wouldn t give it to her now The cinematography is fan bloody tastic the effects are some of the most hypnotic and shockingly convincing I ve seen in any science fiction work and the direction is flawless showing a mastery of mise en scene and composition not seen since the days of Kubrick and Hitchcock The 3D wasn t as mind blowing as say AVATAR or Hugo but it helps envelop viewers in the seriousness of the isolation among the stars I went to see the flick late in its run with a dear friend who exclaimed before the movie began All right impress me Spanish man Afterwards he said simply He won If you haven t seen it yet which is unlikely considering the blockbuster it was Go See It You won t be disappointed by it at all 4 9 5,10
24 December 2014,far away from expectations,Hello everyone this is my first review and I make it because I just saw Gravity and have to share my opinion First of all I won t spoiler anything For the movie sheesh I am not sure why this Film received so many academy awards Indeed the visual effects are nice but the movie is so illogical It is purposely filled with worst case situations that I must admit in the end that it annoyed me The best parts are the beginning and the end of the movie where we people overall mankind can think about some deeper values in our existence But that is unfortunately not enough So dear Mr Clooney and Mrs Bullock who made much better movies in the past I must give you and your team only 5 Points For those who like science and logical plots only watch it if you have too much time And for those who like illogical movies go have fun,5
6 October 2013,"Visually stunning, a surely memorable experience.",When I was a kid once I dreamed to be an astronaut And sometimes my friends like to scare me that astronauts might not get back to Earth for several reasons like running out of oxygen Now I get to see Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floats around in space a situation like once I used to fear Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer doing her first space mission accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney Everything seems smooth and goes as planned until a Russian satellite was destroyed by their own missile and the extremely high speed debris are going Stone and Kowalski s way Out of nowhere shower of the satellite debris come right at them and destroyed their space shuttle leaving them completely alone 600 km above Earth Low on oxygen and jet pack fuel Stone and Kowalski are stranded in zero gravity environment The communications with the terrestrial space command are lost and they have to rely on each other to survive in this extreme environment And in the next 90 minutes their hope on survival could get destroyed by the debris itself And things are gonna get worse believe me One word or two Visually stunning Director Alfonso Cuar n which has been on a hiatus after his last feature film Children of Men made a great comeback with this critically acclaimed survival sci fi drama Gravity soaring on top of Rotten Tomatoes with 98 fresh and a 96 Metascore rating in the first week of the release Cuar n and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki guarantee that you will hold you breath and make your jaw drop for 90 minutes Yep right from the start of the flick a great 13 minute long opening shot starting with a narration to describe how does it feel to be in space Every scene is intense thrilling and makes you feel like you re also stranded with Bullock and Clooney trying to survive no matter how With intense scoring from Steven Price A score cinematography combo covers the simple or I may call it plain storyline While Cuar n can t really develop the story any further the score and beautiful cinematography are what keeping audiences awake and hold their breath There are several survival films out there such as Buried 127 Hours or even the classic Cast Away But they don t give you this 90 minutes full of thrill and seat gripping heart pounding moments that s the point Gravity will make you blown away and rant throughout the film The two main casts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney both Oscars winners showed their true quality in acting Every emotions either it is nauseated nervous scared or even relieved is portrayed flawlessly by Bullock And Clooney He s flamboyant and charming as usual No need to doubt their acting skills Basically Gravity is one of a kind cinematic experience It s designed for you to feel what the main characters are feeling see what they are seeing It s designed to be enjoyed on either IMAX or 4DX while choosing 3D is a must to experience the best It s up to you to choose either a stunning visual on a huge IMAX screen or be part of the movie by choosing the cutting edge 4DX technology Gravity in 4DX is one hell of an experience It s a space simulator with vibrating and moving seats it feels like you re experiencing the same thing happening with Stone Kowalski Not just that sharp wind shots and fogs effect that occur several times during the film add additional enjoyment The 3D itself is amazing and certainly worth the additional bucks Just forget that million dollars space tour and buy a 4DX or IMAX Gravity ticket If you think this Gravity hype is just a buzz it isn t Gravity is so beautiful even in regular non IMAX screens With amazing special effects and shot techniques Gravity is a masterpiece 90 minutes flew so fast as fast as the debris A strong candidate for next year s Oscars Best Pictures nominee and a must see for all you film snobs,9
5 February 2014,Gravity - an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back,Luckily I didn t have any clue about this film before I got to my seat as I would have probably not gone So here are my observations as humble as they are 1 Plot there wasn t one or at least it went over my head Just a lot of panting by Sandra bullock and space debris 2 The panting incredibly annoying and I felt as though I was going to have an asthma attack halfway thru Take a nebuliser with you just in case 3 Unbelievability is that a word An instruction manual for a space ship Pleeeese It was like setting up a new dishwasher Now we know what they do at NASA 4 Lack of character depth I hated them all In fact I wanted them to orbit earth forever 5 Ripley rip off major elements of Alien coming thru as Ms Bullock whimpered around in vest and knickers Exactly the same colour and design as Ripley but nowhere near as well worn as Ms Weaver My closing thoughts why oh why could a crocodile or shark not drag her under and what happened to the aliens I LOVE space films and this was certainly no classic What are the Academy Awards thinking This smells of Clooney nepotism,1
16 November 2013,Making Out with George Clooney,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,5
6 October 2013,Still feeling dizzy right now,I used to dream about floating in space staring at the stars crossing aside and admiring the nebula Nothing can be more halcyon and more enjoyable Now having seen this movie I m glad that I executed the space trek in my dream and not in reality The view is absolutely breathtaking thanks to the CGI the long shot in the beginning is stunning Adding depths and the feeling of room 3D really takes this movie to a whole new level The unexpected coming of debris did hold me back at first However the ever appearing predicaments generate humdrum There are also several scenes that do not make sense for me How can NASA send an astronaut having not successfully driven a re entry module into space How can an astronaut forget to grab tools after using them in space AFTER already losing a hold of a nail once How can a frog stay alive in sea water Moreover the growing pitch occurring every time a door or anything needed to be closed annoys me a little After all it is undoubtedly a good movie with a fresh story and brilliant pictures but it can be better,9
5 October 2013,A Space Movie That Breaks New Ground,Gravity What s ironic is that it s exactly what lacks in almost the entirety of the movie that powerful unseen force which keeps everybody s feet literally on the ground Gravity triumphs on multiple levels From cinematography to special effects to musical scoring to a story so close to home despite the setting so far from it this film breaks new ground or space in movie making Anyone watching it would be left wondering how they managed to get those shots of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock not only from every imaginable angle but also the continuity of certain scenes that would have required lengthy retakes if there had been errors during the shoot which brought to my mind Snake Eyes I d recommend that you watch it in 3D if you really want to have a virtual feel of spacewalking that can give you both that feeling of unease and wonder of being in space the latter being something that really made me even become more in awe of God s creations seeing earth from space with its many visages What s also ironic at least from my experience in watching it is that the immense space can actually make you feel claustrophobic at least from Bullock s point of view The more she drifted away from anything that would keep her from hurtling into deep space the more you ll feel both the vastness of the universe and life slipping away as earth becomes even more out of reach and out of sight And as you feel that seemingly endless blackness engulfing you it s when that sensation of being constricted starts to creep in I hadn t wanted to take anything away from the performances of the main and only actors so as not to dilute the film s overall integrity but Clooney s predictable some would even say annoying smirks and Bullock s familiar panicking her facial expressions are almost a carbon copy of her hysteria while driving a bus with a bomb on board in Speed were uncomfortably close to ruining the experience of watching this brilliant movie Still I give them credit for acting that was mainly dependent on facial expressions since they were in their spacesuits with their helmets on perhaps 95 of the film The moviegoer can easily be taken for an emotional roller coaster ride throughout it Even heard a bit of applause during a scene towards the end of the film where Bullock s character seemed to have conquered impossible odds I must admit I got goose bumps myself watching some of the powerful scenes This movie looked really original I don t remember any film in recent times that captured such intensity and drama in space given only a few elements to work with Admittedly Apollo 13 can perhaps be the closest you can compare it to in terms of movies in space but the filmmaking technology and special effects used in Gravity are for me quite pioneering It s been a quite a while since I last experienced watching a film as enthralling as Gravity Go watch it It s worth every bit of money you pay for it even if you watch it in 3D,9
4 November 2018,Over-rated,Visually it was fairly impressive I have now listed everything good about this movie as it has no other merits My dad loved this movie but he s in his 60 s and easily impressed considering he mostly watches movies and TV shows from the 1970 s and earlier,5

6 October 2013,"""Gravity"" Review",Gravity is a directors film though and through Alfonso Cuaron does a magnificent job of creating the feeling of being in space When I was watching this movie I really felt like I was drifting through space much like the characters as they tumbled and twirled around in the vast emptiness of the unknown There s a lot of quiet and somber moments in this film mostly with the characters floating around and just talking about their life However it s always absorbing As you re drawn into the experience you feel as if you are there with the characters witnessing everything first hand The cinematography is quit brilliant and is a major factor in giving the sense of being in space The camera masterfully spins and turns weightlessly in a way that it would in space without giving a dizzying feeling My breath was also taken away a few times from the sheer beauty of some of the shots and how they were composed The script on the other hand is quit good as well The story of letting go and moving on is handled well with a lot of attention to visual story telling It gives us a real sense of the terrors and loneliness of space a place were our screams can t be heard The themes of letting go are handled very well as we see the characters learn and grow My gripe with the script would have to do with the dialogue Some of the things the characters say either take me out of the film at times or make me feel like its unnecessary The dialogue also sometimes felt like a crutch as it sometimes stated the obvious The cast is incredibly small but it is no short of big names George Clooney as Matt Kowalski gives a solid performance Kowalski is a typical quick talking charmer that Clooney is so accustomed to playing but the character does provide some of the lighter moments in the film The real standout is Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone Ryan has a hard time letting go of the past as she had a terrible tragedy befall her Bullock plays the character well with little quirks of uncertainty and gives us a very likable character that we can all cheer for Visually this film is stunning and a treat for the eyes From one jaw dropping shot composition to the next I was almost always in awe of what I was seeing Space looked incredibly real and Cuaron and crew made everything look so seamless The score isn t bad either It s usually quiet but when something goes down it really aids in the terror and urgency of the situation Not only that but it can also be powerfully moving and uplift as well Overall from a technical stand point Gravity is a masterpiece I was almost always in awe of what I was seeing and a lot of the credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron He really gave us an experience that heightened our senses From masterful cinematography to stunning visual effects it is a treat for the eyes Wonderful and unique shots are spread throughout this film and I really fell like I ve never seen anything like this before The only complain I have for this film is the dialogue While interesting I felt it didn t fit well all the time with what we were watching This movie was at its best when it was quiet I give it an incredibly high 4 5 an experience,8
6 October 2013,"""Gravity"" Transforms",Gravity pulls us in and transforms Sandra Bullock is so powerful in Director Writer Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity perhaps the year s best movie Visually breathtaking to watch I saw it in 3D Cuaron and Cinematographer Emmauel Lubezki simply awe us with the stunning 15 minute continuous camera shot set 6000 miles above the earth However it is Sandra Bullock who authentically pulls us in Cuaron s journey of loss and the rediscovery of our innate power There is a stark moment as she gazes at us from the screen with her sad and haunting beauty saying Who will pray for me Gravity sources its sheer power from its humanity Bullock s bold vulnerability touches and profoundly inspires Bullock and George Clooney s captivating chemistry levitates this tale of the human spirit At the movie s narrative arc Clooney s Matthew Kowalski consoles Bullock s Ryan in the throes of despair His words resonate in a strange twist Clooney basically in a supporting role is brilliant balancing Matt s brashness and deep seeded compassion George is pure partnership in Sandra s tour de force Gravity opens with the NASA Shuttle Explorer Mission to repair the Hubble Telescope orbiting above the earth Bullock with close cropped haircut is bookish Medical Mission Specialist Ryan Stone on her first space walk Isolated Ryan suffers with a family tragedy Clooney is at his gruff and boastful best as Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski Old hat and on his last mission Matt is out to break the space walk record Suddenly the routine mission turns deadly as fiery debris from a Russian Spy Satellite collides with Explorer The unthinkable happens as Ryan becomes un tethered and set adrift in deep space Ryan and Matt now must do the impossible find their way home In space there is no sound but we can hear our hearts pound Director Cuaron captures the isolation and desolation of space He leverages this into the haunting human desolation which lands with us Sandra Bullock s Ryan suffers emotional wounds from the past not to give away In her performance she is also virtually alone Bullock displays awesome physicality as she floats ballet like on screen She looks ageless and amazing as she reclaims her power She lets go of all her defenses and touches our very souls Bullock as Ryan pushes through amidst great fear and loss She has the unique gravitas of moving our souls with a silent glance In this amazing journey she is not the same person at the beginning of the story Neither are we Gravity will amaze and touch you,10
27 October 2013,It's really Sandra Bullock's show,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,
20 December 2019,Very underwhelming,I was very excited for this film however it was majorly disappointing The developing plot seemed to go nowhere and the ending made little effect on my opinion,5
7 May 2014,An overrated but still a Good movie,Rating 7 10 Gravity is a film that although I feel was and is overrated still manages to put together a good drama and with some breathtaking effects I would still recommend this to everyone From a fine director who has only really come from the shadows with this film to a duo that share this film and well Ii must also mention they are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood With it s massive effects come massive affects to the characters and with some speedy space junk to and escape pods everywhere this film guarantees thrilling stuff I felt this film was strongly good and here is why The story is a good one not the finest I could think of but with some great thrills and also spills you are never not gripped to it I felt that the story at times did rely on it s effects and soppy stories of home to fill in the gaps but nevertheless it is a solid story and even if it is kind of simple still makes for pleasant viewing The pace is fast and big and you really don t know what will happen next this one reason rated this slightly higher as predicting what happens around her is near impossible and all down to writing of a great writer and director Sandra Bullock in the main role does a good job if not slightly over dramatic one at times but manages to be great by the end George Clooney as back up seemed nearly too chilled to execute his role well enough and just seemed to float around the entire film without trying to do anything With this there are only ever the two in it which makes for cool viewing as you do in the end get to know quite a bit about them even if the movie is only 91 minutes long good stuff yet again from Cuaron Alfonso Cuaron has to be one of the most underrate directors of our time and I swear he can make any film better than it seems or just generally better His skill with the word is good too and some dialogues I this although not always executed perfectly by the cast is great stuff and his choice of dialogue is intriguing at best I can t not mention the effects which are just massively and crazily big with some sublime work done by the studio behind this the entire thing looks real and on such a scale too just wow one of the best film for effects I have ever seen seriously I do feel this film is overrated like I said although Cuaron is perfect and did deserve his Oscar for his work I got annoyed with Bullocks character and wasn t sure if that was just how Cuaron wanted her to be or Bullock wasn t playing her right I also will add that although the drama is good and thrilling this film offers very little more in terms of anything and I cannot see why it is so highly reviewed as it seriously is nothing special well maybe the effects are but effects don t make an entire movie flawless Those who enjoy space adventures will like it as Gravity is basically what it says on the tin she spins around in the earth s gravity a lot but it makes for good viewing though I think Clooney fans may be disappointed as we don t see loads of him and his screen time is just not enough for him to save himself from his stale performance I know I sound like I hate it but it is actually worth a watch from anyone no matter what type of film you think you like this can be enjoyed Overall I give this a 7 10 meaning it is Strongly a Good film it is very near to being very good but certain factors don t allow it to move upwards to there Don t watch this and say you like it because all critics say they do and because it won Oscars see for yourself I didn t find it great but it was good and personal opinion is everything here One more thing is the score by Steven Price which I am not kidding can make you heart beat faster in the more thrilling parts and also go see this in 3D if you want even more thrills than it already gives,7
26 June 2023,Loved this movie.... Until...,I remember the first time watching this movie one of the very first Blu ray movies I purchased The first 1 3 of movie was pure nail biting adrenaline for me because I thew that the science behind it was accurate Pushing the boundaries or reality maybe but that s just great storytelling Then we get to the George Clooney part where he s sacrificing himself and all the tension they had built up to that point made me feel deflated and took some time to get me reengage with the movie Overall this is an excellent movie that is probably the most accurate to what the dangers associated with space travel is like their use of sound and it s absence is so awesome There s a scene where our heroine enters the ISS and as the airlock is getting represurized you can hear the claxon gradually getting louder and louder When she s in space all you hear is her breathing These little audio cue s helped me enjoy the movie and stand out All in all this would be a great binge watch with The Martin both are based on the same philosophy Work through each problem that is brought up and you work your way through all of them you ll make your way home Compared to the Martian this movie is able to hold its own in the despite predicament storyline but I ll give the Matt Damon movie slightly higher score for two reasons The limitations of making that one realistic enough because of budget reasons made the looking past the lack of realism easy to do but what they missed in realism Matt made up for in acting This movie they had set the bar so high in realism that the one place where they ruined it for me was such a cold splash of water in the face during the first watch it took several minutes for me to get back into the movie That s not to say that Saundra is a bad actor in this movie she s actually quite good but some scenes that Matt had you could feel his desperation and his joy Saundra you was convinced she was scared angry frustrated etc but you didn t feel it,8
13 November 2013,"Well Galileo and Isaac theorized about it, but last night I experienced it.",I really want to convey how thoroughly enjoyable this movie was but at the same time I don t wish to gush over it The reason being that if anyone was reading my review with the thought of watching the film it is possible to build something up too much and precipitate disappointment So no hyperbole just a cool clear opinion delivered with an almost scientific emotional detachment 1 Ask a question to whit should I go and watch Gravity the new science fiction thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney 2 Conduct research and make observations Which I did after reading up on this movie the consensus seemed to be a favourable one I had also observed previous efforts by the actors involved and had enjoyed them 3 Propose a hypothesis The theory being that it would be to my benefit to drag my TV loving backside down to the local purveyor of IMAX entertainment and watch this film 4 Design an experiment to test this hypothesis Plans were quickly drawn to rendezvous at 19 45 BST at the Odeon for a screening of the entertainment 5 Test the hypothesis I watched the movie 6 Collate results and draw conclusions to support or reject you hypothesis The results were that I had a fantastic evenings entertainment Watching a tense thrilling tale of two astronauts left stranded by a terrible accident in orbit two hundred miles above the Earth I concluded that the fantastic performances given by the two leads in the piece combined with assured and innovative direction from Alfonso Cuaron and some dizzying special effects on the IMAX screen produced a infrequently experienced yet palpable sensation within me that for the purposes of this experiment I choose to call thrilled to bits I strongly suggest you conduct your own experiment as I did in relation to the subject matter I feel confident you will draw the same conclusions I did I did notice that some people here on IMDb seemed to have drawn somewhat muddled results from their experimentation in this area Their conclusions were tainted by perceived scientific and procedural inaccuracies within the film Having a limited knowledge of these things I could not hope to debate these issues on any kind of an equal footing SPOILER ISH That said I did read a vehement technical complaint in relation to something completely scientifically impossible that occurs in a scene which is well established as a dream sequence I ll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that,10
10 December 2013,'lost in the moment',I feel I must make clear that I had never seen a 3d movie ever and this is only because my theater wont take my free tickets for the 3d viewings it s a principle thing before I went to see Gravity on the big screen in 3d WHAT A RUSH Never in 30 years or so of being a movie buff have I ever experienced a trill like that I was mesmerised by the crisp clean and ever so realistic show of this film I felt almost as if I was there amongst the chaos and desolate empty space that I have had a fascination with for so many years Dodging debris holding my breath gripping the armrests floating in zero gravity with grace and tranquility The whole concept of virtual reality is something that I am very excited about in the coming years in regard to movies And if this movie is just the tip of the iceberg of what we can expect I reckon I m going to be watching many more 3d movies I can t wait Although I have no comparison to bear on never having seen a 3d even I could say with certainty that this is quite a special movie experience The movie itself was quite a ride Essentially a survival tale beating the odds overcoming your own personal demons to increase your chances for survival I m sure there is some hidden deeper meaning to this film but in all honesty it slipped by me I was just too engrossed in the film to notice I must give huge kudos to Sandra Bullock I was mightily impressed with the way she handled this mission Always thinking that she was OK for an actress Not great but just OK This was definitely her shining moment I could feel her panic because I was panicking as well When she cried I cried when she triumphed I was there cheering for her This was absolutely the Sandra Show George Clooney had a good supporting role as the voice of sanity and calm and even a small amount of humor Being a huge sci fi buff a lot of the technical jargon was not lost on me I know how things move in space Fast destructive and threatening I am very aware of the challenges that are faced when leaving the earth s atmosphere which made it all the more trilling for me because I got it I m going to give this movie a 5 5 rating For me it was something original scary exciting touching and so much more And a new experience in movie watching for me It s a shame that I will never get to see it in 3d again unless I buy a 70inc 3d t v which ain t gonna happen anytime soon but I am equally excited to watch it again in 2d it will be interesting to see what the difference will be especially on the small screen I will recommend this movie to anyone in particular sci fi fans like me I know that it will get many repeat viewings over the years It is as close to going to outer space as I will ever get,10
26 March 2015,Save me Keanu!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,
5 September 2014,Yawn,A total waste of time except for some of the acting Bullock and special effects Plot so weak as to almost be non existent many incongruous events dialog no better than that expected of a B movie I am SO glad I didn t waste money viewing this and waited until it was broadcast As stated some of the special effects were amazing but others were downright insulting to the intelligence of those who aren t mesmerized by actor s over rated reputations Clooney was weak to the point of being irrelevant The directing was at best amateurish The necessity of having 10 lines in order to qualify for submission is much like this movie stupid,1
27 October 2013,Gravity - An IMAX 3D Experience Review,First of all let me just start by saying that I m a huge fan of Alfonso Cuar n s work and that for about 1 hour and half I just felt I was right there in space Gravity was one of the most promising movies of this season and without any doubt it was successful This space epic about two astronauts George Clooney and Sandra Bullock who are lost in space after a huge explosion in space is full of action and impressive special effects After James Cameron s Avatar I have never thought there could be a movie with greater special effects but I was wrong The mix between the well written storyline and the special effects make this an Oscar nominee for sure Gravity is definitely one of the best movies of the year and the proof that sometimes 3D can improve our movie experience The IMAX Experience of Gravity just made the movie more amazing than it is In conclusion Alfonso Cuar n s new movie is one of those which I expect that years from now people will talk about Gravity scores 10 out of 10 IMAX Experience Review Sound 8 10 Visual Effects 10 10 3D 9 10 IMAX Experience Score 9 10 IMAXWORTHIT,10
22 May 2017,Don't let go of this movie!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
5 October 2013,Brilliant!,Can t stop thinking about it Very well done with a terrific grasp of the unique perspective of space no friction no gravity no sound orbital dynamics Small cast breathtaking scenes and precision sound along with great attention to detail I wasn t sure I d like Bullock and Clooney in this technical story but they were outstanding I m betting Bullock and special effects get Oscar noms Yes there were some Hollywood liberties but overall B verisimilitude Felt like I was there A short movie but I m glad the director didn t try to add to it perfect as is more would dilute the impact My non 3D wife admits 3D is the way to go Don t miss this one,10

29 March 2014,I want my $1.20 back,I got this at Redbox and it was the worst 1 20 I ever spent This movie is unbelievably awful on every level known to man Save your money and go to the dollar store instead If you have nothing to do and need to watch something watch QVC instead a test pattern is more interesting than this excuse of a movie The only reason I can think of that people watched this is to see George Clooney and Sandra B They should be ashamed to take money for this movie I suppose the reason they chose to be in this is to continue their income stream It is best watched with the sound off on the TV actually with the TV off would be a better way to see this movie Turn off the TV and vacuum the carpet instead it will be more fun,
6 October 2013,A very good but simple movie,I went into Gravity not really knowing what to expect I had seen the trailer and wondered if there was more to it than just a couple of people trapped in space Gravity is beautifully filmed well paced believable and immersive but it is a very simple premise I was never bored or frustrated by Gravity but I was waiting to be surprised by it and that never happened I have seen many cases of this movie being compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey While both movies present a believable space experience 2001 A Space Odyssey had far more imagination vision and depth 2001 A Space Odyssey presented imaginative ideas and concepts that inspired the viewers own imaginations and thoughts I don t think 2001 A Space Odyssey is a perfect movie but in those ways it is superior to Gravity Gravity creates a more immersive space experience it feels real it looks real and in that way it is better but if you are looking for something more than that I don t think you will find it here There is some interesting symbolism and undertones about life and death that add an extra layer to the movie but it isn t amazing Gravity does what it does incredibly well It doesn t really do anything wrong the visuals are gorgeous the soundtrack is atmospheric the effects are realistic and the performances are genuine This is an example of a movie that fires on all cylinders but its just a bit too simple to be phenomenal Other films could learn a lot from Gravity but I don t think Gravity has enough imagination to be counted among the greatest movies of all time Gravity should be experienced in theatres it is a great space experience and I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone,8
18 April 2014,"In space, no-one notices a farce",Coincidence and luck tend to work in fast moving terrestrial action films where the event is at least plausible and the action moves on before your logic can gainsay it But in the vastness of space not even one long shot is reasonable let alone a sequence of them In space if something has to pass by something else at a distance of a few metres or hit it by luck then it isn t going to happen even once Yet this film s plot is constructed from little more than impossible coincidences whose only purposes are first to threaten and thereafter keep the lead actress alive Better she get killed off early and move on with something more believable like aliens running windows compatible software a la Independence Day,3
5 November 2013,Visuals To Awe Over,This is an amazing visual and sci fi film It may not be the best film of the year or the best script and substance but the visuals are amazing and that is enough to be simply entertaining which is often all we need to bring us to the theater It will definitely take the Oscars for its visual effects no doubt The story is decent The acting is good Sandra Bullock and George Clooney never perform badly Is it the best acting of their careers Of course not But it isn t meant to be either Definitely worth a watch I didn t feel like my money was stolen from me like many trips to the theater and lets face it the costs of a movie ticket now a days is deterring to begin with As a filmmaker myself it is something to worry about Nonetheless it is more entertaining than most films coming out week after week,9

17 October 2013,watch in 3d,The visuals of the film are amazing in 3d watched it yesterday and the whole time in the cinema i didn t take my eyes off the screen I thought the story could have been better and would have liked to have felt a bit more atmosphere of being lost in space in the film rather than Sandra bullocks sob story about her kid which started to annoy me a little especially when she was talking about finding her shoe and talking to herself i would have liked to have seen more fear and claustrophobia instead to give the viewer a real sense of being lost in space No matter what the story line is like the visuals make up for just make sure you watch it in 3d to get the best possible experience,7
13 November 2013,This is a must see.,This is one of the best films i have seen all year by far The effects were incredible and the 3D really enhanced them to a great degree The story was pretty simple and it worked so very well The theory behind the main storyline made sense in what they were trying to avoid Both key roles were exceptional and the story really allowed both characters to develop so very well Yes there were a few exemptions to this theory of realism but they were very few from which you might expect to find more in a Space movie This is in my opinion the best space movie I have ever seen in my days of watching these kind off films It has the best effects of every movie this year bar a few The acting was built up so very well and what they did made sense most of the time All in all if you call yourself a movie fan that I would definitely take the time to check this out and see what you make of it,9

24 June 2019,A Wonderful Movie,Such a great movie with a terrific cast DID NOT DISAPPOINT me at all Great storyline,10
19 January 2014,Best Sci-fi Movie of 2013,In my own point of view Gravity is one of the best Sci fi movies made in Hollywood Probably it s the best Sci fi movie after Inception Sandra Bullock as Dr Stone does a great job and she is absolutely amazing and convincing in her every single scene If anybody deserves Oscar for this year the most it most definitely is her George Clooney has done a fine job too but I hoped to see more of him in the movie Among all that fascinated me most was the perfect cinematography and sound editing Those guys work is flawless I so much loved watching the movie and my one and half hours were well spent I hope you enjoy it too,9
21 November 2013,Atmospheric! Must see in 3D,Walked out of the cinema feeling like I had experienced something more than just a movie Hats off to everyone involved in bringing this to the big screen I have never been a fan of 3D but this is the type of movie 3D was made for You literally feel like your up there among the stars with the characters Which leads me to the cast Again I have never been a fan of Sandra Bullock and grumbled immensely when she picked up her Oscar however in this movie she excels Some reviews have said that the storyline is weak I strongly disagree This isn t Dawson s Creek no ones watching for a phsycoanalysis of the characters A sub plot with a ton of dialect is definitely not needed Also some reviews have complained about the musical score Ridiculous I don t often gush over any movie see other reviews but with Gravity I couldn t wait to share my thoughts The must see of the year,10

21 July 2014,Good Idea But Very Annoying at Times; Especially Sandra Bullock,Sandra Bullocks character is excessively annoying clumsy and a nuisance while clooney is so excessively calm to the point where it doesn t even seem plausible The first 1 3 of the movie is dominated by Sandra Bullocks excessive hyper ventalating like breathing patterns and mini panic attacks The second 1 3 of the movie is her basically screwing up and or breaking everything she comes into contact with The other thing that bugged me was that everything seems to be CGI nothing looks quite real at all Anyway the idea of the film seemed good to me I haven t seen anything quite like this movie though I do not watch a lot of movies So if you can get past these annoyances I d say its worth the watch,6
4 October 2013,"If you're a cinephile, this one's for you.",Gravity challenges convention with its brilliantly bold and refreshingly simple plot a disaster during a space shuttle repair leaves two astronauts adrift in space And they must fight to return to earth End Gravity is unchallenging to watch and is bound by the uncomplicated mission of putting the reliance on the viewer to make the difference This movie is about the intimate inextricable relationship between challenge and reward The script has been honed within an inch of its life and actually has a surprising amount of heart Sandra Bullock and George Clooney rise to the occasion with aplomb No small feat considering the story s brilliantly executed shifts from white suspense to emotional density Bullock in particular has an immense screen presence in this film and somehow manages to outshine the breathtaking cinematography This is her best performance yet and she deserves gold statuette nom The camera work is vintage Cuaron Gravity is blessed with his trademark excruciatingly long cut free scenes with pivoting panorama motions It s disorienting unnerving and it fits the atmosphere perfectly I love that Gravity s character is so transparent It cannot be any other film than an Alfonso Cuaron film Gravity is discreetly and unbearably tense with a runaway train sensation in the way it builds up suspense nothing frantic just a no nonsense rush that just builds and builds If you re prone to addictions Gravity will turn you into a suspense junkie What s amazing is the scale of the pyrotechnics tension emotions prowess and how beautifully they combine Gravity is hugely impressive without any single element dominating the experience everything rises in unison I m not sure such brutal calculation of response has ever been coupled to such emotional intimacy Gravity is simply a breathtaking experience Here and now in the immediate aftermath this is one of the greatest films ever And for that I owe Alfonso Cuaron an eclipse inducing debt of gratitude,9
7 October 2013,"Words can't do this justice. Easily one of the best movies of the year, an absolute must see & the best 3D movie I've ever seen. I say A+",I hate space Ryan Stone Bullock is a medical engineer who is working in space on an experiment She is up there with astronaut Matt Kowalski on his last mission and trying to break the space walk record When ground control warns them of incoming debris Stone thinks she can finish before they are hit She is wrong When a rouge particle hits the arm she is on she becomes detached from the shuttle and her crew Floating alone in space she does everything she can to make it back home safe This is a hard movie to review The main reason is because I don t want to give anything away This is one of if not the most tense movie I think I have ever seen Five minutes into the movie the action starts and doesn t stop until the end I found myself white knuckled and holding my breath almost the entire time There are very few movies that I have a hard time talking about This is one of them Words can t do this justice This is easily one of the best movies of the year an absolute must see and the best 3D movie I have ever seen Overall nothing else to say but WOW Watch this I give it an A,10

26 January 2014,An Impressive Waste of Time,After having viewed the trailers for this movie I was a bit skeptical but chose to give the film the benefit of a doubt It quickly became evident that the rave critical reviews were a load of crap designed to prevent Hollywood producers from losing their shirts The premise that sets up Bullock s character is plausible but the storyline goes downhill fast It appears the entire goal of this film was to showcase Bullock s minimal acting talents and 49 year old sculpted body George Clooney was added to draw the female demographic to the theaters period The opening sequence was largely borrowed from Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey As for the remaining scenes the amount of suspended disbelief required to see this flick through to the end will require the viewer to have an understanding of physics often demonstrated by famed cartoon character Wiley Coyote The statistical likelihood of Bullock s character surviving the situations that occur would be similar to the same person winning the Powerball for six consecutive drawings This film joins Blood Beach on a list of worst films ever made,1
30 December 2013,Stunning,Visually this film is just stunning Personally I tend to steer clear of 3D movies feeling them a bit of a gimmick but seeing this in the cinema was like looking through a window back at the Earth In general it s a life affirming film against a stunning backdrop and don t be put off by reviewers who will try and patronise with a couldn t happen attitude true the complete storyline is at best un plausible and at worst outrageously exaggerated but it s 91 minutes well spent The experience heightened by the soundtrack is something quite special See it before it leaves the cinema I went back to see it a second time something I never do,9
9 September 2018,An underrated masterpiece,I ts hard to believe at least for me but a lot of user reviews seem to describe Gravity as 1 a visually stunning movie and that s all or 2 a simply bad one Don t misunderstand me it is a visually stunning movie but that s just the surface Gravity is a movie about grieving process It s a story about a woman who physically and figuratively lost in a cold and hostile universe has to deal with her inner demons and learns to let go and forgive herself Notice that the movie is split in two by a scene showing her naked and cowering in fetal position that s a rebirthing In my opinion Gravity is one of the most touching well written and original pieces of cinematography of the XXI century,10
10 January 2014,Revolutionary.,Spanish director Alfonso Cuaron returns pushing the technological boundaries within cinema in his box office smash hit Gravity Cuaron s already impressive filmography which contains films like Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban perhaps has its most impressive creation This film demands to be seen in 3D something which I didn t think I d ever be saying Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney and novice medical engineer Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock are carrying out a technical mission in space when disaster hits and the accumulative debris of many destroyed satellites kills their colleagues and destroys their shuttle Adrift in space where nothing can carry sound and it s impossible to live the two must work together and overcome their inner demons in order to survive The undoubtedly mind blowing special effects and the technical ambition and mastery of the whole production are of course Gravity s main assets Massively entertaining and engaging set pieces in which destructive debris storms wreak havoc are unlike anything ever witnessed in the history of cinema What was so impressive about these set pieces though was the way that director Alfonso Cuaron chose to handle them A lesser director of big box office films such as Michael Bay would ve chosen to ignore the fact that sound doesn t carry in space in favour of creating a film with loud and overblown action set pieces However in the very capable hands of cerebral director Alfonso Cuaron this scientific fact isn t ignored and is instead used to magnify the suspense and horror of these explosions that occur under a foreboding backdrop of unsettling silence Steven Price s suspenseful score and the 3D technology are further tools utilised by Cuaron to create this jaw dropping horror story Sandra Bullock gives the best performance of her career in the lead role conveying the sad and disconnected nature of Ryan Stone well She also reacts in a convincing manner as a person faced with an inconceivably horrifying situation Co star George Clooney was a perfect casting choice and is able to lend his charmed personality to the role of the chatty and enthusiastic veteran Matt Kowalski with inconsummate ease Keeping with the theme of great casting choices the decision to cast Ed Harris as the voice of mission control was a nice heads up to the similarities between Gravity and space survival thriller Apollo 13 which Harris starred in Gravity is very easy to view from a thematic standpoint as the film is essentially one long allegory The emptiness and isolation of being in outer space is meant to be a reflection of the emptiness and isolation in lead character Ryan Stone s life on Earth which she carries as a result of her very traumatic past George Clooney s chatty astronaut Matt Kowalski is a representation of your everyday person getting on with and enjoying life It is this sort of influence that Ryan needs to give her the will to survive and return to Earth The basic message of the film is that life must continue no matter what tragedy you ve encountered in the past However for all of the high praise that Gravity deserves there are some underlying problems with the film Despite being better than initially expected the writing is nowhere near the quality of the writing in the other excellent films that Gravity has been bracketed with in the lead up to the major awards ceremonies Brilliant writing and memorable dialogue are essential factors in determining whether a film is a classic or not and while Gravity has a better script than most blockbusters the writing needs to be better in parts Furthermore the film lulls a bit in between its spectacular action set pieces and this partly derives from the fact that some of the writing isn t quite engaging enough to fully sustain the audience s attention Ultimately Gravity is a revolutionary survival horror blockbuster whose impact will be as keenly felt in the future as that of masterpiece The Matrix Its two strong lead performances and refreshingly short run time largely help to overcome the problem of a script that isn t up to the scratch of 2013 s other exceptional films However Gravity more than earns its place among these elite efforts,9
2 March 2014,A movie where it's very hard to suspend disbelief,If this movie was fantasy or set in another universe or science and realism were just brushed to the side I could enjoy it But it s not It s a movie that depends on its realism focuses on it and utterly fails at it First high school physics From the basic premise to the minute to minute action to the conclusion this movie depends on physics And one thing this movie fails at completely is physics Both the initiating event and the final heroic sacrifice are completely unsupportable and end up being annoying and distracting rather than emotional because of it The movie also fails at the geography of space putting objects thousands of miles away within spitting distance in fact the initial premise of the movie depends on this failed geography two objects thousands of miles away from each other being in exactly the same orbit And then they set up the main character as a nearly untrained emotionally disturbed woman without any special skills There is never a convincing reason given for her being there The qualifications for being a fully mission integrated astronaut are exacting and the only way I can see anyone getting around them would be as a PR stunt or if someone was a top level expert who would be valuable to the mission in some special way So far as we can tell she s not a PR stunt and she s not a mission critical expert She s just there And after sticking her there for no apparent reason the movie depends on her inexperience and lack of training to add tension and advance the story It s ridiculous I find it completely impossible to take the movie seriously when it seems every plot point turns on something unbelievably unrealistic The high budget a list actors and high quality special effects make it watchable but nothing could make it enjoyable,4

7 September 2019,Lost in clichés,Some stunning shots and sound but sadly that s pretty much it It s lightyears away from other movies which take place in space such as Apollo 13 First Man The Martian or crazier ones like 2001 Space Odyssey Interstellar Sunshine Event Horizon Armageddon heck even Space cowboys whatever you name it anything is likely better I guess people were happy to see Sandra Bullock on the big screen along with George Clooney They both played their role well but their characters are typical clich s If you like shallow stories without real plot that try to be deep with implausible events happening one after another I guess you ll like it For the rest don t waste your time I d give it a 5 for the shots and technical breakthroughs but I m baffled from the high scores this movie received and trying like many others to give this movie the score it deserves 6 at most,1
8 November 2013,Predictable script and bad acting,The film is a waste of time Sandra Bullock plays an irritating character compounded with bad acting she should stick to comedies Clooney plays a typical Hollywood clich hero with some of the worst lines i have had to endure in a long time No plot no special effects no direction just very predictable Waste of time and money In this day and age of technology I have higher expectations This film comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere There has not been much thought about plot or depth of any character considering there are only two actors I would not even class this film as science fiction as there is nothing very innovative nor any attempt to stretch your imagination,1

5 October 2013,Stuck and Lost in Space.,Just watched the much buzzed about Gravity I must say it s a sprawling space drama of an atmosphere tone It s not typical science fiction with monsters and creatures still the scenes let a viewer explore the outer world by seeing the scenes of space puts an ever lasting picture in one s mind The shots and style of camera angles from director Alfonso Cuaron is done in a beautiful way from seeing the two primary characters in orbit to seeing different parts of the space shuttle craft and compartments as they float all thru the picture Now for a little story background George Clooney plays Matt a veteran astronaut who while up in space has Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a medical engineer on hand who has taken her first voyage into space And Ryan is a lady that still has a tragic past attached to her as she still remembers her daughter s death As the film glides thru all of a sudden the space drama gets full when a Russian satellite explodes causing a reaction and showers of debris that comes at the two central characters Then no ship the two are lost in orbit Watching the film in 3 D will connect you as the viewer even more adrift thru space overall Gravity is a decent space drama of character and survival,7
16 September 2017,see it once for the FX,Meh Okay I went into this after hearing all the raves as to how realistic this movie was about being in space Well special effects are great but they do not make a good movie Too many plot holes and scientific flaws to really forgive On the microscale the zero gravity stuff is pretty accurate except of course Bullocks perfect hair and the views of earth are stunning but the basic physics and mechanics of re entry and the improbable ending on a planet that is 75 water and dozens more physics flaws you can read about elsewhere if interested that taken as a whole make the plot so ludicrous it insults your intelligence I mean it starts from the get go when Stone refuses to stop what she is doing and get to safety err ohhtayy sounds plausible for a well educated but novice astronaut And then the ending And why does every action movie have to have a happy ending If you watch it and pretend that after Matt Kowalsky reappears that Dr Stone is actually dying and hallucinating then the plot thereafter is tolerable Otherwise I would put this in the same category as Avatar See it once for the effects and check your brain at the door Oh and Hollywood please stop hiring actresses who have botoxed themselves so much that they resemble elves from LOTR The odd somewhat inhuman facial contortions are truly disturbing when viewed on the big screen,4
29 January 2022,Great visually but boring,This really is an experience A very unique yet fitting filming style along with great sound and some stunning visuals make this into a very immersive experience However I just found the film pretty boring Maybe I just wasn t in the mood for this type of film but in general I found both the plot and the characters pretty boring and uninteresting,5

5 October 2013,This film wins.,This movie wins I cried at least five times during the film just from the breathtaking jaw dropping groundbreaking cinema I was watching The action is intense The acting is perfect The dialogue was a little weak but there was barely any of it anyways The special effects were seamless Cuar n and his crew create a piece of film that is so brilliant I am not sure I ever want to watch another movie as there is zero sum possibility that it could stack up against this work of art Every time I think that the film could take a wrong turn it defies expectations and creates a beautiful flower The literal paintings of the visuals canvas of this movie could be watched for days on end The sense of place and of course the sense of space three dimensional space is laser focused and melts my brain as Cuar n achieves through story visuals and sound in this 131 minute film what every filmmaker wishes they could achieve He is a master of the medium there is nothing that we see that is not perfectly intentional An auteur The music is chilling The pace moves quickly and makes your heart race and yet he allows for those most essential contrasts of stillness and silence Bullock and Clooney s instant charm and chemistry don t exactly hurt the flick either From the first frame until the last powerful moment of gravity this movie makes me believe in a higher power Alfonso Cuar n Master of Cinema,10
24 June 2022,CG Centered Script That Should Stay In the Empty Void Of Space.,One of the biggest rules in film is to create a meaningful and timeless script that isn t based on something that will be easily outdated This is meant includes the visuals as well so that the film you make withstands the test of time Besides it s gorgeous for its time graphics the film has really no substance and a heavy lack in research First off the film focuses mostly on its achievements in CG which is impressive yes which is why I give it 3 stars however it will no doubt look fake to future audiences as it already does to most visual effects editors nowadays Think about the Neo vs 100 Agent Smiths from The Matrix Reloaded 2003 or really any scene Looked good at the time but looks fake now really any CG from the film Luckily it was the story that carried that film not its graphics There is nothing from Gravity that makes me want to ever rewatch it again even though I did my duty as a reviewer and watched it twice Second it s attention to detail might help engage the viewer but the unrealistic physics how characters interact and the particles that hit the ISS seemingly unexperienced astronauts and their lack in protocol and their lack of an actual purpose for being outside of the ISS Just ruins it Finally all of it together is kind of a slap in the face to real astronauts and gives a bad false viewpoint of how astronauts would handle situations makes them look unprofessional and makes Sandra Bullock look like a fool instead of having someone powerful and experienced like the real life Peggy Whitson kicking ass and taking names Instead we get to watch Sandra float around helplessly and cowardly for nearly the entire runtime of the film I am starting to see a trend in Bullock s recent movies Long winded pretentious story with an unrelatable character and it ends anticlimactically Some might think my review harsh but as a filmmaker it shames me to know writer directors get big budgets and huge name actors just to create a film that lacks in research has no investment in its story and doesn t really care about anything besides its CG appeal,3
24 November 2019,Wow!,All I can say I wish I hadn t missed it at the cinema Visually stunning and incredibly eventful and never boring got me glued and lately it doesn t happen that often The problem of space debris is well known and the premise that a big disaster creates a volley of missiles travelling at several km s that can hit you out in space doing some serious damage is realistic I also like that there are no other people than George Clooney and Sandra Bullock And the movie ends without any cavalry coming to the rescue,10

23 October 2013,Dazzling visuals and tale of human will,The human will to survive catastrophe has been depicted in various elements While Castaway was about the desperate attempt to get off an island Life of Pi was about getting onto one Mountaineers sailors disaster survivors and characters genuinely lost have battled natural elements and phenomena to delineate the human will that defeats all odds What director Alfonso Cuaron Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban Children of Men does now is suspend a human in an environment of void against some spectacular backdrop occasionally exposed to threatening objects with the challenge to survive and find a way back home Gravity soars on the technical genius of a visionary film maker and his incredible team that creates the adventure in the great spatial void while masking the logic science and pragmatism with which two astronauts struggle to survive flying debris and vacuum Sandra Bullock is Dr Ryan Stone who is awkwardly on a space outing to repair parts of the Hubble telescope along with Matt Kowalski George Clooney and the funny Indian astronaut who met a quick fateful end The Rom Com specialist doesn t have to deal with much Speed this time around but rather prolonged silence desperation and inexperience of maneuvering in space The funny conversations and meticulous processes of repair are abruptly halted by NASA s command to abort the mission due to some flying debris being closer to them than was originally conceived Russia s missile launch onto their own satellite resulted in this havoc in space that led to severe and totalitarian destruction of human objects around Earth s orbit With their shuttle suffering carnage by the flying debris Ryan spins over and over desperate for balance semblance and reserve until the cool headed Matt attaches himself to her with a cord as he cruises along toward the I S S with his thrusters As the communication with mission control is broken and their oxygen levels run low Matt maintains positivity with his corny conversations punchlines and his endearing gallantry a result of which leaves Ryan little time hope and options With the debris completing its rotation every 90 mins Dr Stone must find a pod from one of the space stations that can take her back to Earth gravity and home Much of the drama in space is accompanied by spells of silence emptiness and Ryan talking to herself The thrills are provided by the struggles of moving in space and of course the oncoming debris that creates havoc Thus one would think that for the most part Cuaron s focus would be on character building plot progression emotions in precarious situations and alluring powers of a strong cast that can enthrall audiences against the dark background of space Instead the director chooses to cast two of the foremost Rom Com actors in lead roles When Sandra Bullock isn t gasping for the scarce oxygen she still sounds as panic stricken as she did when she had to make a sharp turn in a bus speeding at 80mph George Clooney may have the voice that warrants attention but his charm seems a bit out of this world in the context One has a difficult time relating to these actors whose backgrounds are solely in their own memory their body language is only that of suspension in vacuum in a space suit and then there s one more element that doesn t quite help them With its sheer lack of life Space does not offer much in thrills excitement or the unexpected Ang Lee had a tiger a hyena whales birds rodents and storms that challenged Pi on his boat ride Tom Hanks had weather starvation injuries boat building fire making and fishing as challenges Ryan does have to find her way into a pod and release it from a station but the only threat really is that of the flying debris The rest of us mortal beings who haven t been in space cannot relate to the challenges of maneuvering in space getting in and out of a suit breathing inside the helmet on depleted O2 or understanding Russian and Chinese equally well to control space stations That s precisely where Cuaron uses the best of modern film technologies to captivate audiences and overcome such issues The Cuarons have written a tight storyline that doesn t just wander in space If the action isn t frequent the sense of its coming surely is There is no back story of the actors nor is there a flashback of their memories From the beginning Gravity pulls you into space and impresses you with its visuals and excitement when the astronaut has barely any metal to grab onto for dear life Many of those moments can make you clench your fist and that s exactly where the film leaves its mark As unreal as it seems the film makers have convinced us that we are really up there suspended in space faced with flying debris and barely a handle to hold on to The post production work on 3D is good yet non overbearing Its main contribution is the flying debris that comes onto you but other than that the great void doesn t have any object jumping out of the screen to impress with 3D Alfonso Cuaron has directed a well paced storyline with an exemplary vision realized by a very talented technical team that quite literally takes us beyond our realm The story s linear nature and pace release the pressure from actors to portray more emotion and movement than required It could very well be Sandra Bullock s best performance but that s not really setting any standards is it In the end however Gravity is about the triumph of human will to survive and endure through its adversities even though it seems to fall

10 October 2013,Does not deserve to even sniff the top 250,Went to see this the other night with very high expectations and left highly disappointed This films graphics and special effects are very beautiful and realistic looking but that s about all it has going for it There is virtually no plot just one person roaming through space with one thing going wrong after another Apparently there are a lot of scientific mistakes none that I saw because I am ignorant on the subject so if you re a science stickler avoid this movie Overall if you want to see this movie to experience superb picture and a feeling of being in outer space it could be a good watch If you re looking to be entertained and see a top 250 worthy plot you will leave disappointed and 10 bucks poorer,6
23 November 2013,Space 1999,The limited talents of the Hollywood stars fit perfectly into this minimally plotted survival film And if there has been a more faithful depiction of space I haven t seen it The little saccharin needed for this otherwise austere show to be swallowed by a studio executive is quite forgivable Along with Avatar this film knows why it is using 3D It allows the eye to pick out details like a coming astronaut without camera tricks One of the attractions is one and a half hours of simplicity In the current film world of back stories jump cuts twists side plots non linearity etc I have to admit this makes a welcome break In many ways this film is a throwback to previous decades Within the bounds of what this film offers it delivers everything with aplomb With so little to distract from the survival plot you could argue that the film has few ways to fall of the rails But it is up to the director to select his target and execute against it,8
16 December 2020,"Far more action-packed than imagined, and that's really good.",From the reception I thought Gravity would be a slow burning somber drama about survival and the boredom that accompanies it I was wrong thanks to IMDb This is an exciting full fledged action movie instead It s relentlessly fast paced mixing explosive space action with subtle human drama and tension Sandra Bullock totally dominates the film with her realistic controlled performance George Clooney is also impressive his character is written well and makes its presence felt But yeah the CGI team also deserve props for their fantastic work which is indeed best enjoyed in 3D Director Alfonso Cuar n impresses not just with his direction but also with his successful reuse of the long take technique that first left viewers enthralled in Children of Men 2006 another sci fi action masterpiece The film doesn t eschew character drama it just avoids overdosing the film with it There are a few emotional moments too done with subtlety The sound is another major positive of Gravity just like its certain visual moments of symbolism You don t have to read reviews but see the film to believe it And trust me you ve got to see this in 3D Whenever objects flew towards the camera a rather old trick for 3D effects I couldn t help but blink as if the objects were going to hit my eye for real And of course it s edited brilliantly Action packed to the brim Gravity is a perfect mix of excitement and emotion You don t have to be well versed in science to enjoy Gravity a spectacular sci fi action blockbuster that doesn t try to be too many things at the same time It s fun fun and more fun But again those expecting heavy drama or character development might find this a mere spectacle than anything else So expect a fun action spectacle set in space accompanied by some good character drama and tension That s what Gravity truly is and its simple yet beautiful message of never giving up resonates at the end,10

18 November 2013,As good as a Clooney/Bullock movie can get,To be honest a space adventure with Clooney and Bullock did sound very unappealing However the experience of the film is mostly a positive one Two astronauts are in the process of repairing a damaged vessel when the debris of a destroyed spaceship hits them with the rest of the film being about their struggle for survival in zero gravity conditions Whilst great job has been done to keep the audience engaged throughout several questions will ultimately be raised on the plausibility of certain events although it is mostly a film about survival in alien conditions Ultimately this is a very mixed bag of impressions Good film but without sharing the prevailing enthusiasm,7
30 October 2013,Great visual experience with minor momentum moments.,Gravity is an instance visual experience with great performances from Oscar winning actors and occasional silliness that can kill the momentum Sandra Bullock brings her A game both in acting and in the physique department sending a clear message to young Hollywood lionesses that she is still the head huntress Clooney is as usual killing it for all us single guys with his suave persona and wine like looks that seem to get better with age His calm yet imposing demeanor makes him a good mentor figure guiding Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock through an almost hopeless situation The back and forth between the two was a pleasant distraction from impending disaster Like in any disastrous situation the experienced will calm and guide the rookies throughout the ordeal The conversation between the two reveals a sad story of Ryan Stone s life which made it easier to sympathize with her and root for her even more Gravity looks absolutely breathtaking and for the first time I sat through a 3D movie without headaches or constant struggle between 3D and my actual glasses for space on the bridge of my nose The movie does 3D right creating an immersive environment in which dodging space debris almost feels instinctive The ever presence of Earth in the backdrop is both scary and humbling creating an odd sense of wonder and insignificance Gravity could have been a near perfect movie if it didn t have some momentum killing moments There were times where I had to tell myself that it s just a movie so go with it and that s where the movie lost me Any time I have to tell myself it s just a movie is when I start to dislike movies and sadly Gravity is one of those movies There is a limit to how much a movie should push a single situation or scenario and in my humble opinion Gravity breaks that limit a few times It s hard to get back into a movie once you start to question the reality presented to you Overall Gravity is a fun movie that will definitely get your heart going have you dodging space debris and clinching your seat Absolutely worth the watch even if it s just for the amazing visuals If you don t like to do too much thinking and are looking for a fun immersive movie Gravity will not disappoint,7
6 October 2013,best movie a must watch,Two astronauts floating in space how could that possibly be a concept for one of the most riveting films I have ever seen and be deserving of the adjectives mentioned in this review s title And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing don t look away can t look away films I ve seen for a long time There are some films good entertaining films that you just watch Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING Instead you are EXPERIENCING That s Gravity Apart from the astonishing beautiful and epic scale of the film with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film Both actors give solid convincing performances but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent Her character has real depth and by some truly brilliant directorial techniques you become completely empathic with her Finally one hopes she may get that Best Actress Oscar that s missing from her award cabinet and when a space film gets the seal of authenticity from ISS astronauts and NASA it can t be THAT bad,10

20 June 2021,Absolutely boring movie,It was a struggle to get through this movie and I love space movies But this was just wow Would never watch again,1
10 October 2013,10/10 honestly.,I wanted to see this movie because the promo posters somehow reminded me of 2001 A Space Odyssey by Kubrick which is my favorite director but I was kinda convinced it would be similar to Apollo 18 in terms of substantial quality I was absolutely sucker punched in the face It is definitely the best looking special effects film in history The details the physics everything just makes sense it keeps you watching and interested It s a 1 1 2 hour long film and it feels like 2 hours One thing I do recommend watch it in 3D I ve never liked 3D films but I knew I had to this time to really enjoy the special effects,10

4 October 2013,Promising but way too cheesy in the end,I went to see Gravity this evening in the cinema and came out with mixed feelings I don t want to give anything away so let s say Gravity is pretty much Open Water in space While the CGI is very impressive the set itself is kind of minimalistic The build up of tension is also very well made and the film has you on the edge of your seat more than once That s probably where everybody just seeking a thrill can drop out the movie definitely delivers What really bothers me is the melodramatic undertone of the whole thing It starts with the sound effects during collisions in space Why bother mentioning that there is no sound in space at the beginning of the film when you don t let the pictures of destruction run in absolute and horrifying silence afterward but use all the methods of dramatization like synthi horns etc instead For me it takes away a large portion of atmosphere against the background of this very special setting Music is generally a big problem of this movie There is music that is a vital part of the scenery in a film e g The Sining and there is music that is nothing but a suggestive instrument to arouse emotion e g any given patriotic action movie Unfortunately Gravity uses the latter and thereby loads the otherwise cold and deadly solitude of space up with a feel this feel that music that doesn t fit at all The score makes this film really laughable at times and I have to say that Open Water made many things a lot better simply by sticking to the horror such a situation bears itself Concentrating on the deadly silence of space would have made this film great but it really falls victim to the overly dramatic use of music Judge for yourself,6
6 October 2013,Visually spetacular,This is a visually spectacular space adventure The dialogue and acting leave something to be desired at times but seeing it in theaters was a highly memorable experience It also did have a relatable emotional component,7
30 July 2020,The beginning of the movie is absolutely fantastic.,Brilliant The first act is one of the best The shot is so nice I missed watching a movie that is this good Im not a huge fan of scifi or space movies but this one stole my heart It s a good one Watch it,10

27 May 2018,Absolutly Remarkable!,These are such effects and space landscapes that are incredibly emotional in the man s sense of harmony and thinking Even if I add the very emotion that the film possesses I come to the conclusion that Gravity is an absolute 3D Masterpiece,10
13 March 2014,Overwhelmed by Unending Background Music,Movie plot line seemed interesting but after enduring 30 minutes of background music that washed over all other sounds and conversations I stopped watching Don t know if my rental was messed up or if this was the directors intention but it made the movie unbearable to watch Guess I need to have ten lines of text to submit a review My opinion does not take ten lines to express This movie may be more enjoyable to watch with the volume turned down and close captioning turned on Probably will finish watching it in this manner Very disappointed that I paid to rent this movie But I will update my review after I watch and read my way through the movie,1
18 February 2023,CGI over Reality,Huge amounts of CGI and loads of dramatic noise Very little acting or dialogue and a completely unrealistic story line Some scenes would probably have been more at home in a Brian Cox documentary about space It really doesn t grip although one or 2 scenes do hold the attention for a few seconds and there are a few moments of genuine emotion However this is no great Sci fi epic In reality it s a rather boring vehicle for a couple of big names to have some fun and make oddles of cash Yes the scenes in space look dramatic with lots of whirling around and dodging assorted debris but they re also utterly unrealistic No doubt many will have been captivated by it all but I prefer something with a bit more acting script dialogue and reality,3
13 October 2013,Entertaining,Even though my boyfriend convincingly explained some lacks in the storyline to me after we watched the movie I still thought it didn t take away too much of its entertainment value I gave Gravity a 10 since I thought it was the perfect mix of suspense and comedy This movie is perfect entertainment It is the opposite of long winded my boyfriend and I looked at each other one scene and when we looked back to the screen the protagonists were already in a different place Sandra Bullock played her role very authentically and added the drama to the story while George Clooney added the humor Even though the movie was very suspenseful and the characters were in a desperate situation there were still a few moments I had to laugh The 3D effects were great also,10
12 October 2013,THE Movie Of The Year,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
1 March 2014,GRAVITY - Castaway in space,The technicality is terrific A visual treat from space with a sound department deserving an Oscar Awesome cinematography that could take viewing to a new level with absolutely no cuts Nice direction with just two lead characters throughout the entire film Seriously was shocked to be listed among the top Oscar nominees and could possibly bag many It was because the movie story was a direct lift from Castaway except for the fact that the protagonist is lost in space instead of an island A very shallow script that no one could possibly discuss after viewing Also the movie has too many sci errors like the oxygen levels in a suite see it you ll understand Pros Special Effects sound Camera work Cons Predictable after the first 20 minutes clich s and errors hollow script,7
3 June 2015,Impossible to recommend enough!,Gravity is well known as an multiple Oscar winner thanks to the big praise from film critics When I plan on watching this movie I have low expectations because some people find it kinda nauseating because of the non stop spinning of the astronauts But after watching Gravity I have to speak for all of us when I say it s an absolute out of this world masterpiece We have Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who play as astronauts who are stranded in space after their space shuttle got destroyed I fell in love with the performance especially Bullock s Bullock s performance is one the main reasons why I love this film to bits You know the other reasons I ll tell you it s the amazing 3D visuals The Earth is visually astonishing as for the rest of it they re great The pace is really acceptable running over 90 minutes is much of appreciation for a film I would leave the direction the script and the music as honorable mentions Gravity is solid phenomenon and I will never recommend it enough I m glad that this won multiple Oscars and proclaimed as one the best movies of this decade To conclude Gravity is the best movie I ve seen in a long time Film Score 10 10 Masterpiece,10

16 October 2013,Intense atmosphere,This is one of the best movies of this year 2013 I think that Cuaron has to be nominated to the Oscars at least In this movie Cuaron take to the guest and bring in to the whole space You feel like you are there alone in the dark Sandra Bullock is not of the better actresses but she gets to share his lone less I recommend this movie if you are prepare to don t see guns punches sex and all Michael Bay s ingredients Go to the cinema or Imax George Cloney make a good character but he is on his own I mean he shows how to act being on your back garden The sounds music and sounds effect are terrify You can feel the lack of air in some moments,9
6 October 2013,Every Type Of Emotion will be Felt,This movie was excellent There is a lot I could say about this movie but I ll keep this short and simple You will feel scared at parts which will make some people cover their eyes You will feel edgy and feel the action in the movie to a point where you will be literally on the edge of your seat You will feel sad sorrow and might even cry like my date did Finally you will feel compassion and love for the characters and what they go through This isn t just another movie about space and disaster This is a story about escape fear love and romance and compassion PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE,10

17 November 2013,"Fear, hope and an unseen serene pleasure",Being a fan of Colony and Cuaron i was hoping for Gravity and after watching it i must say it leaves you in enlightened space of fear hope and an unseen serene pleasure Being commoners we have no idea of what it s like to be in space Every one of us dreams about it But the movie shows us the hardships and horrors of being alone along with the value of gravity I watched the movie in 3D and it gives a whole new perspective to viewer Top marks for wonderful editing Now the acting movie belongs to Bullock and she gives a powerful performance again after the blind side Range of her expressions through different phases like fear of being dead with no one praying in eyes and in the end the happiness of being found home after all the whole series of horrifying event leaves you with only one word great acting,9
5 October 2013,Space Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,It has been a while since I ve seen any film this good To all who may know me I don t hold back my complaints about movies very often But I truly have nothing to complain about here Everything was done exceptionally well The camera movement is enthralling the visuals are immersive the acting is excellent and the story itself is very impressive Cuar n anticipates exactly what the viewer expects and what the viewer fears to an astounding degree Every tense moment is made doubly tense for the audience who knows just knows that something else will happen even more jaw dropping than the last event I won t spoil anything here but the progression of the story is so compelling that I hardly ever took my full attention off what was happening An incredible effort an absurdly impressive payoff Give it all the awards,10

7 December 2020,Puristic sci-fi cinema of a different kind,Positive celebration of modern digital effects and inspiring images thrilling experience Negative the emotional ambition is too obvious weak script that works more through images than through exciting narration and also misses any type of message or drive Sandra Bullock is not a very authentic sci fi heroine,5

11 November 2013,"Beautiful, intense and so very simple",I like simple ideas and even more so if the results are as simple in it s execution But to get a truly well done minimalistic result a lot of work goes in to it Sometimes even more than on more complex projects Gravity is simple Very simple really Sure there is a storyline But there are no twists no surprising external influences on the course of the story There is a very limited amount of actors and elements we need to relate to And there is no protagonist It is as close as you get to a real life drama But in it s simplicity it is also extraordinary beautiful And here it is clear the effort to make it simple is truly complex and monumental Cuaron is a man known for long shots swooping camera movements toying with effects point of view and other visuals And it feels like this is what it all leads to It is perhaps the most beautiful film I have seen in the cinema It is crisp and truly awesome images we see Even when everything is chaos and hopelessness sets in the images are beautiful and scary The effect are just breathtaking My favourite scene involves an astronaut seemingly disappearing into darkness set against the Milky Way as a background It is such a powerful images and full of so darkness and light and infinite space It is a scary and yet awesome Clooney is great Ed Harris is comforting and Sandra Bullock is at her best And that is all there need to be said about the cast That is all there can be said The 3rd act does turn into Hollywood film territory as the fight for survival comes to an end And the turning point is quite clear to me in retrospect But even during this Cuaron makes the film beautiful and suspenseful Even if we know the outcome Almost at the very end the whole cinema literally gasped Cuaron has made a breathtaking film using his usual tricks and his sense of visuals I think this is the film of the year so far Nothing has come close to the impact this film has had For me and clearly for a lot of other people And watch it in 3D It really works,9
17 November 2013,A unique cinematic sensory experience,I saw it in 3D on Friday couple of days ago with a mate I wasn t expecting much but I was convinced by my friend that he had been told that the 3D was very good and worth the over 12 we paid for the ticked quite pricey in my opinion so I didn t go with any further expectations I don t think he went with any expectations either and a few minutes into the movie our jaws dropped and remained like that for most of the remaining of the movie Gravity is an incredible cinematic experience and deserves the good marks that it is receiving I would avoid the opinion of those miserable pedantic internet wise little people talking about script plot etc Seriously It doesn t try to wow you with epic phrases or a plot involving anything other than potentially real situations in space and strong and specific characters it does wow you by traveling with you in the skin of the main character making you feel what she feels It also wows you with stunning realistic and memorable scenes and some symbolism to take its meaning a bit further I absolutely recommend it I have tried to keep this review short with no spoilers at all so that you visit the cinema with no expectations like I did Enjoy it for what it is a cinematic sensory experience that will be with you long after you leave the cinema,10
3 July 2023,This movie is AWFUL !,The ONLY good thing about this movie is the pretty visuals of space tech etc EVERYTHING else about this movie is just incredibly bad Sandra is amazingly annoying especially when she freaks out after things start to go wrong and she turns into a useless hysterical little girl She is fantastically unlikeable and I didn t care at all if she lived or died And you won t be surprised that I TRIED watching this piece of junk 3 times previously and each time I turned it off The only reason I stuck it out to watch it to the end this time is I was bored and wanted to see what happened What a waste of time Don t make the mistake I did,2
30 October 2013,Slow and not enough action,Just watched Gravity and can t say it wasn t that great The movie was slow and personally I don t even know how they managed to make this more then an hour long For the duration they are just floating in space talking and not doing much Nothing really interesting in this movie beside a couple of twists in the shuttle I would have expected more from a high budget movie but what you see is really what you get and nothing more Maybe if they threw a little more action and a little bit more of that scifi action thriller and on the edge of your seat climax in there it could have turned out a little more interesting This movie gets a low rating from me,2
7 April 2014,Clooney does Brando!,very very very lazy movie 10 word storyline no imagination no acting no attempt to build character steals sound bites and snapshots with abandon from many other space sci fi movies not as homage but because they couldn t think of anything original or different to the same old stuff a cut and paste of 50 years of space without any context minimal it is but minimalist it is not the pretence of reality totally dispels any illusion of sci fi or reality there is sadly nothing positive here and yet another Hollywood computer cranked big budget flop in all respects save box office it seems to me the intent by the producers is to prepare audiences for even worse to come if you lose the odd bit of swearing in the first 15 minutes or so it plays OK for the under 9s but even for this age group there are so many more films that inspire imagination and wonder Oscars more like Emperor s new clothes,2
20 October 2013,"Great use of 3D, but... not so great screenplay :/",Well if you see a movie that only a few days after it s release go into Top 250 and is universal acclaimed in Metascore 96 100 the first thing you think is this is going to be a masterpiece I went today with a lot of expectations for this film but pff sometimes it was boring Only the character of Clooney makes you laughs sometimes but when he isn t anymore everything it s not great I must say the acting was really great The only problem was the screenplay it was pure and boooring I don t think this is the best space movie or the best movie of 2013 Sometimes I just could t wait to end Anyway I must say The use of 3D was the only great thing It was really awesome because all the movie is in space and it was a great experience So if you gonna watch this movie see it in 3D 2D will be more boring than it is 7 10 only for the 3D,7

14 July 2021,life-affirming,Yes it looks amazing but what really sets this apart is the sense of hope and meaning Sci Fis are usually so hard nosed Ripley has nothing to live for except her cat even in 2001 Space Odyssey hope is something we receive as a gift from outer space But Sandra Bullock is not just surviving to fight again another day and in fact she realises that even if she doesn t it doesn t matter so much She s trying to be worthy of her loved ones and of life itself Tense moving and life affirming as well as beautiful I think this is one of the best films of the last 10 years,9

8 October 2013,"great visual effect, hope have sequel.",visual effect and surround effect really nice on this movie worth to watch in cinema when the movie end i have the feeling y end so fast recommend watch this movie on over 20 feet screen if i watch this movie on a 60 TV i may just give it 6 10 George Clooney appear not much time in this movie more like a supporting actor then main actor even waste his handsome face most scene he is in helmet actually based on all the movie i watched before about Sandra Bullock her acting style act same similar on all the movie but if u ask me any other big female movie star can act the same role in gravity and better then Sandra bullock i would say not sure may be she already the best choice or may be Angelina jolia or may be Jessica Lawrence can handle the role better i hope this movie will have sequel if have sequel i think i will watch in imax 3d,7
3 August 2015,Subtle fantasy,Acknowledging the factual flaws choosing to ignore them makes the movie very enjoyable It doesn t need to be scientifically accurate to be a great film Don t let the seemingly vague dialogue fool you This was one relatable movie with it s subtle and very real dialogue instead of the recent deep Hollywood movies The panic and broken spirit is well portrayed in my eyes explaining how easy it is to forget any training being inexperienced Bullock does a great job throughout the film as does her counterpart Clooney portraying the relentless veteran trying to keep up her spirits just as much as his own Depicting a catastrophe the movie is packed with action but at points the viewer feels the Murphy s law weigh heavy on the plot a bit too heavy However all the things that can go wrong do so in a stunning manner and it s a delight as well it s very captivating to watch Beautiful to behold simple in means of delivering emotion it s a gripping piece that leaves you terrified in awe and full of fighting spirit,8

4 October 2013,Gravity is Powerful Visually and Psychologically,Having now seen the movie I can say my assumptions were correct the marketing of the movie was very poor In fact I got much better insight to what to expect from Jon Stewart s gushing interview with Sandra Bullock on the Daily Show He wasn t exaggerating Gravity is visually stunning and exciting Think 2001 but at the pace of say Die Hard or Aliens But this is not a sci fi movie This is a character study and a psychological mind trip Two hours with only two characters on screen You get to know them intimately The masterwork aspect of the movie is that you don t get bored Gravity is also not an art for art s sake movie While it is built from the ground up to fully exploit 3 D the strength of the movie is the characters and the fact that you are sucked in and deeply invested in them particularly Bullock I know I tend to overuse analogies so I apologize But the idea that came to my mind to set my fellow movie go er s expectations was imagine Vince Gilligan directing Castaway in space with the pacing of Need for Speed The intensity and tension of a Breaking Bad episode applied to a different genre Go see it In 3 D See if you don t agree Leave the little ones home though There is a little too much scary intense bad stuff happening,10
29 August 2014,Naked Fear,Air Breath Oxygen How much of it do we take for granted Cold Dark Alone How many of us have really experienced it Space Void Black Fear How many of us can really comprehend it To be in space is at once beautiful thrilling and terrifying Like a sailor adrift in an ocean on a dark night Earth shines like a beacon near and yet so far Always just out of reach Out there everything is put into perspective and you realize your insignificance in front of it all Alfonso Cuaron gives you an experience that few can match It gives you an astronaut s view and shows you the enormity of nothingness Sounds antithetical doesn t it But that s exactly how it is From here from the security of land of Earth we gaze up at the stars and wonder about aliens and exotic planets And sometimes the black nothingness that lies in between encroaches our vision and thoughts This film does not preach and like Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey and Tarkovsky s Solaris this film shows in a very unique way the meaning of life and of survival Out there there is everything and there is nothing There is just you Facing it is the ultimate test Watching this film made me realize how much of our planet we take for granted We seldom think that gravity is the anchor that keeps us home The subtle meaning and choice of words are integral themes in the film that of a mother who has lost her daughter who has lost her hope her anchoring or to put it bluntly her gravity She is drifting literally and mentally But she finds that courage to cling on and return In this film you come face to face with the sheer horror of space of the impenetrable intangible all encompassing never ending darkness How you intend to face it alone is up to you,10
31 October 2013,The absolute worst movie ever.,We saw Gravity IMax 3D expecting to be awed an amazed Great actors story line I was ready to walk out so many times out of pure yawning The acting was flat George played his usual self George being the overconfident man child who thinks he s the best of the best Ms Bullock made her character to be weak and indistinct The story was predictable full of technical errors and the ending what can I say d uh Yes the graphics were good but not anything totally new or amazing If you want to sit and listen to heavy breathing grunting you ll love it Honestly we sat there laughing at how ridiculous it all was All for 20 thanks for nothing Not that I m knocking television but there are TV shows more deserving of Oscar talk than this loser,1

16 February 2020,Amazing cinematography,First off don t watch this for the plot it s ridiculous Get passed that and accept this as a movie not an accurate portrayal of space travel and it s highly enjoyable I am very demanding in what I require for space films especially if they sell themselves as possible or realistic Having said this I went into Gravity with an open mind and despite the numerous and many inaccuracies I really enjoyed it It s a roller coaster ride with outstanding visuals and a nice touching element of humanity A fine example of when the content does not have to be too strong when all the elements around it to piece it together are so visually and audibly stunning As a gamer it is often said good graphics do not make a good game this movie proves that statement does not apply to cinema,8
3 May 2014,Boring and totally not a drama at least for me :/,This is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen Why i wanted to watch it because i saw a countdown on youtube and it was in a good spot i think 2 or 1 Then i went to watch it and i was sooo bored Also it says that this film is a Drama and a Thriller but i didn t really see a time of you know make me feel something You know that feeling when you are ready to cry in a drama and the tears are ready to fall off Well that didn t happen The Only part i was happy it was the end I don t recommend that movie unless you want to be bored Also it would be better if Sandra Bullock was more realistic I didn t say that she was bad instead she was very good but in some parts i felt like she didn t give us the right responds,2

5 October 2013,"Great special effects and acting, but unbelievable story",The special effects are very good and you wonder how they shot those space scenes simulating weightlessness So to appreciate all the cinematography it is worthwhile to watch in 3D But just two actors no matter how good and talented left something to be desired Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney act very well but at times the story and the litany of crises seemed too long And paradoxically some of the ways those problems were overcome by the characters was not realistic The plot was too unbelievable and the basic story line was weak Too many dramatic coincidences and narrow escapes Too many lucky breaks So if you re looking for great acting and intriguing details of experiences and time spent in space you ll find this movie worthwhile We didn t find it as entertaining as we expected,6

23 November 2013,"ridiculous screenplay, storyline and plot",Okay according to the film at the very beginning AT 372 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND NO AIR PRESSURE so the whole movie basically should be like this except the radio communication between the astronauts and the houston mission control center on earth and the radio communication between and among those astronauts there should be NO SOUND absolutely NO SOUND in this movie but ridiculously the movie is full of sound track special sound effects suspenseful background music from the very beginning to the end this movie use the help of the specially made music sound track to make the whole movie SOUNDS like suspenseful then the medical engineer played by sandra block at the very beginning of the film working outside of the space shuttle as a mechanical engineer trying so hard to put screws on some obscure device a medical engineer should do lot of tests in the space shuttle s cabin but instead she worked like a mechanic in the space to fix some whatever device but obviously not a medical device then while she as a medical engineer doing the works as a mechanical engineer we saw two other astronauts foolishly playing tumbling somersaults in the space with their jet space suits this is absolutely ridiculous the whole space shuttle and most of the crew were shattered and killed and the medical engineer was thrown out to the space lost her control and kept tumbling in the void there s no way that she could stop such tumblings and there s no way the other survivor could catch her up even he got jet engine and all of these scenes should be in a silent mode except her screams in her helmet two astronauts flied and floated to the remote international space station givemeabreak will you and since the iss is Russian made so all the manuals were in Russian language and the American medical engineer happened to know where the manuals were and which one was the one she needed to operate the module and which page to refer to yeah right then after so intensified sound effect to portray the atrocity and the tough survival journey of the medical engineer she finally reached another space station constructed by the Chinese and again the American medical engineer got no problem to operate it in order to show how the Chinese did a lousy job on their landing pod once the American medical engineer landed into the ocean and opened the cap the sea water was rush into the ridiculously capsized pod yet just before she opened it we clearly saw that the opening was above the water line but never mind the Chinese landing pod got to sink to the sea bottom and then she spent so long to get to the surface but soon as she popped out of the surface there were shallow water sea weeds around her and she just did some strokes and easily reached the beach how convenient don t you think the whole movie has used the miraculous convenience after miraculous convenience for the sole miraculous survivor scenario and plot and the deafening shattering sound effect to fool the audience through and through no wonder even the Christian newspapers were bought into it and claimed that this sci fi movie further proved that GOD INDEED IS EVERYWHERE but don t see that God had caused such disasters one after another and only allow the CHOSEN ONE to survive for the American medical engineer the last space station made in china was obvious the NOAH s Ark not in Egypt but in Space I rest my case,
28 February 2014,No Atmosphere,If this is academy award stuff we re in big trouble It s better left to those Imax guys at least they don t have to worry themselves about character development There you are hurtling through space seconds away from death attached by a fragile cord and you say is there a Mister Stone give me a brucking fake Nobody has the right to be called Kowalski in a movie except Clint Eastwood he s the only one who can carry off a name like that In my world which is firmly rooted here on Earth there wouldn t be a chance of this movie making it out of the production lab But it seems that in the world of Hollywood nobody in quality control looks at the final product I know movies are supposed to stretch your credibility but this one stretched you to snapping point It should have been classified as a still birth d o a or whatever description they have for life s disappointments If you still insist on going to see it amuse yourself by trying to figure out what vast swaths of land and sea the ship is travelling over There ll be little else of interest to hold your attention,2
6 October 2013,Fantastic,James Cameron was correct when he said Gravity is the best space film ever made with a close second for 2001 A Space Odyssey The special effects are magnificent and seamless the cinematography and choreography are breathtaking and the thematic elements are not reduced by the simple concept of the story This film is beautiful to watch If you watch it for nothing else just enjoy the enthralling scenes of debris tearing through shuttles and space stations or the amazing shots of Earth from space Cuar n s signature long cuts contribute to the palpable tension and realism of the movie The special effects are astounding The zero gravity environment is completely believable and precisely created It is astounding to think that this film could not be made so seamlessly without actually filming in Earth orbit Sandra Bullock is excellent and though George Clooney s role is relatively minor Clooney is also great Some of Gravity s criticism has been toward the supposed weak characterization and synthetic banter between the two characters but this was not evident to me and is really a footnote on a nearly flawless film The story is somewhat weak and simple but completely original and mostly accurate The only inaccuracy is the proximity of space stations and debris orbits but again this is a minor detail Cuar n makes the most of this story with some beautiful and simple messages We march toward death as surely as gravity draws falling objects toward Earth But it s one hell of a ride If you haven t seen Gravity watch it as soon as you can,9
7 October 2013,It pulls you,I got hooked by this movie since I saw the trailer of it and the actual movie exceeded my expectation Gravity is a survival themed movie and different from the rest of its predecessors or at least those I have seen there is nothing in this movie that really seems threatening Unlike in a natural disaster movie where you can see the earth moves and bends trying to swallow the main character or vicious animals that lurks in the dark and jumps out to eat people This movie offers none of that but you can feel the tension the anxiety and the rush of Doctor Ryan Stone played by the still mesmerizing Sandra Bullock trying to survive in space 90 of the movie takes place in outer space with no sound and little light which is superb since it s true to the fact that you can t hear anything with no oxygen Stunning camera works and visual effects Almost Final Fantasy ish in animation but better than Avatar The acting is marvelous just how you would expect from Bullock and Clooney who is once again retains the role of a no care in the world tough guy But the spotlight is indeed on Bullock It must be hard to act on a movie where the entire thing revolves on your acting because this movie has no one except her to do all the acting The story is well there is no story It just about how space is a person who got lost in it and trying to get home It could be a little boring for some because the movie is slow paced and centers around in the psychological state of the characters and the depiction of live in space instead of all the actions But if you like simple movies that digs deep into the characters mind then you surely will enjoy this All in all this movie is fantastic Watch it in 3D if you have the chance because i didn t and it should be better in it A 9 10,9
16 November 2013,A great pain to watch it,I am a great fun of 3D movies and computer graphics and I was looking forward to see this movie After 15min I was already quite disappointed to realize that the 3D depth is nothing special when you have the black flat background of the space as in this movie I did not like at all the part of the movie where the camera was turning around forever with the clear intention to make people sick They manage it perfectly and I could only close my eyes for 5min Unfortunately i could not close my ears and stop the never ending loop of fake breathing sounds The rest of the movie is obvious the story if there is one is incredibly unrealistic while pretending to be realistic The acting is amazingly boring and fake looking If you fell asleep in the middle and you wake up 10min before the end you do not lose anything At one point i just wanted the movie to finish Someone should tell to the director that in space there is no wind and no gravity that pull people away they should or jump back or go straight I strongly disagree with all the good reviews In summary low 3D perception high probability to feel sick bad acting bad and redundant storyline no logic in what happens physics laws not respected,1

14 January 2014,Great Cinematic Venture,Gravity 3D First Day and First Show Indeed one of the finest science fiction films till date which has a canvas like Steven Spielberg and a story structure whose first half has the shades of Stanley Kubrick s 2001 Space Odyssey and the second half has the shades of Ang Lee s Life of Pi with an over melodramatic touch in between and flaw in the editing that could have been crisper The film score full marks with it s brilliant cinematography by Emannuel Lubezki production design work by Andy Nicholson visual effects work by Tim Webber and his team of Framestore and Richard Baker and music score by Steven Price George Clooney and Sandra Bullock do great justice to their roles and add life to the film Overall director Alfonso Cuaron succeeds in delivering a great yet not excellent film worth watching only on 3D for a great life experience My rating would be 4 5,8
31 October 2013,Makes you feel like you're in space,I am watching an amazing 3D film after really long with effects that really give you the feel of being in outer space It really is an experience to watch Gravity A group of astronauts researching in space are hit by debris from a destroyed satellite killing most of them except two and the two have to survive and make it to earth with limited resources floating all alone in space Unique concept great effects and a perfect score well acted especially by both protagonists make this film a worth watch but of course only on big screen It s short and fast paced and keeps you hooked to the edge of your seat,10
28 February 2014,Worst,Worst movie I have ever seen Although the visual graphics were nice the movie lacked anything to grab the viewers and the ending was the most lackluster ending I ve ever seen I could have written a better script Shame on Sandra Bullock and George Clooney for stealing viewers money Given the status of both actors they should have known it was garbage and not made it Anything for money I guess This movie went on and on and in the end left the viewers wanting something anything Gosh I have to write at least 10 lines I can t even think of anything worth saying in regards to this movie that could fill 10 lines This movie was a waste of money and I wish I could have my 91 minutes back,1
17 February 2014,Out of this world good! Don't believe the haters.,I just want to start by saying that Gravity is definitely one of my all time top favorite movies It s just plain fantastic It s extremely focused in the story it sets out to tell That means that from the second the film opens until the end you re in space and you re experiencing everything that Dr Ryan Stone is experiencing It s thrilling it s emotional and it really is one hell of a ride Having such a strong focus proves that you don t need a huge cast and you can rely on amazing actors and directors to create a highly artful and enjoyable experience In this film that lack of other actors on screen really helped perpetuate that feeling of isolation and helplessness way out in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney did an amazing job here The realness that was expressed just made me feel like I was there in her shoes I rooted for her every step of the way even when everything seemed to be going wrong and things looked hopeless I had never heard of director Alfonso Cuar n before but wow his vision for this movie was absolutely realized Overall I hope people don t get bogged down by the haters and give it a chance themselves I don t really understand why people would say this movie is boring I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my heart was pounding several times I say ignore the haters and give it a watch,10
28 October 2013,Very disappointed.,Hello My name is Andrew Let me first say that I saw this movie expecting action suspense and a good story line But to get to the guts I was very disappointed There was no action per say because the action is comprised of space stations blowing up And that s it The first is not very well explained even why it blew up no it is not aliens its some weird meteor shower or something The suspense was non existent as the movie is completely watching a woman floating in space There is nothing suspenseful about it because it looks like she s just floating in water And the story was a total flop As I stated already the movie is completely watching a woman floating in space and occasionally seeing a space station blow up and there s the story I have heard this movie was made to showcase special effects But what I saw could have been put into a 3 minute video much easier for a much lower budget than 100 000 000 All around I do not recommend this movie for someone looking for something worth watching If you want to blow some money and have time to waste check it out But it is the worst movie I have seen since I used to watch black and white cowboy films when I was 6 17 years ago Have a great day,1

11 July 2021,Heinnn? What was that?,It s just a simple storyline with very short runtime I can not comment on anything but I ll say I m bit disappointed with it It was a SciFi movie so I had a better expectations from it Anyway If you wanna timepass for 90min with a SciFi Space Astronaut genre movie then without keeping any expectations go for it and yeah you can watch it with your family as well Overall 4 out of 10 Stars from my side,4
22 March 2015,Waste of time!,After buying a 3d 4k TV I wanted to see something that showcased the technology Unfortunately this was not it The 3D effects were OK but the rest was dismal If you have a basic understanding of science you ll be appalled watching this movie I stopped enjoying it about 10 minutes in and stopped watching about 30 minutes in This movie was a total waste of money I gave it 3 stars for the special effects which were completely unrealistic but fun to see The plot and the acting were some of the worst I have ever seen I cannot believe it won any awards or that there are reviews any better than 3 stars which I thought was VERY generous,3
23 November 2013,"Original, Incredibly Immersive, And Totally Unpredictable.",I ll start with saying I think this film is underrated I think most people read the good reviews and try not to enjoy it the films designed to be immersive and if you somehow try to avoid it you re not going to enjoy it Complaining about bad physics is really pathetic with cinematography I went to the film not knowing what to expect I d only heard the word amazing I didn t know the plot I didn t even know it was set in space don t let anyone spoil this film to you as you probably won t enjoy it as much as I did The film is incredibly unique many of the films I ve seen lately consist of medieval sword fighting it s the same thing each time This film puts itself in a whole new category The film changes camera angle about five times the whole thing is pretty much done in one take It is completely unexpected It s hard to make a guess on what s going to happen next it s not at all linear and the whole time you think the lead part is toast The film has one big flaw or the game has one shall I say It felt like I was playing Battlefield whilst watching Is Sandra Bullock even in this film Oh she is but only her voice it seems It s still incredibly advanced SFX wise but it sometimes ruins the immersion and reminds you that what you re watching isn t reality your jaw undrops on the close ups There was also one quite cringy scene which I felt could ve been done slightly differently which you ll spot when you watch this film It gets a 9 for being original immersive and unpredictable But the amazing animation sometimes wasn t convincing enough,9
15 August 2023,I have a bad feeling about this mission.,Sandra Bullock plays Ryan Stone a brilliant medical engineer on her first mission in space She s working alongside veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney a confident type not prone to panicking But a routine task goes extremely awry when wreckage from an exploded Russian satellite destroys their shuttle and strands Ryan Matt in outer space He manages to tether the two of them together while they try to make it to the International Space Station which is not that far away Directed co produced co edited and co written with his son Jonas by accomplished filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron this becomes both an impressive visual achievement and a poignant journey for its main character While I did have some issues with the script Cuaron makes this an interesting journey to take complete with incredible production design by Andy Nicholson cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and visual effects Cuaron is able to do an immersive approximation of what it s really like to be floating in the bleak vastness of space even when there are always landmarks in sight Mostly this is worth watching for Bullock While Clooney is engaging it s interesting that his character is prone to telling stories when this is really HER story Bullock required to do some very physical and emotional things struggles mightily to keep calm under this unimaginable pressure She s touched when given reminders of life back on Earth the sounds of dogs barking and a baby crying She s also a relatable and believable individual somewhat in over her head she s got her work cut out for her avoiding panicky behavior A few years in the making this won many awards including Oscars for Cuaron co editor Mark Sanger Lubezki composer Steven Price whose score is truly striking and for the sound mixing sound editing and visual effects It s definitely a memorable experience Ed Harris who of course had previously done Apollo 13 is the voice of Mission Control Seven out of 10,7
17 March 2014,Space-Drama without Realism,5 stars because i have seen far worse movies than this one and it somehow entertained me The best idea i have heard so far is that all that happens after the Spaceshuttle is hit by debris the first time is just the hallucination of Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock Well this is not what the author intended but it makes the movie by far better Gravity starts of very good with realistic Space scenes and wonderful pictures but when the crew and Spacecraft are hit by debris every realism goes away It gets so weird i had to say to myself forget realism enjoy the pictures but it didn t work out all the time There are simply too many scenes where a SciFi Fan Which i consider myself simply has more than enough knowledge about space vacuum and the laws of physics to make the head shake like a nodding dog on a gravel road Bullock does a decent job to sell you the story I really wonder how some people compliment Gravity for Realism Still it is a good popcorn movie and for those people who don t care about realism a really fantastic one You think Armageddon or Space Cowboys was as realistic as Apolle 13 Great this is your movie If not be warned Gravity wants to but doesn t obey the laws of physics,5

10 April 2014,Very disappointed,I was looking forward to watching this on my 3d TV with the family Sadly the film did not hold our attention The special effects were good but the story was boring The ending became a bit silly Given the great reviews I was expecting something special Most great movies can be watched more than once George Clooney and Sandra Bullock certainly must have worked their socks off in the acting department and generally they are associated with watchable films The beginning started off well and the special effects of the debris storm was fine and the 3d screen showed the films best bits at this point After that it went downhill and the family lost interest We stuck with it till the end This film is poor,5
11 April 2014,Please let her die..!!!,Short and sweet Worst acting ever by a female in a major motion picture Never have i wanted someone not to survive in a movie of this type take yourself back to Castaway of course we wanted Tom Hanks to survive and hell we even cried when Wilson was swept out to sea and he was a volley ball who by the way had more screen presence and acting ability then Sandra Bullock We all wanted Sigourney Weaver to survive through at least 3 Alien films by the fourth i was willing to see her dead Now don t get me wrong i have enjoyed some of Bullocks performances in the past but this crock of bullocks of a movie has destroyed my faith in Professional movie reviewers who for some reason more likely not getting the right invites decided that this was a masterpiece How the hell did she even get nominated for awards at all is beyond my comprehension and i can understand the technical awards for the CGI work but thats it George Clooney in this movie was not that much better thankfully his 10 min worth of acting saved us from more excruciating pain of poor dialogue and poor delivery I watched it at home on DVD hired by someone else Thank god i didn t fork out 50 to see this crap at the theatre or spent the extra dime on bluray Unless you have an IQ of zero gravity avoid at all cost,1

26 October 2013,A Film That Is Frightening And Gorgeous,Thrilling tense ambitious exciting beautiful and horrific These are the words that I mostly hear that is associated with this film and I can now safely say that it does live up to those words It s praise from critics and general audience is definitely understandable as this film is a powerhouse in direction cinematography musical score and visual effects The film is written by Jon s and Alfonso Cuar n Both have written a script that focuses much more on the survival of both Stone and Kowalsky which I think is a great approach and also can be risky in being discarded as another thriller that does not break any new ground Gravity does not feel campy as the story places these two characters in a situation that has the audience feeling tense and fearful of the unpredictability of space and the chance of not being able to breathe The film does also touch on philosophical themes that had me understand the value of life The film is directed by Alfonso Cuar n who is best known for his work on the third Harry Potter film and Children of Men Cuar n is definitely a great storyteller and knows how to keep both simple and deep audiences to be thoroughly entertained Cuar n doesn t seem to try to create something unique but rather create something that would evoke something from the audience Gravity s photography is handled by Emmanuel Lubezki who is mostly known for his work on Terrence Malick s recent films Gravity is simply a gorgeous film and definitely may be the prettiest film of the year The photography captures the darkness and emptiness of space and supports the tension and tone that Cuar n was going for Visual effects also plays a role in making the film look and feel realistic I watched the film in 3D which i rarely do but it definitely works in this film as debris come by the characters and sometimes come towards us and haves us looking away as it just feels so real and frightening I cannot decide whether Lubezki s best work is either the emptiness and lifeless picture of Gravity or the beautiful image of life and nature of The Tree of Life The film s score is handled by Steven Price who is a new composer as he has only really worked on three films Price has cerated a score that kept me felt tense without me knowing that it was Price s score that caused me to flinch or shocked me The last time a score that had my heart racing was Hans Zimmer s score on The Dark Knight Rises Gravity s score definitely doesn t stand out in comparison to other thriller action films in recent years but this doesn t retract from the score s effectiveness to get a reaction out of us The film s acting is driven by both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Bullock as Ryan Stone was great in showing the fear that one would feel when they are helpless in space Clooney as Matt Kowalski portrays the rational thinking that is required from a person when a crises occurs he is the voice in our head that we must try to listen to but sometimes is clouded by the anxiety and fear that we feel when a crises occurs Both actors play well with each other and something I deeply enjoyed while watching this film Gravity is a intense thriller that haves the audience feeling fearful and anxious of the dangers of space while at the same time delivering a good score and an incredibly gorgeous photography This is definitely a film that I would constantly come back to in the future as it s themes and approach resonates well with me,10
6 October 2022,"Deserved its 7 academy awards, well done!!!!!",What a gorgeous beautiful breathtaking unforgettable movie From the start the movie pulls you right into it and makes you feel glueed to the screen Everything about this breathtaking movie is perfection there is nothing at all wrong with this movie Academy award winner and the speed actress Sandra bullock most definitely deserved her oscar nomination for Best performance by an actress in a leading role here but she should of won though because it was basically a one woman show and Sandra did not dissapoint at all she was the heart and soul of this movie I love the gorgeous realistic visual effects in this movie,10
30 December 2014,Survival,Alfonso Cuaron directed this visually stunning film that stars Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone who is on her first outer space mission aboard the space shuttle Explorer along with veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalski played by George Clooney who get a massive shock when debris from a destroyed Russian missile causes a chain reaction in space sending more debris hurtling towards them as they are both away from the shuttle which is destroyed putting them in a fight for survival to get back to Earth before their oxygen wears out and more debris arrives Marvelous F X and direction really put the viewer in space like never before captured even if the story and characters don t reach the same heights of inspiration,7
27 October 2013,Visually stunning - but little else to talk about,Enjoyed the movie great to look at but there is so little to talk about afterwards You can only say wow that looked incredible so many times There is no character driven plot or development other than two rather obvious clich s Cynical astronaut who has been there done that Timid space newbie who has to wise up pronto to survive There is also plenty of cheese here In fact our journey home had us picking over the physics and continuity errors of which there are a few Never a good sign I think Acting wise Clooney has been a lot better than this and has been given the job of perking the thing up Bullock is OK but nothing out of the ordinary The picture will win possibly 4 Oscars but none of the big prizes Over rated at 8 something will find its place among the late 6s in time,7
14 October 2013,I Can't Even Explain...Just WOW,Well I just watched most intense movie EVER it was amazing mind boggling and extremely stressful in a good way When I went to see Gravity I was expecting to come back and be able to write a wordy review telling how it was just two people floating around in space talking about life while they die this was not the case What I saw is beyond words beyond anything I have ever seen This is the kind of movie that brings film back to the height of innovation it felt like seeing a movie for the first time The movie was 91 minutes but it felt like 20 It was spectacular jaw dropping suspenseful and the most starkly beautiful film I have seen in a long time It s hard to put what I saw into words so what I can recommend is just see it because it is going to go down in the history books Also see it in 3D 1000 worth it I m just going to go sit and think about it now and maybe have a warm cup of soothing tea and fall and kiss the earth because I can Watch the film,10
6 October 2013,The most boring movie I've ever seen in my all life,I watched this movie and many times during it I wanted to have a move fast button to play it What I mean is that this movie was so boring and very stupid 8 8 score this is unreal A v e r y b a d m o v i e Trust me don t waste your money on such ugly production Watch it online and don t go to the theaters Everything in this movie is unrealistic physics etc nothing was real I don know what people liked this movie Worst movie ever Your review does not contain enough lines the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text idiot website,1
18 August 2014,Nothing at all special.,Quite often a project has its worth enhanced by the names attached to it and that is exactly what happened with Gravity Having Clooney Bullock and Cuaron s names attached elevated a particularly average often borderline awful movie about an astronaut floating in space to a level it doesn t deserve to be at Then there s also the 3D aspect I purposely neglected to see this in 3D as a movie shouldn t need to be seen a certain way to be appreciated I DO appreciate that using a particular technique or say a big action flick being filmed for IMAX screens has benefits but it only makes the experience more fun or more engrossing it doesn t affect the movie in any other way than cosmetically So when I m told you have to see Gravity in 3D it s meant to be seen in 3D that s great but if you take away the 3D there should still be a great cinematic spectacle to experience Instead what you re left with is Sandy Bullock floating about in space for 70 minutes seemingly losing her grip on reality Maybe this was a cinematic gold for some people but for me it just left me feeling a little lost as to what all of the fuss and hype was about,4
10 November 2013,Brilliant Movie,Simply stunning Sandra Bullock in a career best role breathtaking action see it This film will suck you into the void of Space the camera moves with the action and you feel part of the action Grab a seat and enjoy The last time I saw a film this remarkable was Space Odyssey back in 1968 It s a story of survival against all the odds I found myself rooting for the characters from the beginning willing them on The camera work is innovative and the vistas of Earth are quite beautiful The action scenes are exciting It has been a long time since a film has left and indelible impression on me The whole film is beautifully choreographed,10

22 June 2021,Decent Movie,I disagree with some reviewers that say this film is slow I find the film moving at a good pace not fast not slow If I have any problem with this movie it would be the fact the story is rather bland I felt it was missing layers and depth Overall the film is a good watch it s not boring but it just doesn t have the depth I would expect from a modern sci fi film of this caliber 7 10,7
21 October 2013,A Must Watch,Gravity satisfies you you feel every moment The best 3D movie so far some scenes are amazing Best combination of creativity and technology Alfonso Cuaron is the man he did and intensive research on space Everything is perfect making this movie was a really a very tough task how can anyone imagine such scenes he spend 6 year on this project and now it ll be a case study in film making I given up my dream of becoming a NASA scientist after watching this movie this was the impact on me I felt everything even nausea in zero gravity scene i was literally feeling no gravity in scenes where object comes towards screen i really tried to save myself from those more then 3 times Sandra did a fantastic job without her acting this impact was impossible to create with only 2 character gravity bounds you till the end Cuaron made special instrument to shoot the film and all his hard work now been paid off Whole world is praising this master piece,9

3 July 2014,"Great effects, emetic script",3 10 that s 9 10 for visuals and 1 10 for script Whether this or that could really happen up there in orbit is for me beside the point Sit back suspend your disbelief and enjoy But as a British viewer I am yet again appalled at the mawkishness of the script in an American movie yes I should be used to it by now but it always shocks me Are Americans REALLY this sentimental I larve you Marmmee says cute dying 3 year old girl preferably Shirley Temple look alike and audience are instantly reaching for their hankies I can t believe it My American friends are not like this though that said I have never seen them in a cinema Suffice it to say that I stuck it out to the end for the visuals And S B wasn t at all bad given what she had been given to say But I would never want to see it again unless fully dosed up on anti emetics,3
21 December 2016,"Houston, I have a problem...",Before Gravity occupies the black screen with the same ominous effect than TV series title Lost you have this superposed text about the temperature and pressure in space making life impossible When I saw this my immediate reaction was duh really how about telling me something I don t know I don t mean to be sarcastic but it doesn t take a scientific degree to be aware that life in space is impossible that space couldn t carry sound and air So I was questioning the inclusion of this disclaimer Surely Cuaron trusts enough the intensity of his material not to need to amplify the menace that will pend over the heroine so why the thought challenging director of Children of Men would state the obvious Because he treats a very basic premise in the most basic way taking for granted that just because it is a story of survival we will relate to it It just works on a primal level and Sandra Bullock manages to elevate the material to the required emotional level I was touched by her struggles to get to Earth but the film didn t make me care for how good she was it wasn t a stranded performance in the same level than Tom Hanks in Cast Away but it s not Bullock s to blame but the wrong approach Indeed we understand it s a race around the clock so how about keeping this in subtext and try to enrich the film a little bit We have woman stranded alone in the most hostile place and deprived of the most basic aspect of humanity which is standing and walking yet still using the one human strength still able to work intelligence that was the heart of the film and it worked for the most part But let s not pretend that the triumph of intelligence is enough to make a whole film especially after Apollo 13 Ridley Scott s The Martian dealt with a similar situation but the film spanned a longer amount of time You can t make a journey when the run time is one hour and half but I guess it was the longest such a thin premise could be sustained one hour and half rightfully divided into three half an hours First she still benefits from the advice and company of wisecracking George Clooney half an hour of loneliness and half an hour of a climax and some existential and emotional undertones It works for the most part and again the performance of Sandra Bullock strikes the right emotional chord but there are many moments that can only feel as fillers and you know Gravity only shines through its first and third act but is rather unsatisfying in the middle I feel a bit guilty to criticize the story when there s so much to praise on the special effects but the effects are just vehicles for the story In Gravity you feel like the opposite is happening And when she gets home she s triumphant and we re happy for her but for some reason I expected that to happen and I wasn t as emotionally overwhelmed as I expected I didn t know what exactly was lacking in the film to be honest so I wondered whether it was one that could only benefit from a big screen viewing and there s would be no comparison with a TV or DVD experience I don t think a film can be so spectacular to lose its entertaining value on smaller screen and actually it s thanks to the very DVD of the film that I could pinpoint the problem or let s just say the wasted opportunity When I saw the bonus features and the documentary about the Kessler syndrome I was mesmerized and I enjoyed that half an hour more than the film itself That was something I didn t know I didn t know space has turned to a real junkyard ever since the conquest of the air by the irresponsibility of men and the risk of collision between satellites is increasing and might provoke damage of exponentially spectacular effects each collision creating debris increasing the likelihood of bigger collisions hence making in the short term all the satellite useless and God knows how satellites have became indispensable in our technology driven era Now that would have made one hell of a disclaimer because this is exactly what takes off the action and this is something that could scare us more than anything We relate to Stone as humans but we all directly relate to the satellite issue Even more why the hell did they choose as a cause like a Russian satellite destroyed how about a collision between satellites to emphasize the tragic randomness of these disasters Gravity should have raised this awareness not diminish its impact by choosing an accidental cause Now I don t know how the collision case could have been handled within Stone s misadventure but it could have worked nonetheless since space is such a crowded place Cuaron had a lot of material to work on but he picked the easy choice and seemed in a rush to conclude the film Maybe the effects were too big to maintain them for two hours but still it didn t give him time to work on some little flaws such as Clooney s performance or the timing of the oxygen level These moments felt so cinematic in a film that tries to border on realism and the one moment that felt realistic was the communication with that Eskimo father but then again it took me the DVD features to understand what was going on Would have showing the Eskimos ruined the premise of the film I respect the choice of Cuaron but in the end the story suffers a bit from a rushed directing And what stays in the film is the excellence of the special effects so the flaws of the story are no gravity case but the film isn t a masterpiece for all that,7
18 October 2013,The Only Stars To Shine Here Were In The Visual Effects,Okay for me Sandra Bollock and George Clooney do very very well in comedy or a lighter type movie Neither one is especially remarkable at drama For this one for me they simply were not believable The plot was predictable the dialogue lame I was vastly disappointed with the writing even with Bollock s soliloquy moments they just didn t ring true They weren t believable Nor was she I kept waiting to be swept away to be caught up in the whole drama but it never happened And I m the type of person who lives in the movies I see I become part of them Not this one Those of us who went to see this picture all came out with the same feeling The visual effects were stunning Fantastic That part was not only gripping but frighteningly realistic In fact I m sure there s an Oscar involved there But not for Bollock or Clooney In fact if they are even nominated for this one I m going to think something s radically wrong with the whole process Not that this is a bad movie it isn t Or that they were really bad They just weren t how to explain it They weren t enough They weren t sufficient for the idea the moment Just not as spectacular as I had expected or been led to believe However the feel and emotion of deep space incredible I know for sure I don t ever want to be there That part of this movie was something none of us will be forgetting any time soon,7

15 September 2022,One lingering question,George Clooney s character is a Lieutenant and presumably a US Naval Aviator There is no way a middle aged Navy Lieutenant would ever be a space shuttle mission commander By his age and position he d have a rank of Commander or Captain Most Space Shuttle mission commanders are currently serving military officers and at the top of their profession not a middle aged Navy Lieutenant that has been passed over for promotion Other than that question it is a very good science fiction survival story The CGI is amazing a compelling story and the action disaster seems are incredible Oh and can anybody figure out the land masses shown on the earth s surface,8
24 March 2015,Possibly the worst space based film ever,This is yet another example of an over hyped and a deeply underwhelming movie I couldn t get past the first 20 minutes but after forcing myself to watch it in full my opinion did not change The decent effects are the only saving grace of this shockingly awful film The actors are also lackluster Also did I mention how many inaccuracies are in the film regarding simple physics Don t waste time watching it I wish I hadn t,1
11 October 2013,Pass the Popcorn review,Judging by various internet rating sites Gravity is currently the best movie from 2013 And along with those who adore and praise it there are many people who have spent all their time after seeing the movie discussing it on various forums The most talked about issue is physics which makes sense since Gravity is a sci fi But I doubt any recent sci fi has ever been analysed so much and also hated and loved at the same time It s obvious that Gravity is a very interesting movie and it seems to be different from the usual stuff Hollywood gives us which should be appreciated Many people have been comparing it to 2001 A Space Odissey which I think best explains and summarizes the fame that s been building around Gravity ever since it came out The story in Gravity unfortunately is not as original as one may think Doctor Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer on her first mission in space while Matt Kowalski George Clooney is an astronaut on his last mission While trying to repair some damage on the Hubble telescope they are hit by debris from a destroyed satellite which wrecks the space shuttle Explorer leaving only Stone and Kowalski alive Kowalski uses his thruster pack to retrieve Stone who was sent away from the shuttle and together they make their way to the International Space Station Here Gravity becomes a survival thriller a very good one no doubt but still nothing more than that which is a shame since the setting alone allows more psychologically challenging developments I found the cast selection to be confusing why Clooney and Bullock They are not bad actors but I don t think they fit their roles Notably before Bullock was cast there were many other better options and even Robert Downey Jr who was also offered the role of Kowalski would have been better than Clooney playing himself Still both our main actors do a good job especially Bullock who spent months training for her role and even though their characters are not developed enough it s difficult to notice that since the story keeps you glued to your seat Gravity s opening scene is particularly amazing there are no sounds apart from the radio communications among the astronauts and Mission Control and a very long take going in circle shows us Earth the shuttle and the astronauts up close I admire Cuar n s decision to acknowledge there is no sound in space but I d rather have sounds than a soundtrack that s occasionally exaggeratedly loud and unnecessary Furthermore many people claim Gravity is scientifically inaccurate but unless you re a physicist or an aerospace engineer I don t think you will notice mind many of those mistakes besides Cuar n himself admits he adapted the physics to suit the plot Interestingly the movie is only 90 minutes long but feels much longer in a good way It also has a lower budget than many other epic sci fi movies but looks much better Actually Gravity is the most beautiful and tense movie I ve seen in a while with some perfectly directed scenes The tension is mostly built through very long takes and some POV shots In summary it all comes down to this the movie is visually stunning and has loads of potential but doesn t exploit it fully The dialogues and monologues are mostly clich d some even make you cringe Had it been a mostly silent movie had it concentrated on the psychological effect of the fear of imminent death on people Gravity would have been better But it would also have seemed like a Space Odissey ripoff and it definitely wouldn t have been a Hollywood movie Despite its flaws I recommend this movie because it s a unique experience Hollywood probably won t present us again soon Rating 8 10 Read more at http passpopcorn wordpress com,8

20 October 2013,Amazing Visual Effects,Ever since seeing IMAX Space Hubble 3D I have been fascinated with Space exploration Seeing the trailers reeled me in for this one Suspense explosions and space perfect combination Sandra Bullock gives a very compelling performance and you are on the edge of your seat from beginning to the very end You have no idea what s going to happen one moment to the next and I love that It was unpredictable and full of excitement The images are amazing and you feel as though you right there with Bullock completely and utterly alone scary George Clooney has a minimal role but as usual plays it well The visual effects are enough to make a night to see this film I would like to go back and see it in 3D,10
26 October 2013,A great simulation via 3D... U feel like floating in space..,This movie is absolute thrilling It gives u simulation how one feels while floating in space great camera work and actions absolute stunning 3D A space mission go wrong will to survive sacrifice a cool mind of an astronaut even while dying The only reason for not giving a 10 is that actually the story dips at a point for a moment and the story overall is not that different Moreover the movie will not give u same effect and feel while watching on DVD or TV As the real thing of this movie is the 3D effect which u can enjoy only in theater,8
17 December 2013,Amazing pictures but ....,Im not quite sure people that gave this movie 8 4 rating had seen the same movie i did For the picture it s amazing however i find the movie itself really boring with no twist or any interesting story It s a very similar movie to Buried I went to see the movie after seeing the rating on IMDb a decision i now live to regret I can understand some people really enjoyed the movie and i respect that Yet I can t really figure out how the movie could manage 8 4 10 rating I m now very careful with user ratings on IMDb,4
5 April 2014,"So bad, it's offensive to the force of gravity.",This movie is offensive to the force of gravity and offensive to physics in general It should be offensive to anyone with common sense The film got so much acclaim I assumed it was just off to a bad start I kept waiting for it to develop into something that didn t suck such an unbelievable amount of Rhino something worthy of acclaim acclaim despite a terrible start If I were the force of gravity I d want to sue for slander At least I d get some money back which would be the consolation prize since I will never get those precious hours back I m still laughing at the reviewer who correctly commented that Wyle E Coyote had better adherence to the laws of physics An understatement if anything If you are trying to decide between this movie and watching a color test pattern for 90 minutes go for the test pattern At least test pattern won t make you wretch in response to insipid predictable unrealistic canned dialog Oh yeah AND bad physics p s If you re ever in space with a hot scientist astronaut in zero gravity and your foot is snagged on space station cables and you ve got a tether between you BABY HOLD ON TIGHT because for some reason gravity will start pulling on you as if over a cliff,1

9 December 2013,Gravity Out Of This World,I have seen the movie I was very impressed at the effects I am not going to go into the movie for obvious reasons Highly recommend you go see this movie at the theater Don t wait for it to be released on DVD or Blue Ray you want to watch this on the largest screen possible Thoroughly recommend to go see this movie For a person that is not in too much to Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I was quite surprised that i enjoyed their characters in this movie You are in for an awesome ride so hold on to your seats your in for the ride of your life 3D would be impressive in this movie and would be an absolute hit with 3D Fans,10
28 January 2014,The true meaning of gravity...,Gravity is a movie which I think is very different from all the other space movies that we have seen and that s something that makes this movie unique and special I believe that Alfonso Cuar n did a great job in the direction of this movie and I also think that the interpretation of Sandra Bullock was really great I liked very much this movie because it made me think beyond the space that I used to know and show me the true meaning of gravity and how important it is I also liked very much the special effects that used to this movie and make it exceptional I heard from many people that Gravity was boring and I tried to think some of these spots that it maybe were boring but I could not find any Finally I have to tell you that I strongly recommend it and I believe that if you like space movies then I m sure that you will love it,8
8 August 2021,Effects,I was very upset because I couldn t watch this movie in the cinema It s a movie to watch in the cinema Sandra takes the movie by herself,8
19 October 2013,A turning point in film history,Gravity is one of those movies that one has to watch to be part of film history it s a turning point in the film history time line A new film narrative is born the movement of the camera takes the audience into a different way of understanding the beautiful weirdness of space It made me believe that I was there in space what an achievement It is the director s job to make us feel the emotion to be part of the story to experience what the characters are going through and Cuar n just nailed that part Frame by frame it is perfect I can t easily say My favorite scene is when because it has so many awesome moments and it is a movie shot and edited so carefully with such detail that each frame can be analyzed and be semiotically interesting It is indeed a very smart use of 3D technology and this movie s success also proves that audiences love good surprises people need to be thrilled This movie is a must watch now and in the years to come,10

8 October 2013,Can't stop thinking about this film,I must tip my hat off to the director Alfonso Cuar n I honesty don t think anyone in Hollywood could have ever pulled this off the way he did I am a huge fan of movies especially sci fi thrillers and drama themed movies and this film seemed to merge all 3 genres in one The sheer claustrophobia from the pov from the actors view made you feel at times that you couldn t breathe and where in that space suit with them Yet the grand realistic looking CGI visuals of space and mother Earth made you feel the camera was actually filming from that very location I was not a fan of Sandra Bullock for many years When she first came out in the 1990 s I remember thinking she was an over hyped standard boring whiny actress that the industry for whatever reason wouldn t stop promoting until she became a household name I didn t think she deserved or earned any of the major roles she received throughout her career My mind did start to change when I saw the movie The Blind Side I do seem to prefer her more serious roles and less of her predictable romantic comedies Now after seeing this epic masterpiece of a film I think Sandra has clearly learned a thing or two about screen presence and actually acting smaller to get a point across She was simply brilliant and on her A game When I say acting small It s kind of what George Clooney does in all of his movies You never see him putting on a show he just acts He acts like an normal guy in the same situation would act It s so simple but it has the most desirable effect It s real and it s done well Not every actor is expected to give us a character like poor Johnny Depp who is plagued with every role he now lands having to be even bigger and more larger than life of the previous role Sandra in this movie is likable easy to watch and you can believe her story and feel the pain fear of her situation as the movie progresses I have never felt that way about any Sandra Bullock performance until now Without question an Oscar contender for both Sandra Bullock and Alfonso Cuar n,10

4 October 2013,IMHO best movie ever!,Short movie review of Gravity After being an observer at IMDb for several years I have decided to make an account the reason is this movie Gravity Just came back from this movie and I really had the feeling I was in space for the last 90 minutes or so Sometimes the tension was to much to handle there where some really scary moments during this movie The effects also tricked me in believing I was really up there never did I had the feeling that the CGI effects where faked it looked like the real thing The 3d effects also where top notch The acting from SB GC was also very realistic and both performed very well To sum things up Best movie I have ever seen Why Original story also liked skipping the unnecessary interlude straight to the action Great cast acting Fantastic SE Great ambiance Optimal usage of 3d effects It really does its name Gravity justice you will understand this when you have seen the movie This movie was so good that after seeing it I would never even if given the opportunity think about going to space it scarred the sh t out of me the movie acting story sound effects ambiance really catches the claustrophobic and fragile dependency on machinery very well Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie in 3D,10

5 October 2013,New Experience and Inspirational.,I went to this movie just because of Alfonso Cuar n It turned out to be a great new experience A great movie to get inspired The movie makes you realize how hard it is to be an Astronaut This is a must watch for everyone especially for those who want to become an Astronaut It makes you forget that you are on earth I just felt i was on space The script is short and sweet no flash backs lot of emotions woo what a musical score by the Steven Price its mind blowing George Clooney as always cool and awesome Great performance by Sandra Bullock Definitely a movie to watch again,9
6 November 2013,"Gravity's charm is in it's bare simplicity, but it brings along flaws",This is how I would explain Gravity to someone who has not seen the movie without spoilers but explaining exactly what they will see First take a regular Michal Bay ish screenplay about a space disaster Got it OK so now you take the first 20 pages off usually the first act and throw them out Now rip off the last 10 pages the conclusion of act 3 and also throw them out Now you get a black marker pen and cross out every single reference or dialog involving Any character except George Clooney s or Sandra Bullock s Any scenes set in Houston or at other space stations Any references to explosions any references to how things should sound Now you get what is left and rewrite it to make it 3 times simpler but keeping any actions scenes you had OK Now it s time to shoot this baby So first you gotta have Cuaron the director watch 4 movies over and over again in order to get the feel and the references 1 Pixar s WALL E 2 Alfred Hitchcock s Rope 3 Any space walk scene from Brian de Palma s Mission 2 Mars 4 His own Children of Men one shot car sequence OK now make sure you get the best technical crew in Hollywood because this movie needs to look GREAT When it s time to mix the audio all the audio channels with noise mute them If the audio guys complain threat to fire them Jokes aside This is exactly how this movie feels A bare basic second act of a great action film Yeah there are technical inconsistencies and plot holes Yeah George Clooney is playing himself again But the charm of this movie is how Cuaron kept the good parts and only the good parts and made it work It s half of an action script with scenes that reminded me of the awful Mission 2 Mars but done in a good way However it s simplicity and stripped elements bring the feel that something is missing Movies have a structure that takes decades to change and although I am all in favor to change this is a bit too much in a single direction As for the long shots it feels gimmicky sometimes All in all a great theater experience but not something generally amusing to see on a TV or heaven s forbid your cell phone Go watch it,7
16 October 2013,The best space movie ever made!,I am a Sci Fi fan and have been watching space movies since my childhood but never seen anything like it before Tense spectacular outstanding and amazing visual effects You will feel like you are in space with Sandra Bullock This Sci Fi 3D film with Dolby Atmos will give you one of the most amazing 3D movie experience ever Before I was reluctant to watch 3D movies but Gravity changed it all Two people in the wilderness of space how possibly could both or anyone of them survive It is a very well put together film and outstanding piece of directing I would highly recommend seeing it in an IMAX 3D You may also check out the Dolby website and search for Dolby Atmos theaters near by Don t miss it Just go for it,9

23 November 2013,Made for 3D,If you watch this film as if it is a dream then the whole thing comes to life OK the physics don t all add up but wow what a 3D epic I normally dislike 3D but this is used perfectly The effects are stunning especially subtle aspects in which non photo realistic almost painted images are used and merged with more accurate photo realistic images All in all if you think of this as a worst nightmare situation then you will be thrilled watch it like any other film with a cynical eye then it will be OK Appreciate it for the art of using 3D to best effect and you ll love it especially in IMAX 3D WOW And forget about the physics details,8
14 April 2021,Really stirred up my motion sickness,Look everyone raved over this but it s just basically Speed but in space and and instead of a bus it s space station woooooo Sandra Bullock again plays Annie Porter who this time decides that space is a safer option than catching the LA metro or going on a Caribbean cruise The terrorist this time is those pesky Russian commies as their space related communist tomfoolery causes the station to get blown up George Clooney replaces Keanu Reeves as he was too busy doing John Wick which I find disappointing but given how garbage Speed 2 was apart from Willem Dafoe I totally understand why he turned this one down Anyway there s some convoluted plot where they try to space float across to another space station and that brings about some introspective conversations about as riveting as watching paint dry There s a whole bunch of first person perspective space tumbling which made me massivey nauseous and George Clooney dies because of something or other I can t quite remember as I was too busy vomiting up those quesadillas I had for lunch Anyway Sandra Bullock annoys me to no end and I m definitely not watching Speed 4 which presumably will be set in a Botox clinic considering how ageless Ms Bullock is Let s hope they bring back Willem for that one if he s not too busy starring in some black and white movie about lighthouses Jesus wept,3

5 March 2014,One of the coolest films i've seen in theaters,Now first I wanna address my favorite films of all time because Gravity has gotten a ton of hate and i wanna show you my favorites to add a little credibility to the review hopefully 10 Terminator 2 Judgement Day 9 Gravity 8 Pan s Labyrinth 7 The Dark Knight 6 Inception 5 District 9 4 Die Hard 3 Children of Men 2 Cool Hand Luke 1 Memento First I want to touch on the technical aspects Gravity is an achievement in how movies are made it deserved the five technical awards it received at the Oscars last Sunday Also it deserved its award for soundtrack too but i ll get to that in a second Gravity s special effects are so good and so well done that I believed it was filmed in space And the music the music adds to the weight of the film and it puts you in the front seat for an incredible thrill ride Also the direction Alfonso Curon directs the movie with such skill the first shot in the movie that is thirteen minutes long is incredible and in my opinion was what got the Oscar for cinematography and direction in the bag Now story this is what people seem to disagree on some say its filled with clich s and some say its good I personally feel its good because it pushes the film forward for what it really is focusing on the metaphors letting go moving on the themes drive the movie not the story itself That usually doesn t work here however it does because they choose themes that are relate able everyone has to let go in one point in their lives and learn to move forward to be reborn out of their despair Which this movie is very much so saying And I am fine with that with such a good part to it and in my opinion a great character to drive that metaphor i am fine with some of the things that don t add up like I understand that the space stations wouldn t be that close together Do I care No it is an enjoyable movie that deserves the awards its gotten and one I visited twice in theaters and will be watching many times at home Now with this being said do you have to like the movie Not at all art is subjective there s a lot of movies I don t like that much that some people really do for example Casino Royale I like the movie but not as much as most do also Iron Man 3 do I understand it Not really but its what others like I can t judge them for that if they have a good reason for not liking something or the opposite than good for them I just feel like when people attack others for liking or disliking something its a little much and that s coming from an avid movie lover Hope you enjoyed my review its one of my first on IMDb so be nice,10

11 October 2013,top hit for sure,If somebody would ask to describe this movie in a few words then I would call this movie as Best non alienated sci fi movie of 2013 or maybe even of all time It is hard to make good sci fi movie and it is doubly hard to make good non alienated sci fi movie This movie jumps that barrier for sure Somehow this movie reminds me another hit at least for me Solaris 2002 Some common things such as a Action of both movies happens in the some planet s orbit b George Clooney plays in both of them c Both movies tries to dig into human psychology Albeit Solaris dig a bit deeper d Basic line of events flows around man George and woman Sandra Gravity case Or Natascha Solaris case e Action in both movies concentrates around space station s But here similarities ends Solaris chose more human related problems to analyze deeply And Gravity chose to analyze more space tech related problems with sprinkle of human psychology Sandra and George duet is wonderful In first part of movie George acts as primary character then in second part Sandra takes control over George This switch is not bad but it makes to feel that character relations are a bit too asymmetric For example in Solaris movie George and Natascha was acting in more symmetrical way they were like two planets orbiting each other And in Gravity you have a feeling that somebody shoot George movie part after that Sandra movie part and then joined these two parts with digital movie editor Of course this flow of events is also interesting but for me symmetrical relations are more interesting to watch I would also recommend to see this movie in 3D format Let s say that Gravity is well optimized for 3D effects Maybe it is because plot is very suitable for this Dark space and debris floating around nothing has better options for 3D All in all you have to see this movie because as far as i can tell George picks only deep and interesting plots to act on And this is the case So go on and see it,10

13 October 2013,"Good film, very overrated.",I am definitely in the minority here but I will go ahead and admit that Gravity failed to impress me that much I went to the theater with very high expectations after hearing how it was the best movie of the year and seeing its 97 score on Rotten Tomatoes Although I thought that yes Gravity was good it was not nearly as amazing as the critics made is out to be The visual effects are obviously the best aspect of Gravity The scenery was stunning and some of the effects the filmmakers were able to pull off were awe inducing Another great aspect of the film was its ability to thrill and stress the audience Gravity was made centered around the audience Sandra Bullock s performance was mostly very good There were parts that I felt her acting went a bit over the top The main aspect of Gravity that I had a problem with was the characters or lack thereof The movie obviously centered itself around Sandra Bullock s character almost too much so There were basically only two other actors that you ever saw I can understand why Alfonso Cuaron would do this to make the audience feel the sense of isolation but it was way too much With only one character to focus on the movie s plot was almost uninteresting Also another thing that bothered me was how clich Sandra Bullock s character was Her back story is almost identical to every other Hollywood Blockbuster character s story Overall the visuals were fantastic but the plot and characters were only so so I have seen critics mention these downfalls before then defend Gravity by saying that it isn t a movie about the story its about the visuals Yet I find it somewhat ironic that these same critics praising Gravity slammed Avatar back in 2009 for it being all about the visuals So yes Gravity is good It s a nice solid movie But it is not a movie to watch more than once or to watch outside of a theater Undoubtedly Gravity will win a substantial amount of awards I am not saying that it does not deserve it I can tell that the filmmakers put their heart and souls into making this film but Gravity still has several weak points that should have been fixed,7
16 October 2013,Gravity Review,It was a great film Loved the way it was shot I take my hat off to both George Clooney Sandra Bullock A performance The only thing that was an upset was the fact that George Clooney was not present for the entire film I would guess thats why the movie trailer was so short and did not really show much because had they showed you the film was more based on Sandra Bullock it might not have pulled what it did in box office But none the less still a great film and I would recommend it to viewers who have not yet watched it Y Its also interesting due to the fact this film had such a small cast Literally you could count the amount of cast members on 2 hands Very interesting stuff,10
20 December 2016,Disappointed!,96 on metacritic com Did I actually watch the same movie Gravity is boring and lame There is nothing you will not expect You know exactly what is going to happened next so you just keep looking at your watch and hoping it is going to end soon I had huge expectations and I am really disappointed Time New York Post and the number of other high profile magazines and newspapers gave the movie 100 Did you guys actually watch the movie Is it really thrilling Can you please tell me where The beginning is boring the middle is even worse and the end is simply pathetic Do not waste your money and time You can do many more interesting things that in 1 5h than to watch this disaster,4
9 December 2013,A visual feast.,First off if you haven t seen this film go see it on the big screen today preferably in 3D Gravity has excellent CGI which it uses to bring us breathtaking shots of planet Earth and the silent tranquility of space Sandra Bullock delivers a fine performance in this The film is highly tense especially earlier on There are some nice emotional themes in this film that moved me Alright so this film has received a lot of universal acclaim However I will say it is overrated Yes it is beautiful and fairly solid But it suffers mostly from two factors that keep it from greatness First is George Clooney s character He might as well have been a charismatic robot because his characters was utterly unrealistic Second around the last half of the movie Murphy s Law apparently decides to set the universe against Sandra who miraculously doesn t die on several occasions Willing suspension of disbelief takes some serious blows,8
9 October 2013,Seen this so many times before...,As you listen to the critics gush you hope this will be the movie you have waited for all year The movies starts looks spectacular the use of the 3D is cute but reminds me of the Michael Jackson ride at Disneyland 3D effects for the purpose of 3D effects nothing more I do think they give you a good feel for weightlessness and the claustrophobia of space I think Bullock is good but I m having Danny Ocean in space seemed a bit over the top The movie run time is only 90 minutes but I felt like it was a very LONG 90 minutes The plot is completely predictable and offers nothing new This is worth seeing for the visual look but beyond that there is not much here All I felt after leaving this movie was added respect for the astronauts of Apollo 13 Go but the critics are just wrong on this one it is OK but nothing special,7
23 December 2013,"Brilliant Effects & production, otherwise disappointing.",For the special effects and production I would award 10 10 and it is worthy of an Oscar nomination for that alone if there is such a category However the script is pitiful the dialog for the most part banal and even for someone with a basic high school knowledge of physics the technical feasibility is way way off in far too many areas to list OK it s a movie and we can expect a degree of artistic license with the science but really this is so way off that the whole movie loses credibility No complaints about the acting given the script they had to work with but I don t see anything especially worthy of nominations or awards for these performances So 10 10 for the effects 4 10 for the everything else 6 10 overall but worth watching just for the zero gravity effects,6
19 January 2014,The modern 2001: A Space Odyssey,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
6 February 2014,Boring,Every good movie needs a good story Gravity on the other hand had no story Gravity may have some stunning visual effects but the story line is very predictable and extremely boring My wife and I actually had to watch this in two sitting We ended up watching a different movie 15 minutes in because we couldn t take it However I convinced her to finish watching it thinking it has to get better it must get better I was wrong The ravishing reviews are misleading Either that or I must have watched a completely different movie,1
12 March 2014,"Raises the bar, the silence of space will never be the same",Astronauts are left stranded in space when debris hits their shuttle with a limited air supply they are left fighting for survival Director Alfonso Cuaron offers an interesting intense tour de force that will leave most viewers with sweaty palms and a lump in their throat Sandra Bullock is above her usual form as Stone while Matt Kowalski s cock sure character played by George Clooney s is as exceptional as the first rate special effects on display Considering the small cast the pace is fast with never a dull moment as it moves from one spacewalk to the next The film feels very much based in reality the first person perspective shots are used sparingly and effectively they add to the claustrophobic feeling in contrast to sweeping views and emptiness of space which adds to the tension Orbit and space has never felt or looked so real thanks to the benchmark effects While the story doesn t break any new ground it s a basic yarn visually it excels all expectations Alfonso and Jon s Cuar n s screenplay has some interesting touches and dialogue one of which notably features Clooney s character and overall it comes full circle to a satisfying conclusion Cuaron and crew s faultless execution coupled with a fitting soundtrack score and some fantastic sound design deliver a heart pounding and moving tale A milestone cinema which raises the special effects bar highly recommended,

14 February 2014,Overrated & deceived by IMDb,This is just a over rated movie I am deceived by IMDb ratting that s all The running time of the movie is 83 mins only still it is slow predictable movie Usually this type of movie deals with thriller mystery adventure twist turn but u will not found single content of this There is not any single moment in the movie for which u will surprise or bite your nail Just a straight movie nothing to offer Highly disappointing Movie better than this one have lower ratting in IMDb For example Sunshine Moon Aliens both 2001 A Space Odyssey is much more better than this one Even any Star Trek movie is better than this crap I am surprised how this movie got so many nomination in Oscar golden globe waste of time,1
6 April 2014,"No way, never again",Okay So Leonardo Dicaprio got zilch and this is making over 100 million in profit and about 3 Oscars Wrong is not the word outrageous is By far the most boring cheesy hopeless production I have ever witnessed Hands up to the caterer in the credits you must have by far had the best job If you want to continue with your life in this earth do not even bother with this go watch the Muppet s or the Lego movie which by the way are about 726481 times better Goodnight x,1
5 October 2013,Amazing. Stunning,This movie was amazing Outstanding visual achievement Watching Gravity made you feel like you were in space The shots of earth and the sun in the distance were stunning to watch But what made this film even more fantastic was Sandra Bullock She gave a truly amazing performance She proved she is a great actress in not just a comedic role but in a dramatic one as well I ve never felt more connected to a character on screen than i did with ms Bullocks Ryan Stone Very emotional at times She tapped into every human emotion Truly amazing She deserves an Oscar nomination for this I also want to praise the director Alfonso Cuaron for his great visual style the camera work that he did made you feel like you were in Sandra bullocks spot At moments while watching Gravity i found myself holding my breath I was at the edge of my seat I can t recommend this film enough Go watch it,10
6 June 2020,My opinion,Great visual bad movie in overall There is a lot of movies which are better than this one,6
14 June 2021,By FAR the best space film ever especially in GLORIOUS 3d!! Its like being in space!!,This is Visually an absolute masterpiece of film making My wife and I have seen this film about a dozen times and it actually gets better everytime we watch it The 3d is spectacular the visuals are FLAWLESS This film may not compare to dated space films like 2001 but sorry folks it blows them all away for entertainment We over analyze movies all the time talking about plot character development etc Its actually very simple was it entertaining That s the 1 and really only thing that a film should be judged by and OMG was this film ENTERTAINING IT literally takes your breath away 90 minutes of silence and you cant take your eyes off of this work of art FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE,10

16 October 2013,Movie of the DECADE.,This is how movies should be made Forget anything you have seen before and don t ask me to compare this to any other movie it would be incredibly unfair to any other movie maker to be compared to such an immaculate piece of visual perfection Gravity is not just a movie it s a complete experience I m talking about the 3D IMAX version of course not just a visual experience the whole nine yards I m talking about the feeling of nausea you get because of the slow camera spin of the immense space background behind the actors I m talking about your leg muscles clenching by the end of the movie when you realize you re finally back to earth A complete experience Alfonso Curon is undoubtedly a genius An accoladed inventor of sorts The movie other than being a visual marvel of massive proportions delivers an amazing journey with the only two characters played by the amazing Sandra Bullock and the astounding George Clooney I wouldn t say it was the performance of their careers but definitely one of their best performances ever The film score by Steven Price hits just the right notes at the right times and complements the visual experience by a climactic auditory orgasm Yea no other way to describe this This is what you should be doing this weekend spending 1 and a half hours of pure joy in the theater with those 3D eye glasses on drooling to Gravity,10
28 January 2014,Most unique experience ever had,Ignore all the negative reviews and go see it for yourself and then make the judgment I had so much doubt at the first place seeing all these bad reviews then this movie got nominated for so many awards I finally decided to go and watch it in 3D when I came out of the theater I was totally satisfied and amazed by the movie In my own personal opinion all the haters are just too shallow and premature to comprehend this masterpiece No offense All they complain it there is no story or plots that s because they were not able to see beyond the story itself there are a lot more deep and meaningful elements inside the seemingly simple plot,10

1 September 2023,Existentialism at its best,A visual and thematic powerhouse Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity takes us on an adventure travel into space and tells us that life in and around the space stations orbiting our planet is beautiful and breathtaking It is also harmless and peaceful as long as everything goes according to plan But when an emergency situation arises every intrinsic human emotion of helplessness isolation and mortality is multiplied out there and the real horror that unfolds in space is not a battle against aliens and the unknown but rather a battle against the laws of physics This is the genius of Gravity the most stirring and realistic save a couple of details sci fi human drama to come out of Hollywood in a long time And space is merely the setting for it the thematic backdrop if you like It s not treated as a blank canvas for filmmakers to smudge with their overdone rendition of the cliched space antagonist and ensuing battles which is refreshing Instead Cuar n uses all his skill to project the sinister nature of the story two astronauts fighting for survival against all odds in an environment they know all about in theory but that their bodies are not designed to sustain in practice It s existentialism at its best The screenplay written by Cuar n and his son Jon s is brilliant in all its simplicity and brought to life by a superb performance from Sandra Bullock coupled with magnificent use of special effects The result is probably the most visually astounding film of the CGI era and Cuar n s confident spacing and elegant use of panning into POV shifts and long takes that go from quiet to action filled and back gives us in the audience a feeling of floating around in space with our two protagonists I have never seen a film conveying the feeling of weightlessness as well as Gravity does The title says it all really I already mentioned Sandra Bullock who gives her best performance since Speed here No wait strike that her best performance ever Her character grows into the predicament she finds herself in and Bullock is able to project her struggles in a forceful physical manner that leaves you unnerved and energized at the same time Rarely have I walked out of the cinema appreciating the ground that I walk on more than I did after having seen Gravity Wow,10
2 March 2014,Edge of your seat ride!,This is the first time that I have felt sufficiently impressed in recent times to put my hands on a keyboard and actually express my opinion about a film Gravity is a mind blowing extravaganza of edge of your seat suspense and the perfect example of what pure movie magic is about From its stunning cinematography superb acting with a limited cast faultless production and exceptional use of 3D CGI Gravity is a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of lifelessness in space and the sheer struggle of life over death in the most hopeless of situations Gravity whilst sharing it s disaster theme with many other movies is something new that goes deeper particularly in the scenes where Ryan talks about her daughter at least thats how I saw it A huge technical achievement and a film that will stand the test of time Bullock deserves her 15 cut of the movie grossing s for this performance 10 10,10
19 April 2016,Less than meets the eye,This is a lost in space style story with the theme being on the isolation and helplessness of the character Aside from a few voices and corpses there are only two characters here and pretty much just one That s okay It makes this more of a stage play set in outer space but with some action replacing dialog This has always been big with directors to have just one or two characters The problem is that if you just develop one or two characters you better use the hour or more of developing to do a fantastic job because there s no excuse otherwise The character development falls very flat and honestly a good writer could do this much in a ten minute short story That s not to say it s a bad film It is watchable the story is good enough and the director succeeds in an obvious although somewhat expository attempt at showing the reality of floating in Space The reality theme of space is efficient but also looks contrived to fit an agenda contrived to fit the scenario Not as contrived as most Hollywood movies however The acting is sub par Two huge names but little talent This would have been much better with two completely unknown theater majors or graduates who were more theater and less Hollywood because the director obviously wanted this to be more theater and less Hollywood but the acting foiled any chance this had to be spectacular A lot of it is poor dialog Very formula dialog which is okay if you re going Hollywood or James Bond but not if you re attempting reality Drama The premise is good the logistics work well and technically this is fine and it isn t a total waste It just isn t anything more than a very definitive 6 10,6
27 July 2014,Possibly the worst ever,I d heard a few generic comments about this move which lead me to think it would be good Boy was I wrong For someone with the vaguest notion of how things actually take place in space it became obvious within the first 30 seconds that this movie would be painful to endure It was It is clear that the creators had no idea about the elements of orbital dynamics rendezvous and docking space to ground communications EVA performance mission specialist expertise and training or the propagation of space debris Each of these are central to major plot points and each of them are presently in a deeply flawed and wildly farcical manner For a viewer even moderately educated in technology enduring this stupidity is a trial More importantly for viewers who don t know how deeply flawed this story line is they re likely to assume that the movie is a reasonable presentation of the environment The producers have gutted basic physical laws to find excuses for drama and explosions In the process they have made major progress in lowering our collective knowledge of the real world I suspect if these producers had done Titanic it would have been something like this Titanic leaves from Miami The Soviets determine there is a secret microdot on board so they have a nuclear sub tow an iceberg into it s path The iceberg is hit and the ship starts to sink The crew panics so Jack takes over as captain and Rose takes over running the engines and boilers single handed because she learned how to do that in finishing school They decide to dock the ship and so sail to the iceberg and tie up Realizing the iceberg won t save everyone they chip off some ice put it in their drinks and think of a new plan They decide they can patch the hole with whale blubber so they get the shrimp from the galley stick it on the anchor and lower it as a giant fish hook They immediately catch a whale and use the blubber to patch the hole in the hull Unfortunately the whale they caught Flubby was the favorite of the pod The rest of the pod start attacking the ship in anger Jack realizes the only solution is for him to swim for help so he jumps overboard and swims 300 miles to land He finds help but realizing the ship only has 15 minutes to live he had to convince the Coast Guard to use their new experimental 40 rescue boat the only vessel that can cover 300 miles in 15 minutes They arrive in the nick of time and load all 2200 people on board the 40 boat Someone learning the history of the Titanic from that script would be in the same position as someone learning about space from this disaster The movie also attempts to pay homage to others probably 2001 and Barbarella It is an insult to both and Barbarella was more realistic The CGI was probably good but using decent CGI on this story is like Monet painting on a giant horse turd The result may look pretty but it still stinks and draws flies It would have been so easy to create a credible movie set in space that celebrated human resilience But that would have meant giving up explosions and treating the audience like they had a brain,1
28 February 2014,"Wow, what a waste of time. stay away",I can t understand what s all the fuss is about nothing special at all nice CGI and good music and good message but that s it trust me all the way through the 90 minutes i was thinking of stopping the movie and watching something else and i can t say such a feeling happen to me very often Anyhow to be honest i think the movie deserve a 6 rating It s boring no story line the acting is mediocre it s boring and it s boring again Only watch this if there is no other movie left on earth I wish i knew this before hand If you are after fictions there are far better movies out there which are more exciting I would go with space odyssey 100 times instead of watching this once,1
15 November 2014,Hostile environment,When something comes out of space to threaten someone in the movies it s usually a gigantic object Armageddon or an alien invasion Independence Day Gravity tells us about tiny objects space debris with an average size of less than an inch that s a very clever idea to start with And it s not the whole planet that needs to be saved only 2 people have to find a possibility how to get safely back on the ground that s all Less definitely means more in this case because when they spend the majority of the budget on the special effects it s exceptional that the human characters remain in the centre of our attention The show never gets into the foreground all the spectacular sights merely provide the background for the 2 actors In opposite to Silent Running it doesn t hit you with a message either It s entertainment and very well made even if as some previous reviewers pointed out I need not repeat the same points here some physics are dodgy but a list of technically completely accurate sci fi flicks would be very short The makers of Gravity succeeded in making outer space a convincing hostile environment But in the first place Gravity stands out from many soulless sci fi flicks due to its human qualities Surely not a movie to be forgotten easily I ll probably remember it like Oh yes the movie with the 2 astronauts drifting in space,9

10 November 2013,Now that's what I call Entertainment,The title is telling Set in orbit around the Earth there is virtually no gravity here but thanks to a freak accident very soon the gravity of the situation becomes terrifying Gravity and oxygen are not the only things in short supply in this film there are only two characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and in consequence not a lot of dialogue but if there is a paucity of words there is almost an excess of wonder and drama in this terrific movie from Mexican director Alfonso Cuardon Pan s Labyrinth Although years in the making Cuardon who also co wrote the script with his son does not waste time with scene setting or character exposition on Earth Immediately we are suspended in space marvelling at the silence and gloriousness of it all At the other end of the story Cuardon does not bother with Hollywood style codas to lighten the mood Gravity ends exactly when it should In between there is never a moment when you are not captivated by what is happening on screen And for once a blockbuster does not overrun its time coming in at just an hour and a half Bullock and Clooney are excellent in portrayal of very different characters who will live or die by the other s decisions She is Ryan Stone the mission specialist with no previous time in space who becomes fear personified He is Matt Kowalski the space veteran on his last mission who never loses his charm or cool The crisis they face is so predictable if hopefully unlikely that it has a name in the scientific community community the Kessler syndrome For movie fan like me there are so many allusions to earlier films the floating majesty of the opening scene recalls the first view of space in 2001 when the astronauts are warned by Houston mission control of the impending danger the voice is that of Ed Harris from Apollo 13 when Bullock takes off her bulky space suit we are inevitably reminded of Sigourney Weaver at the end of Alien I saw Gravity at London s newest multiplex Cineworld at Wembly s London Designer Outlet and I opted to view in 3D which i normally avoid and D BOX which I have never experienced before I can t say that the tilting seat added that much to the enjoyment of the movie but the 3D was terrific Not since Avatar have I felt that the extra dimension worked so well I really felt as if I was in space and there is an especially moving moment involving a single tear Some of the science may be suspect but the brilliant special effects made it all too real for me,
13 October 2013,Gravity lacks Gravitas,Alfonso Cuar n is a brilliant technical director known for peppering his films with impossible shots like Gravity s epic opening 17 minute tracking shot his camera seemingly floating lazily in space with his characters Indeed the technical achievement in Gravity is glorious the sumptuous visuals and constantly flowing camera work giving a visceral sense of what it must be like to be orbiting Earth in zero g This is particularly true in 3D so unless you are prone to motion sickness I would highly recommend trying to see this in 3D something I don t normally recommend Cuar n s handling of the film s pacing is similarly excellent Any reviewers you read that call this film boring have obviously been watching too many video games or were put off by the lack of hyperactive editing there are a great many very long free moving shots in the film because the film s running time is a very short 91 minutes and the action begins within the first 5 and doesn t let up until almost the very last frame Where the film lacks is in story It s a difficult story to manage well on film because there are only two characters whose faces you see on screen at all so the entire weight of the film falls squarely upon the shoulders of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and the believability of their performances In this regard the film is in good hands because regardless of whether or not you like the characters they portray both actors turn in solid nuanced utterly real performances that especially for Sandra Bullock are nothing short of jaw dropping The real problem with the story in Gravity is that the characters back story some of which is pivotal to the understanding of the film can only be revealed by the characters themselves in monologues essentially due to the lack of other characters in the film and the disjointed each in their own spacesuit nature of their interactions This leads to some pretty on the nose dialogue and exposition which detracts from an otherwise exhilarating experience The only other complaint I have about the film is the score which swings between silent and overblown far too quickly and far too often There are also some fairly significant scientific errors that will annoy the sci fi crowd but shouldn t detract from the film for the less scientifically inclined Still this is an intelligent visually stunning film a thing of beauty that is very definitely worth a visit to the theatre especially if you are going to see it in 3D,8
25 October 2013,"The best 3D experience ever so far, and also a great artistic movie",Alfonso Cuar n created a visual experience that cannot be matched by any movie currently period And having watched it on 3D it felt like this was the only 3D was ever created since this was the only 3D I have really ever enjoyed Gravity is a successfully audacious movie that stretches contemplative pictures smoothly choreographed like a delicate dance into long takes there is even an 18 minute long one The silence of the space the picture of earth home always on the background associated with some beautifully positioned plans and adding only two characters transports the audience to a feeling that I honestly cannot remember with such intensity since 2001 A Space Odyssey even if they are much much different in presentation There is a mix of digital techniques being used as said by Cuar n himself Knowing that and seeing the result feeling so real is indeed outstanding However this movie isn t an experimental exercise on art and we have a storyline that needs to be addressed Cuar n keeps it simple and does it right yes but there is some stuff that could be questioned The storyline and character development is only briefly presented on screen even if it has a powerful meaning leaving the question as if did Cuar n meant to take a deeper study on humanity s condition in pure loneliness and plus out of its home through that same human symbolic simpleness that ends up being showed on screen or did Cuar n just feel the need of supporting the movie with the characters backstory so that it could be a safer view for a larger audience Whichever the answer Gravity is a landmark an author s work that changes the space genre for modern times as 2001 Space Odyssey did in 1968 Check out thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more reviews,8

6 October 2013,"Just when one thought that ""After ""Alien"" & ""Aliens"", Sci-Fi goes generally downhill"", there's ""Gravity""",In space no one can hear you scream In the past this ALAWAYS symbolizes Alien for me arguably the best Sci Fi film ever Next came Aliens the movie which puts James Cameron at the A category However after these 2 I thought What a pity Sci Fi is such an amazing genre but from here it s going generally downhill Then came the year 2013 Somewhere around late August or so I came across this ad with the trailer an upcoming Sci Fi film called Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I thought Hey even if this won t be a great Sci Fi it ll still be a box office hit THEN I watched the trailer and as god be my witness it was one of the fastest 2 minutes of my life and goosebumps went all over my body I thought God please bring back the awesomeness space movies used to have FINALLY I was lucky enough to catch a sneak preview in my country yesterday night Boy did I regret Starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney with Ed Harris I dare not say that this is as good as or better than Alien and or Aliens but I won t be surprised to see Gravity at next year s Academy Awards Essentially if you re a Sci Fi cinemaniac and you enjoyed Alien and or Aliens welcome back to space with zero Gravity 10 10,10
1 April 2018,Not a science fiction but close to reality,Be ready to start with Gravity an emotional and dramatic space story close to reality I watched it on the flight from New York to Zurich by seat screen With great special effects this movie kept all the running time my attention It was never boring and as in The Martian the ingredients brought together a nonstop stunning trip in the universe around of our planet See it and surprise yourself 7 10,7
22 October 2013,"Good but not great, like I hoped",Gravity attempts to portray what astronauts would actually encounter on space missions how space walks would actually unfold and the hostility of the environment of space towards anything resembling Earthling life The ninety or so minutes of Gravity are the linear unfolding of a series of destructive events in the lives of Astronauts Ryan Sandra Bullock and Kowalski George Clooney Director s Alfonso Cuar n s hones in on these destructive events treating them as a single passing moment in time A moment of crisis As far as doing anything in space is ever considered routine Gravity opens with a group of astronauts undertaking what seem to be standard routine repairs to the outside of their ship The tone is jovial if not a little tense as Clooney zips around the ship s vicinity with a jet pack jokingly He wants to break the current space walk record of seventy five minutes But Mission Control suddenly issues a warning A massive field of space debris is headed straight for them From here on only chaos reigns as Cuar n begins to eliminate all probable positive outcomes one by one After the astronaut s ship is destroyed beyond repair Ryan and Kowalski attempt to propel themselves a floatable distance to a space station As they push forward through space s vacuum towards their beacon of hope space s vastness and hostility are emphasized along with their minisculity I hate space says Ryan somewhat lightheartedly This comes after she has just been precariously saved from a perpetual spinning away into deep space a particularly claustrophobic moment of the film or rather a moment in the extreme of claustrophobia s exact opposite Gravity has all the individual parts of a film rated high near a 10 but once the parts are assembled the whole is not equal to the parts Even though the film is shot in space and is set to depict a realistic portrayal of how events like these could take place the film is really just about Ryan a single human s struggle to survive and then with this revelation the epic space setting becomes incidental Problem Ryan is not an interesting character She seems ill prepared for such a dangerous space mission and when she talks about her daughter in a moment that I assume is used to attempt to ground the film in reality by showing us the why we don t care about her daughter The current situation at hand is much more interesting Including this talk about life back home was a mistake that took me out of the moment I don t care about Earth here I care about this amazing crisis taking place just above Earth A space movie should emphasize themes bigger than the individual The mission should be more important than the life of the astronaut Simply making it back to Earth alive is not an exciting enough conclusion Although maybe the best of her career Bullock still delivers a subpar portrayal of a character that is herself subpar I loved Cuar n s Children of Men and I feel here Cuar n s work is great From a technical perspective Cuar n s filmmaking is incredible the cinematography stunning the portrayal of space amazing so what went wrong Besides a storyline that fails to transcend human matters a factor that Cuar n may have been able to gloss over under different circumstances when a film centers on a single actor and that actor is Sandra Bullock to quote Yeats Things fall apart the center cannot hold More reviews at getthebonesaw blogspot com,7
19 January 2014,"""2001: A Space Oddessy"" has finally met its match",Gravity is about as perfect of a film as I ve seen in quite some time It delivered on all levels Script acting cinematography and symbolism The script was nearly flawless It was nicely paced had structure with obvious turning points and gave us just enough comic relief from its truly incredible level of suspense My only beef and this is minor I think the audience could ve have used some additional exposition between Harris Clooney and Bullock to help us better understand the origination of the threat Sandra Bullock deserves every ounce of accolade she s received thus far She wonderfully gave us Ryan Stone who began as a brilliant but morose astronaut and finished as an inspiration However Bullock couldn t of given us Stone without George Clooney as Matt Kowalski The two had amazing chemistry The cinematography was groundbreaking If you ever want to know what it feels like to be in space watch this film Although it was not as allegorical as 2001 it contained enough symbolism to give the film depth and meaning For some of us it may have been welcomed given the heavy themes of 2001,10
6 June 2014,Gravity has little pull,I will be the first to say that Gravity was one of the most wonderful films in regards to cinematography and audio I say audio because it is not so much the musical score which is brilliant but even more so the simplicity and silence which is rendered throughout the movie The emotional disconnect which is stirred when watching a lonesome person glide through space in the absence of sound is breathtaking However the plot What plot Unfortunately there is virtually no storyline I won t place any spoilers in my review but there is nothing mentally stimulating in this film other than a unusual and I will admit horrifying experience,3
20 October 2013,The GRAVITY of this cinematic masterpiece is path-breaking!,Now it is going to be hard to review Gravity without letting slip any spoilers Yet i believe i have done an excellent job of it Gravity unlike any other Alfonso Cuar n film has broken all the box office records except for Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban which also mind you screams ALFONSO in every frame To be honest it deserves all the success To even begin to imagine how Alfonso went about conceptualizing the idea and the screenplay for this film boggled me to no end Reason being some scenes being so engrossing and that he actually knows on what part of the frame the audience are going to focus That he goes for a bokeh in scenes which you would least expect it yet they are so bang on that you would not realize it a second too soon So Alfonso deserves a double thumbs up Coming to dissecting the actors performances Sandra Bullock is the man of the hour Very few actors have been given an opportunity to shine like Bullock has been and she does 147 justice to it She has succeeded in invoking pathos for her character which is of a very common insecure woman who has seen her fair share of problems in life It grips you when the actor is so accomplished in her trade to point of passive dexterity Enough said The genius of Gravity lies in spinning a most terrific tale of Space travel which is so fragile and beautiful that it connects on a subconscious level Lucky is the director to have been able to envisage and be able to exploit the concept of helplessness of man in space so amazingly before anybody else was able to do it Gravity in the years to come will achieve a kind of cult status nevertheless yet it will never be as popular as space sagas like Star Wars series or Superhero movies like Dark Knight trilogy Because it lacks in star power and pre release hype which the other movies got The way this movie will grow on you will surprise you to no end Yet if the director or anybody do decide to make a sequel to this film whether it turns out or be good or bad i think it will be a sacrilege to the film and they deserve no forgiveness That is the respect which i have for films like this which are in a class of their own Myself being an avid amateur astronomer the movie spoke to me at a very deep level Hope everyone enjoys this film like i have Watch it when you have a weekday to kill with a fellow movie buff or watch it on a weekend with all the fanfare and a large group of friends It doesn t matter because you will love it anyhow,9

19 July 2014,Close to the worst movie of all time,The graphics are quite fancy BUT this is the most predictable movie of all time We gasped aloud 5 seconds before Sandra Bullock did knowing exactly what was coming next making it quite a boring movie It s not very often in a movie that you wish the main character would die but at one point in an emergency shuttle I wish she left the oxygen off and the movie ended Fair enough its fiction but it is 90 minutes I ll never get back and the only rationale around the high ratings is that people were so blown away in IMAX with the effects they forgot they were watching close to the worst movie of all time It moved relatively quickly into each new chapter so to speak but given that each chapter was so bland it still never got going despite the quick pace it just moved from one corny predictable story line to the next which becomes quite frustrating Save yourself the time watch something else you re missing out on nothing watching paint dry is more riveting,2
24 January 2021,Excellent movie. One of the best on space subject,Excellent movie One of the best on space subject Concedes likely only to Interstllar It is interesting by the study and reality the realism of the events hides the main lack of the movie very just a plot But here the main thing visual effects first of all distract on themselves attention,9
22 November 2013,You'll feel like you're in space with them,I finally got around to seeing Gravity and it was one epic experience that certainly lived up to the hype Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone yes she s a chick with a guy s name a medical engineer on her first mission in outer space accompanied by George Clooney s Matt Kowalsky a veteran astronaut who s on the brink of retirement Everything seems to be going smoothly until an accident involving space debris destroys their shuttle leaving the two of them floating aimlessly in space where no one can hear them and no one can find them All they have is each other as they try to make it out of their terrifying predicament alive Just imagining being in that situation is freaking me out right now as I m writing this When I first saw the trailer I thought the idea seemed original and it looked like it could be entertaining but I wondered how much of a plot and how much character development could occur in a movie that seemed to be merely about two people stranded in space It turns out that my skepticism was unjustified as it offered more than just an amazing visual experience The plot may be basic but it s laid out extremely well The two main characters especially Ryan Stone have interesting enough back stories to keep the audience interested and focused on more than just how tremendous everything looked Sandra Bullock gave an excellent performance It s hard to believe that 20 years ago she was driving a bus with Keanu Reeves breathing down her neck She may even get a second Oscar nomination and stick the middle finger up to anyone who said her 2010 win for The Blind Side was an undeserved fluke George Clooney did what he did best he acted like George Clooney I have never truly felt like I was there when watching a movie until I saw this one I imagine that this is the closest anyone could get to experiencing what it s like to be in space without actually being there Everything looked so real it was unreal This is the first time I can say that seeing a film in 3D was worth the extra admission price It would ve been even more awesome to see it in IMAX but I waited until over a month after its release like a dumbass so it had already been yanked out of IMAX theaters The 3D alone was awesome nevertheless and I can t even imagine seeing it in 2D By grossing over 500 million worldwide Gravity has deservingly become one of the biggest films of the year and looks to be a serious contender once awards season rolls around If you haven t yet I highly recommend checking it out in theaters while you still can,9
17 December 2013,An existential brooding with an ache for home and appreciation for life.,Gravity is a visual masterpiece Oh well You might have heard this compliment for this movie so many times that you would be giving a big yawn at this very moment But then you have to understand that not mentioning the visual marvel that the movie is would be a gross injustice to the painstaking works of four and a half years the movie took to be made Gravity is a story of two astronauts tethered to each other adrift in the vastness of space Now to begin it it may seem that there is not much of a story to build upon or much of a character to create And given its adherence to reality and science you would think what would be there to interest you for the ninety minutes of its running time Well there are the great visuals The opening shot contains some of the finest view of earth from the space The imagery it creates of the space is beautiful as well as haunting at the same time The movements of the characters and objects in the gravity and zero gravity are captured beautifully and the way beautiful set pieces explode in the space is just breathtaking But saying that the movie relies heavily on the visual gimmick would be a huge mistake The story has a flow and way of building up tension by creating hurdles after hurdles in the way of survival of the astronauts Being rooted so much to its documentary style survival drama it surprised me how much tension it created from the nothingness of space Visual Flawless Check Tension Exists Glitches here and there Will come to that later Check Now characters There is only one character that matters In fact Alfonso Cuaron says that everything in the movie is a metaphor for that character the character played by Sandra Bullock Dr Ryan Stone Concerning the initial character arc the first half seems to be bit disappointing It establishes well the coolness of the head and limitless courage needed to survive in the harshness of the space as well as the humour and banter needed to keep the aloofness or the isolation in the limitless space away But what it seems to fail to establish is the character The conversation seems to run into the mundane with the words like learn to let it go So many times I have heard that stuff that every time my boring bell goes off after I hear them It instills into you the sad realisation that the director is trying desperately to infuse some humanist core to the story And then coming to the second apparent drawback in the first half The tension As said earlier it exists but it fails to garner my investment into it The big set pieces exploding The characters drifting I am on my seat s edge But my emotional investments are lacking It is like hell with them I would care less if they die But it is in the second half the movie clears all your apprehensions all your complains all your doubts and it shines Everything fits The tension escalates The stakes rise You discover that the journey of the character s self discovery or transformation commandeered the mood of the movie And once the transformation hits home you sit there breathing and holding and breathing with the character on the edge of your seat rooting with all might that the gravity take her home The first half compliments the second half in a way that will leave you all satisfied It is not a great character work but it is praiseworthy and admirable for its perfect juxtaposition of humanist drama with the space survival story of a soul in all its isolation Gravity is a wonder child of Alfonso Cuaron and the only way you can justify his four and half years of his work is by viewing on the biggest screen with 3D glasses Gravity is a science fiction with awe and wonder for the infinity of space captured impeccably on the celluloid but at its heart it is an existential brooding with an ache for home and appreciation for life,9

15 November 2013,Not the film of the decade,There has been a massive amount of hype about this movie from the critics so I made the effort to see it at the big screen in 3d It is a very good movie and I enjoyed it greatly But I don t agree with the acclaim the critics have given it Once you strip away the cgi this is a plain disaster movie like Tower Inferno Airport or the Poseidon Adventure But it only centres on two characters so you don t get the wide array of personalities or the fodder to fall foul of the environment Clooney and Bullock are great but even in zero gravity Bullock is weighed down by the baggage of her previous movies There wasn t really enough time for me to get to know the characters so I didn t really engage with them There is some rather hammy symbolism regarding rebirth and the characters are blessed and cursed luck wise everything that can go wrong does but often they manage to grab that fortuitous root sticking out the side of the cliff that saves them from falling Watching this film in 3d strengthened by existing distain for the format and as there is no sound in space I didn t feel like the cinema s Dolby added anything and I would have been happy to wait for DVD In short I greatly enjoyed it but fail to see what all the fuss is about,
2 April 2023,Cliche ruined it.,When the movie started out by saying there is no sound in space I thought I will finally get a movie that depicts space correctly But only a few minutes into the movie my hopes were ruined I m not sure if realism is what the director wanted or not but there were very unrealistic moments to create a typical Hollywood cliche Like You have to let me go I m not letting you go scene we ve seen so many times in movies But they do this in zero gravity They are both stopped No momentum and no outside force acting on them But one gets sucked into outer space like there s a black hole On top of that the main character is frustratingly obtuse She s keep talking about getting into the space ship to save Clooney but she actually doesn t move Just keeps talking about I m gonna save you but just stays there When the alarm went off for debris to hit again she s admiring the view These are just bad directions Overall it could ve been a good movie Ruined by bad direction,3

28 October 2013,It could not get any better than this...!!!,After hearing so much about this movie I decided to check it out I was not disappointed In fact this was way beyond my expectations My wife isn t a great fan of sci fi per say but this blew her mind too I watched this 3 times already What I liked most about this movie is it s whole setup Almost shot entirely out of space this gripping thriller keeps you on the edge Sandra Bullock is fantastic actress this proves so yet again Clooney s sense of humor gives you a good laugh or two Visualizations are fantastic and gives you feel of actual space I honestly don t know what could have made this any better So go on watch it if you haven t already I m planning for watching it again,9
2 November 2013,Outer or inner space?,Pieces of a space ship space litter hit this American station The astronauts are in danger because in cosmos you re very lonely How to survive That question has been put many times in film history It s in 3D but you can t say the film makers take much advantage of that Maybe it doesn t matter because the drama is more about what happens inside Sandra Bullock She meets different space cultures Russian and Chinese and there are collisions It seems to be quite easy making space emptiness the base of dramatic events Perhaps a little too easy Anyway the universe moves on with us or without us,7
5 November 2013,Visually stunning and absolutely breath-taking!,Can t beat the view astronaut Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney says and he s right Directed by Alfonso Cuaron Harry Potter 3 Gravity is about two astronauts Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski who are servicing the Hubble Space Telescope until debris from a Russian missile strike on a nearby inoperative satellite causes them to abort the mission However the debris practically destroys the space shuttle knocking out all communications with mission control and sending Stone and Kowalski spiraling into space with nothing but a tether holding the two of them together This results in the two astronauts to struggle for survival with nothing but each other in what is one of the scariest and most dangerous situations ever Again Can t beat the view The visual effects in Gravity are GORGEOUS Some of the best effects I have ever seen in all of film Its one thing to have incredible effects in a movie but its another to have them immerse you in the story That is what Gravity does You feel as though you are in space with these guys and are struggling with them At one point when both Stone and Kowalski are low on oxygen I found myself inhaling the same time they were This film is breath taking I have no idea how this movie was made Opening with a 12 minute long one cut sequence of the camera just floating around seems unbelievable Not to mention the attention to detail with everything floating is very impressive The one criticism I have for this movie is the script because at times it seemed some things Clooney s character was saying seemed unrealistic but the writing and dialogue is not what you look for in a movie like this This movie is an experience and one of the coolest I have ever had in a theater Which brings me to my next point SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS Do not wait 6 and a half months for netflix or redbox or whatever you do see it in theaters This movie was not meant to be watched on a little phone in a subway Even though the entire movie is just with two people you never get bored and you will be on the edge of your seat Clooney gives a solid performance and Bullock gives her best performance since The Blind Side,9
26 October 2013,This movie is absolutely awesome.first thing is you need to watch it imax 3D.,This movie is absolutely awesome first thing is you need to watch it imax 3D From the get go to the end of the movie will not even turn your head the direction and background is awesome This movie is all about a lady scientist missed in the space due to some aircraft crash and how she reaches to the earth from space every time she tries to survive there will be a twist like some fire accident some destruction etc and by overcoming all these how she reaches to the earth coming to action part sandra was exceptionally awesome though george clooney was for some time his performance is good with some cool comedy great thing is you would expect Oscar wining director and producer from this movie,10
31 January 2014,Sandra Bullock's Masterclass,This film was amazing in it s visuals and it s ground breaking CGI But one thing that stood out to me was the incredible performance by Bullock She was simply mesmerising This film has the entertainment we all want to see when watching a space movie It also has layers of depth not seen in many blockbusters nowadays The themes of rebirth and sorrow are hammered home in a visually stunning way However the most incredible thing about the film was Bullock She impressed me in every way One scene in particular stands out all I will say is that there was some barking involved George Clooney was also great despite his short screen time Overall I think this was a highly entertaining flick which is technologically and emotionally incredible And did I mention how GREAT SANDRA BULLOCK WAS,9
2 November 2013,"A movie to see on big screens, for sure.",Gravity is the masterpiece everybody promised me We re immersed in space after the first minutes through incredible technological qualities We discover at first some friendly characters whom gradually become more and more human to slowly get into the skin of the character of Sandra Bullock We re receiving her feelings her fears we understand her reactions The fact that there is no pause or flash back in the movie is revolutionary Some scenes are extremely long that s what Cuar n wanted It gives more realism to the situations and let us time to understand the psychological aspects And finally a movie reconciling me with 3D Without doing too much with unnecessary effects there is just what we need to fulfill the function that 3D should fulfill in every movie feel ourselves further into a movie That being said I can t wait to see Gravity at home and feel a little bit nervous about what it ll be on a small screen,9
8 October 2013,should have been a documentary,this could have been aired as a documentary on what do do when you are stuck in space It is understandable why the movie was only 91 minutes long as the story line was a single event not enough of a story to hold my interest the view of earth was nondescript so what one is left with is the science of gravity and things floating in space while those flying objects were fun to watch they merely ended up nowhere as all one could see in this film was SPACE and did i mention that it was 91 minutes of SPACE had i not viewed this film in 3D on the big screen I am certain it would have been a bore though I would have watched it to the end just to see its conclusion not disappointed that i saw the movie just not sure what all the hype was about I felt like a judge on the Voice waiting for someone to hit the high note that never came I would never want to see this film in 2D nor would I ever need to see this film again While I am not saying the fierce dilemma that became the characters motivation in this film was a who cares situation but really I didn t feel the character development allowed me to care all that much,7
7 October 2017,The script sucks but I still love this movie,I ve seen this movie like 10 times while it was screened in nearby 3D cinema I wish there is no cheap tricks in the script I wish there is no Clooney nor Bullock in the cast as they are not adding any value and for me they somehow do the opposite ruining the experience with their wooden acting But what I absolutely fancy in this movie is the space and how it is shown Total silence and the amazing mesmerizing views If you dive then you may know what I am talking about but that s still perhaps 10 of what you experience up there yes I wish I could do space dive before I am gone To sum up watch the movie Pay less attention to the story but enjoy the space experience If you can have it in 3D the absolutely go for it,9
17 June 2018,Rubbish,Only one word describes this film RUBBISH The story is dull and the film is just plain boring Don t listen to critics This is one of the worst films i have ever watched,1
18 August 2016,"Visually spectacular, plus the script is very weak .",Gravity is a science fiction film that I was eager to watch at the good cast even limited with only 2 players and because the critics were very positive but I do not found all this more is a cool movie starting with the special effects are incredible the look is something spectacular you get hypnotized by the details of space and Planete Earth so technically the film is perfect plus the script is one of weakness movies just the script does not exist have nothing else besides being good liar something that would be impossible to happen the performance of Sandra Bullock is great Clooney is well plus it does not appear so the last minutes of the film are very tense the soundtrack is reasonable and the direction of Alfonso Cuaron is good most do not know if he deserved the Oscar Gravity is visually flawless more is weak in the script and has a slow pace Note 7 2,7

20 September 2020,A cinematically stunning poor film.,The visuals special FX direction and cinematography in this film are truly outstanding and worthy of its awards However the story and characters are sadly painfully weak A film full of cliches and embarrassingly narcissistic performances from its cast of two I m all for a bit of science fiction fantasy but this film just had me thinking as if from start to finish and by the end I felt intellectually insulted I d have rated it lower if not for the amazing visuals and direction Disappointing with so much potential,2

25 August 2014,A treat for all the senses.,As I m not an expert in any form of physics or aerospace engineering I can t comment on how ridiculous the plot or plot holes may may not be With suspension of disbelief and allowing yourself to accept the movie as realistic it becomes an intense movie especially in 3D I especially appreciate the hard work that goes into creating a film with this level of CGI The film is beautifully crafted with superb acting and life like visuals In 3D you get a better feel for the movie and the audience is transported to the empty vacuum of space with the cast The movie does however require the dedicated attention of the audience at all times Gravity avoids exposition and instead relies on visual imagery usually in the form of text seen on dials or displays to explain what is happening usually these important details are only on screen for one or two seconds and are very easy to miss if the audience doesn t read them fast enough This is made even harder in 3D as the text will often have some blur or minor distortion,9
28 March 2020,"The visuals are nice, but you'll be too bored to care",With all of the budget going to the visual effects and the two actors there was no money left for a writer to provide a script or dialogue Boring and annoyingly unrealistic How did this get such a high rating,1
11 May 2021,Probably the one with the closest to the actual universe of all movies portraying it,A plot is very simple and maybe expectable and it looks deficient to fill full 2 hours Dr Ryan Stone is marooned in the whole wide universe all alone and she tries to find her way home A little bit sound like clich Maybe However the visual effects and research put into the spaceship upgrade the movie I watched the documentary on NASA s training and technology for space shuttle and space station and Gravity s resemblance to the real life model and training increases the sense of virtuality In addition to magical but very realistic portrayal of the space and the Earth with visual effects as a backdrop detailed and researched spaceship and actors following the manual of evacuation bring more verisimilitude to audience Finally camera walk and angle bring more movement flow and point of view so it really feels as I m floating with Dr Stone in the Soyuz spacecraft or out in the space What takes this film to the next level is how it carries out and presents the theme the beginning and the birth Universe is where all things started formed were discovered Images and scenes implicating the theme appear frequently but very beautifully For example when Dr Stone finally settles in at Soyuz after her oxygen almost runs out she rests by crouching her back and her chest meeting her legs Lights are not on her but rather coming from behind very dimly and all the cords in the background indicate umbilical cord Also when she lands on the ground at last she struggles to stand up just like a new born animal or human at the very beginning of the ages Because of this recurrent theme it is inevitable for Dr Stone to choose life,8
5 May 2023,"Looks Great, Sounds A Little Less So",Gravity does a great job of providing the viewer a glimpse into outer space and the immense power that comes from the great void that exists in a world where there is nothing to carry sound no air pressure and no oxygen Its awe inspiring and more that a little scary However the story that supports the special effects is disappointing and lets things down George Clooney does a nice job here but there isn t really all that much in the Sandra Bullock character though Gravity is interesting and visually unique and despite some serious shortcomings in the script it is still worth checking out of your curious,6
20 December 2019,A triumph of pixels over point,The premise of this film is totally ridiculous The back stories and love interest are manipulative and contrived The laws of physics are blatantly ignored And yet the computer graphics if not the sound effects are impressive Maybe on the big screen it s possible to sit back be wowed by the whizz and overlook the gaping black holes in this film,3
9 March 2021,Overall great film!,This movie will give you an experience that not many movies can give you as the visual effects are just glorious The film was very well directed and cinematography and visual effects were just astounding The only reason why I wouldn t give this movie 10 10 is the same reason for the Martian I felt that some of the side characters could be used more,9
24 November 2013,A minimalistic piece of cinematic beauty,Gravity is a perfect example of how special effects can be used in an extraordinarily clever fashion to enhance the story instead of trying to tell it This very minimalistic movie with only two characters on screen is visually stunning It follows the aftermath of a space shuttle being hit by debris which leaves two astronauts adrift in space with all the odds against them Space with its vastness unpredictability and empty silence becomes a character all in its own as our protagonists try to survive That s when the special effects create a fantastic wondrous world that captures the audience as it lays trap after trap for Ryan and Michael played wonderfully subdued by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Especially the former who totally plays against type and succeeds You re never at ease you never what know what s coming what s true or what s an illusion and I don t think you ll ever feel the same about going into space The short running time the tension build up the intensity and the for me very satisfying ending make this a movie that you really shouldn t miss it is a unique and beautiful piece of cinematic art Movies which generate this kind of hype usually draw a lot of regular movie goers while driving away those with a more sophisticated taste This time I m pretty sure neither group will be unhappy,8
5 November 2013,Gravity: A Nerve-Wrecking Masterpiece by Director Alfonso Cuarón.,Space has always been an interesting setting for films It takes the characters into the unknown promising to put them in immediate danger Anything could go wrong and most of their resources and equipment must stay untouched and in perfect working condition if they want to survive and touch Earth again However most of these films add to that danger by providing creatures a mission which is extra dangerous or making other humans within the setting a threat Gravity is special It does not use any of the previously three described cases and instead puts the characters in mortal danger by a simple yet very plausible scenario Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer who has been contracted by NASA to create and install a prototype machine and computer which will provide further data to their investigations She is accompanied by astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney and two other astronauts Within the first few minutes we see them working on the satellite which will hold Dr Ryan s machine and computer 2 minutes later the team is informed that Russia has destroyed one of their satellites with a missile possibly to avoid any of their information in the satellite from being leaked if the pieces of it land on Earth Seconds later the debris of the destroyed satellite is flying by them some of it hits their ship and satellite and Dr Ryan Stone is sent into the void when her tether breaks with nothing but her space suit and working tools All this happens within the first 10 minutes It sounds dangerous but it is nothing like watching it on the big screen and hearing it greatly aided by 3D All hell breaks lose around them Everything turns to chaos in a few seconds and soon Dr Ryan has lost contact with everyone and finds herself spinning and floating in endless space A few minutes later of panicking and hyperventilating from both the audience and Ryan Matt makes contact with her For the next hour or so we watch them in torturous suspense attempt to return to Earth safely After the first 7 minutes the whole movie is one edge of your seat ride In the whole movie there are only a couple of scenes which slow down provided to let the audience breath for a few seconds before the characters are thrown in mortal and unforgiven danger once more All this is aided by phenomenal special effects We never doubt that Matt and Ryan are floating in zero gravity or that a slight change in their momentum will either save them or kill them The score does the same It makes us feel more tense or sad depending on the scene and the sound is aggressive and precise The 3D is greatly immersive It only pulls you into space and makes everything look more real and dangerous Sandra Bullock s performance is great We never see anyone other than isolated Dr Ryan Stone in Sandra Bullock s body It is amazing to understand that for close to 80 of the film she is in front of nothing but a green screen for the special effects but it is never noticeable She carries the bulk of the movie and she does so smoothly and naturally as if she was actually there in space trying to survive and get back to Earth alive All in all a great space suspense thriller,10
8 January 2014,A bad movie being sold as a masterpiece...,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
12 November 2013,Outstanding,I watched this movie in 3D with very open mind as i haven t seen its trailer before watching it This movie is best cinematic experience i have had after Avatar seriously i don t prefer to watch movies in 3d but this movie have some serious 3d effect During the whole movie I was sitting on the edge on my seat definitely worth every penny watching it in cinema Loved it The music the cinematography the effects all were just out of this world This movie easily tops in to one of my favourite top 10 movies of all time,10

6 October 2013,"One of the best science fiction films not just in years, but of all time",Gravity Directed By Alfonso Cuaron Written By Alfonso Cuaron and Jonas Cuaron Starring Sandra Bullock George Clooney The beauty of it all the Earth from space is the opening shot of visionary director Alfonso Cuaron s Gravity which could describe the film in its own right This film is the best of 2013 so far and quite possibly one of the best science fiction films of all time I have seen no other film like it and don t think I ever will The story follows Dr Ryan Stone a brilliant astronaut on her first voyage to space played by Sandra Bullock in the best performance of her career Dr Stone and her colleague veteran astronaut Lt Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney with plenty of charm and lots of focus are stranded in space when space debris comes in contact with their spacecraft I won t reveal any other further elements of the plot because it isn t worth ruining This film is so absolutely well written that it is all unpredictable It deserves to be a surprise An average moviegoer would go in thinking that it s a stupid concept and asking his or herself how they could make a full film out of it Well Cuaron succeeded in creating one of the most intense mesmerizing and breathtaking 90 minutes in all of cinema history Bullock is a tour de force as Stone and plays her with such humanity and power that you are rooting for her throughout all of this king of underdog stories Clooney is full of wit and control as Kowalski truly perfect for his role The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is beyond gorgeous working in long continuous shots the first shot is nearly 15 minutes long Steven Price s score is one of the best in years and should prove himself with this film as one of the next great talents in film music The effects mostly computer generated should win all the awards because they look shockingly real compared to most films The techniques invented for this film work astoundingly well for simulating near perfect if not perfect zero gravity movement This is also the single best use of 3D ever in a motion picture It is worth all the extra money too see it in 3D and on the biggest screen possible in most cases IMAX The scientific accuracy and attention to detail are phenomenal aspects of the realism When the debris hits there is no sound which makes it all the more horrifying and isolated in feeling and you can only hear from Stone s perspective and the score throughout the entire film This is also one of the most completely terrifying films I ve seen scarier than most horror films but it has one thing that horror films generally lack a sense of hope All of it is wrapped up in the final shot the struggle and plight of Stone the hope and will to survive that drove her a final shot and film that deserves a standing ovation Gravity is one of the single most incredible cinematic experiences to date and every man woman and child should see it for that reason,10
20 July 2018,Terrifying,I have never seen a film that made space so terrifying,8
13 March 2019,Sandra Bullock,This film is great for a film that sticks you in a box with Sandra bullock for most of the duration It will make you feel everything she endures both the pain and the relief,8
5 October 2013,Innovative Thriller A Must-see,Alfonso Cuaron does it yet again After Children of Men I had high expectations for this film I was worried that the trailer would fully summarize the film but there is a lot to experience by watching the entire film I would certainly classify this as a thriller because space is a scary place With good use of sound or lack thereof camera angles and cinematography this movie deserves a solid 7 10 Though the movie is intended to make the audience feel alone and isolated I still wish that the cast was larger or at least more developed Other than that I saw no issues with this movie I keep thinking of In space no one can hear you scream If Alien had not used this tag line first I think it would have been fitting for this one,7
17 December 2019,Who in the hell thought this was a good movie?,Probably one of the worst and non exciting movies I ve ever seen They should just name it she destroys the ISS,2
15 October 2013,A magnificent vivid portrayal of the perils in a world without gravity,I walked into Gravity with high hopes and it delivered The only previous work by the director I m familiar with is Great expectations which is a movie which will stay with me forever being a mature and coming of age piece of cinema for me Gravity however is futuristic captivating and a thrilling ride of a film delving into a dimension and accomplishing successfully what only greats like Stanley Kubrick did with 2001 A space odyssey Ron Howard with the masterful Apollo 13 and and Ridley Scott with Alien There is a tension in space a fear of the unknown which only few artists have encapsulated in their works over the years It is not just about protagonists battling antagonists but the triumph of one over oneself braving odds and emerging champion Gravity s story develops well as it explains how Russians have the right to dispensation of defunct spy satellites One such missile strike chains a reaction of destruction of existing satellites imperilling the lives of astronauts with debris hurled at them at high speeds revolving in orbit Sandra bullock outshines in her performance as a doctor on a space mission gone defective as she drifts marooned confronting and overcoming unending space hazards Her emotional turmoil is captured in astounding manner and one which propels the movie George clooney s performance is an excellent one delivering comic timing and uplifting the mood of the film empowering Sandra bullock and ensuring she survives the trauma and perils of the space catastrophe all on her own Some facts satellite details and their use Russian and Chinese orbiters might be scientifically arguable but it s certainly not a shot in the dark If not delved into in detail one would say the technical aspects and display use of equipments is credible Gravity is one of the best movies of 2013 and one of my favorites alongside Elysium Oblivion and Pacific Rim It is an very real and terrifying vision of survival in a world void of gravity It has been critically acclaimed and rightly so Highly recommended Don t miss out,10
12 December 2019,Floating Home,Right out of the gate let me say that there s really not much you can do with a story like this Script Unless you want your audience to ignore the zillion dollar effects don t worry too much about it Stranded in space Find a way to get home however you can It s supposed to be one of the great film premises and it always works It works here Bullock and Clooney do just what s needed and Bullock s character takes center stage for most of the film It was definitely worth watching and yes a lot of it was definitely suspension of disbelief but what is a film like this without those nick of the moment scenes where disaster is averted Bullock s desperation to get home definitely drives these moments nicely The whole struggle of moving around properly with zero gravity is displayed nicely too Clooney s devil may care fighter pilot attitude works well here Twelve Years a Slave won best picture that year and this film is no competition for that masterpiece The effects and cinematography were so superb that it really took the project to the top It held my interest even if I had to wait through the slow parts This film is not as bad as some say and not spectacular either as some others say Worth seeing for sure,7
16 January 2021,Worst movie ever,I can t remember to have ever seen a movie at this level Images of the space and the earth are the best part of this movie And everything else is crap The first ten minutes I hoped it would get a little more realistic It doesn t It s more a caricature of science fiction Really don t understand that there would be anyone who ll enjoy this movie Don t waste your 90 minutes on this one Life is too short,1
20 August 2016,A Soulful Space Thriller,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
23 October 2013,Like an amusement park ride - Spoilers...,I must have seen a different Gravity starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock than everybody else saw There are some great SFX but there is absolutely no story and so many holes it was hard to get through I compare this film to an amusement park ride Plenty of thrills and close calls but absolutely no substance and when it s over it s over I won t bother with the improbabilities in the film but if you are a thinking person it will be hard for your to get past them From a story perspective we are expected to believe that although every other astronaut in history trains for decades NASA let a woman who took a crash course in space exploration travel with a crew to repair some equipment Not only did they let her go on the mission somehow she has the capacity to navigate a space craft back to earth In just a few months of training I could barely solo a Cessna 172 and I am quite capable,5
24 April 2014,Visually Mind-Blowing,After winning seven Oscars this year I couldn t wait to see what the buzz was surrounding Gravity It blew my mind It is engineered so well that everything about it is incredible The visuals are probably this film s most prominent feature given that the scenes of space and the Earth have been created almost entirely using CGI it is a breath taking and strangely immersive setting giving a real sense of emptiness that is heavily contrasted with the restricted space shuttle scenes Alfonso Cuaron truly deserved his Oscar for Best Achievement in Directing Running a close second is the acting Sandra Bullock and George Clooney hold the film entirely being the only two actors featured in it and that really adds something to the feeling of perpetual emptiness and solitude associated with space itself Bullock is the real star of the show here the simplistic but effective story centres on her and she portrays a vulnerable relatable character in this film incredibly convincingly and with many complex elements I ve seen a few other films that she has been in and I was impressed at her ability to really branch out in this film and offer such a strong performance George Clooney does well as Bullock s astronaut partner with a calming and authoritative character that is just as likable as Bullock s As I mentioned above the story itself is fairly simplistic although it offers a deep insight into the lives of Clooney and Bullock s characters but it s so effective almost giving the impression of time having no meaning out in space the pace of the film reminded me of Jim Jarmusch s wonderful Only Lovers Left Alive 2014 Gravity is visually stunning and beautifully acted keeping you on the edge of your seat and drawing you in to the fascinating unknown that is space Watch it in HD on a good size screen for a truly immersive and effective experience you won t be disappointed,10
1 December 2013,Must Be Watched In 3D,Wow Director Alfonso Cuaron s has really made the use of 3D into powerful theatrical tool This picture will really lose something crucial when viewed in 2D at home Obviously the film is entirely CGI d but from the opening scene Cuaron s use of the camera gives a sense of disorientation to the viewer The camera pans in and out and around the space station whizzing past the characters at odd angles It really gives a sense of being in space where things float by and dart around with uncontrollable trajectories The film is a total immersion into the vastness and unpredictability of space It is a great performance by Sandra Bullock who is largely the only person on camera throughout the film Clooney although billed as a joint lead is not really in the movie after the half way point Bullock gives a very convincing account of the terror panic resignation and determination of Dr Stone which is effectively displayed in various points via a concentration on the character s breathing The real co star in the film is Cuaron s CGI background which is equally breathtaking The plot is good but it does leave the viewer with a feeling of oh what next when things continue to go wrong although this just builds up the intensity The film is only 90 mins long so the action is really packed into a short timescale which adds to the anxiety it leaves on the audience This film was all about the spectacle for me The disorientation of the camera work and the eerie silences really conveyed the solitude of space throughout the movie Cuaron has raised the bar,9
24 June 2020,A terrible screenplay just about ruins a visually stunning movie.,I saw this in 3D during its theater run and was in awe of the effects On a second viewing I paid more attention to the story the flow of events details on how our heroes got through the ordeal Under scrutiny the whole thing falls apart a deus ex machina too many appears physics stops when most convenient to the story and intelligence is insulted one too many times A crucial scene has a flaw in physics that I let go accepting that any other scenario could have led to the same result so I deemed it forgivable But then so many other flaws large and small put holes in the plot big enough for a planet to pass through See it for a good performance from both stars and for the views Then go see Interstellar for a lesson on how this kind of movie should be made,3
25 September 2023,loved it,Gravity is a cinematic masterpiece that has me floating on a cloud of awe with my resounding 8 10 rating and I absolutely loved every moment of it Sandra Bullock s performance is nothing short of stellar immersing us in her character s harrowing journey through the cold expanse of space The film editing is a breathtaking dance of tension and release keeping me on the edge of my seat Its strength lies in its ability to convey the sheer isolation and vulnerability of the astronauts against the infinite void The music underscores the emotional depth of the story while the cinematography captures the majesty and terror of space in exquisite detail Gravity is not just a film it s a visceral experience that reminds us of our human tenacity in the face of the cosmos indifference I loved it to the stars and back,8
10 October 2013,"Amazing experience, brilliant direction, must watch movie",I had gone to watch the movie after that scene in the trailer where SB is falling in space with no strings attached That one really pushed me to watch Gravity and I am very happy that I did The movie is in all about 2 astronauts stuck in space after an incident Being stuck in space can be really really scary and that is what is shown in the movie The views are amazing the direction is breathtaking the background score plays as important a role as SB or GC Given that there is no sound in space the severity of most incidents is established by the music This is not science fiction The cinematography the camera angles are all phenomenal Also you will not be able to find any anomaly in the facts shown Like how the things should be in space without gravity If someone would have told me that Spielberg had made this movie I would have easily believed Must watch,9
6 May 2021,Hollywood movie in every sense,The big budget thriller is a double edged sword On one hand everything was expensive so it looks fantastic and if you think space is cool it s easy to get wrapped up in the awe inspiring special effects On the other hand it swings big every chance it gets resulting in a slew of unbelievably narrow escapes and unnecessary sentimentality Still a fun popcorn flick if you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride,7
20 July 2022,A major step forward,Technically Gravity is a masterpiece and fully deserves the Oscars it won in that area Plot wise well there really isn t much of a plot It s basically a 90 minute action sequence There s a couple of pauses for breath but the pace from beginning to end is hectic and this makes for a great veiwer experience George Clooney is perfect as the charming astronaut however I can t help but think he s a little old for the part However we need to talk about Sandra Bullock or more specifically we need to talk about her face She s had so much work done that her face may as well be a mask at this stage Being unable to express emotion through facial expressions should be a big problem for an actor not that Bullock was ever a great actor It s a major problem here as she is in every single scene and has to basically carry the movie single handed,7

26 February 2014,very bad story only a few good CG,this is one of the worst movies ever and I am sure about that since i have watched 2000 movies in my life The whole film is talking about how Sandra is a noob and how George saves her ass The only good thing about the movie is the CG but it only contains earth debris and two space station I don t see how the rubbish story could earn this movie a good reputation it is so boring that my friends and I fell asleep in the theater The effort to make the story interesting is zero How does it deserve an Oscar Deep moral implication of how a women feel when being left alone in space Seriously this movie simply boring and dull the lines are stupid and the main character is stupid,1
11 November 2013,Be on edge of your seat !!,I was trying to get the tickets on very weekend Finally got a chance and time to watch this splendid movie The real essence of this movie can only be felt in 3D cinema halls As expected after reading reviews and ratings on different portals the movie lived up to its expectations The cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki is majestic Attention has been given to minute details and it gives a great feeling of actually how it feels in space I thrilled whenever camera switched to First person view Sometimes i felt myself into that situation and how i would have reacted The performance of Sandra Bullock is awesome I liked her anxiety those nervous feeling while being in that situation The hard work of Alfonso Cuar n is clearly visible This movie is 1st of this kind and is superb I had a wonderful 90 minutes,9
12 October 2020,A film CGI was made for is a visual and dramatic spectacle,Working on the exterior of their space shuttle flying debris from a destroyed satellite kills a crew member and fatally damages the shuttle A space scientist Sandra Bullock is on her first mission With the help of another survivor an experienced astronaut George Clooney they cling on to debris outside the Earth s atmosphere and must find a way to escape their terrifying situation Other than a few moments of calm and serenity this disaster in space movie rather than sci fi is a roller coaster ride until the very end An extraordinary immersive experience that shows objects silently disintegrating and exploding soundlessly in space This is a rare example of CGI being used well and the sense of isolation and a situation that seems impossible to escape from is well expressed Well handled by director Cuar n who also co produced co wrote and co edited There are some coincidences such as the number of space stations close to each other that stretches believability but otherwise strong drama,10
10 December 2013,Highly derivative,Visually stunning almost completely throughout I found this film hardly worth watching a first time Aside from the scenes with both Clooney and Bullock the storytelling is non existent This movie was produced to deliver stunning visuals but was 100 lacking in script and character development What we have here is 20 minutes of movie and 70 minutes of filler My suggestion is to turn off the audio and treat this film like a screen saver I give this 5 points for visuals cinematography 0 points for writing and 1 point for casting two Academy Award winners,6

28 February 2014,Geeky Randy's summary,To the point and dull free tale of astronaut Bullock trying to make her way back to Earth safely after an accidental mid orbit destruction of a shuttle leaves her stranded in outer space Effects driven but what space odyssey isn t but charmingly simplistic when it all comes right down to it with a story and cast that makes it worth your while Maybe striving for a protagonist slightly more theatrical would remedy the film s interchangeable choice of casting though all the actors involved do an undeniably satisfying job Kudos for being a 3D film that has just as much appeal in 2D Worth seeing out of four,7

12 January 2014,radio drama plastered over some amazing images,Movie going is no cheap thrills today especially if you consider ticket prices Therefore the average viewer myself included wants to get his money worth and see some extraordinary images preferably in 3D There were attempts to couple this with what would be considered a powerful story for example The Tree of Life 2011 and Life of Pi 2012 This time the producers pulled out a story that would resonate with the broadest audience possible and employed everyone s darlings Sandra Bullock and George Clooney And this works for a while since the protagonists are not encountering zombies dragons or other mythical creatures but are astronauts fighting for their lives However at a certain point you start questioning the probability if not the physics of the things you see in Gravity In order to add to realism sound is mostly unheard but their is music to highlight the emotions which in turn reminded me of radio dramas i ve heard years ago Both Bullock and Clooney offer their standard performance I only hope that real astronauts have more mental stability and better training than Bullock s character in the movie,5
20 February 2022,Even with no gravity it still has weight,Space Shuttle Explorer Led by astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney is in Earth orbit to service the Hubble Space Telescope Joined by Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock on her first space mission to perform upgrades when suddenly the Explorer s hit by a shower space debris destroy it and send both Kowalski and stone flying And now with limited oxygen and resources left the two have to work together to live and make it home Gravity is one those film that it greatest moment come from show don t tell The movie is an overall appealing both visuality and dramatically It seem like it just paces itself just right every monet isn t a fast paced heart racing moment It s quiet and it lets the feeling of silence and isolation sink in It s would feel rather empty per say if it wasn t for both performances of George and Sandra The movie is completely center on this two because it just them for the whole movie their literally trapped up here by themselves However their opposite personalities really makes connection between them Sandra is what honestly everybody in that situation would be like she freaking use all her oxygen and is scared A lot of close up of the face are used in this putting you right is the characters faces you really feel the emotional going through her As for george he s funny all l laid back and professional about the whole situation which does make sense because he s been up here so much He know you got to take easy and stay calm He actually really important for Sandra becoming stronger and will to keep going Your rooting for her and fell the tension The soundtrack is also great and the visual are great looking down to the beauty of the earth where just around you is this cold void of death,7

13 April 2021,Worst movie last 3 years!!!!,We re in 2021 since 2017 I ve never seen a worse movie than this stupid graphics bad plot and the worst thing was the acting I cringed a lot man It s just disgusting,1
23 March 2014,Hugely overrated...,Gawd can I write 10 lines of text about this silly movie I sure wanted to set the record straight but 10 lines I don t quite understand all the praise dedicated to this movie Sure it has fantastic cgi which is why i gave it 5 stars but that s about it The script and dialogue are crap and a huge let down Is that how astronauts talk and behave like Highly unlikely And the never ending progression of debris hailing upon our poor protagonists and triggering an impossibly increasing domino effect of again never ending mayhem and destruction It should have been called Un gravity since the lack of gravity is the main protagonist here and taken to hollywoodian extremes Cant these people write a good believable script anymore Or is the American public so brainwashed that only bullshit scripts work Seems to be the case with most Hollywood productions these days Disappointing Enough dribble,5
12 September 2020,Very good,Today dawn I started watching the movie Gravidade 2013 I quite liked the film depicting an accident despite NASA pointed out the film directed by Cuar n as one of the worst films ever made on space When she comes out of the space suit she s wearing her super cute panties but where s the diaper says one of the scientists referring to the adult superabsorbent diaper used by all astronauts in space to subtract the need to take off their clothes to do their needs Despite this reported does not take away the merit of the director wanted to pass in the film Film seen on September 12 2020,8
8 November 2013,"If you only ever see one 3D film, SEE THIS ONE!",As a self confessed non fan of 3D I was annoyed that Gravity was only showing in 3D when I wanted to go to the cinema yesterday evening I ve never really been a big fan of 3D and most of the time came out of viewings thinking I paid how much extra to watch a dimmer picture of 1 scene with extra depth THIS FILM HOWEVER CHANGES ALL THAT OK the viewing experience is still dimmed due to the glasses but that is the ONLY negative point The sense of depth throughout the WHOLE film was A MAAAAY zing Visually stunning a true sense of space and the emotions it can create given certain situations Amazing sound design score I ve sat at work this morning with headphones on listening to the Gravity OST Holy Cow I was right back in the thick of it Awesome The story is simple yet effective draws you right in and really makes you care about the characters almost in a documentary style SEE IT you won t regret it Oh and once you re in your seat like the tag line says Don t Let Go 0 10 10,10
12 March 2014,Hollywood garbage,This movie is full of lame clich s poor dialog and a pathetic storyline The ONLY thing that makes this movie remotely watchable are the special effects Firstly the story line is total garbage and unoriginal As usual the whole fiasco was the fault of the Russians Seriously Haven t we moved passed the cold war and the whole evil Russian empire Then we have the main character Sandra Bullock Here we have another sad clich as she plays a woman with scars and a tear jerking past who is trying to find meaning and redemption in her sad and empty life out in the depths of space Awwwwww George Clooney plays the standard heroic all American good guy who is totally fearless selfless and willing to give the ultimate sacrifice all with a sense of humor makes me wish i was an American sarcasm Secondly we have the story which is so unbelievable that it defies logic and Sandra Bullocks character is the most gifted most intelligent and luckiest person in the history of humanity as she survives one unbelievable catastrophe after another Not too bad for an underdog who flunked her flight simulations and has virtually no skills as an astronaut Seriously this film is an insult to your intelligence and it seems to be marketed to people who believe and fairy tales and unicorns,1
5 October 2013,One Word: Breathtaking,I had the pleasure of seeing this movie on opening night It was absolutely astonishing from start to finish Visually stunning mind bendingly realistic and an all around adrenaline rush My only complaint is that it seemed to be over too quickly Which can be both good and bad Good because it was the perfect length Bad because I didn t want it to be over Seriously all in all this is probably the best space movie I have ever seen If you haven t gathered it by now I HIGHLY recommend this film One of the best films I ve seen all year But be warned this film will suck you in the second the opening title leaves the screen If it s not the incredible acting that does it it s the jaw dropping and stunning visuals If you do go see Gravity you really should I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did,9

12 February 2014,Does it count as a story?,Honestly I don t understand all the perfect reviews praising the movie If what I saw had a story then it was a very bad one 1 If you are going to make a movie with a setting in the space shouldn t you at least follow the laws of physics Newton s laws of motion I understand that it is fictional however in order to make it believable shouldn t it convince the audience me that the characters were struggling in the space There were so many errors and I don t even think the whole movie can happen 2 I didn t find it visually stunning and I guess it was my fault to watch it in 2D When did movies require 3D to be enjoyable A good story makes a good movie and CGI is merely an accessory to story telling What did I learn from the movie Let s see you don t have to know things can be over emotional in situations and all you need is lucks to survive YAWN,1
18 October 2013,The greatest space masterpiece of all time!!!!,I don t know how to say what I just saw except for I was watching the greatest space film I have ever seen I don t care about the others because this amazing movie has finally won me back to realizing great movies are still around Don t hesitate to see this movie It is jaw dropping and remarkable to a level that we may never see again So many times you are left speechless and gripping to the characters throughout the film So many real and vivid images that you are in awe of everything From beginning to end Gravity is on a whole new level and I don t see anyone coming close to it s work for a very long time Maybe even decades before we see something so beautiful and terrifying at the same time,10
26 January 2014,Gratifying,Wow what an emotional ride Right out the gate this movie is intense At first the beginning of the movie is mostly what was shown in the previews and once that episode is over for me I was thinking How are they going to stretch this into a 1 5 hr movie Well they did and it was intense the entire way At first it reminded me of movies like Buried or I Am Legend Not much interaction with other characters just solitude and thoughts from the performer and I believe that s what makes the emotional connection stronger to the actor performing because deep down you are going through what they are and you inexplicably want to do something anything to help in their endeavor but all you can do is watch and hope they make it through whatever perils lay ahead With top entertainers such as George Clooney and Sandra Bullock who I love it s no wonder this movie was popular and greatly talked about after initial release I don t get the luxury of opening nights anymore My only regret is not having the opportunity to watch it in 3 D I heard this is a movie actually enhanced not just gimmicks by 3 D Just watching it in 2 D I could tell some events would give off more of a reaction from the added dimension So if you haven t yet seen this movie I highly recommend it,8
24 November 2013,Realistic and stunning visuals,If you are scientifically orientated and ever watched the usual space movies you might be bothered by the often inaccurate portrayal of the physics that govern the vast void I have to admit I felt that way when watching the protagonists fly their ship at the speed of light in the Star Wars movies even though I liked those movies and am not exceptionally educated in natural sciences This movie is of course nothing of that sort It contains nothing magical that couldn t happen in the real world Without giving anything away Gravity is a movie about surviving in extreme conditions and to a lesser extent about portraying the motive one has to carry on despite overwhelming odds against one It features impressive visuals best experienced in a movie theater preferably 3D That said it s well worth watching and the excitement you ll receive will be greater than the feeling of getting ripped off by the expensive movie tickets I would however have wished for a deeper pondering about the motives of hope a human being has amidst a seemingly hopeless situation I found the real motives of the protagonists to stay alive too superficial but if you are more into core action then this movie will seem almost flawless,

4 September 2020,It's a one hell of a ride either way; life or death,What worked The movie is visually and audibly phenomenal making it an interesting watch I must say it is not easy to execute this project an idea that is so necessary to be told The movie is thrilling and engaging most of its parts It s a one person show mainly so making it a challenge and an opportunity to give us an individual experience as much as you taking the ride yourself in the space The entire team especially cinematography editing sound mixing and editing need special praise along with the direction The movie I think intends to give us a perspective of life lost humanity life death and the earth and I think it was successful for the most part What did not work Also a challenge the movie had a linear and a simple screenplay making it risky to be boring and superficial lacking depth Somehow we could have expected the screenplay to be more lively and humane Having said that we should also acknowledge the intend and the jest of the movie I am not trying to be biased but I would have preferred any other actors than Sandra Bullock for the role not that she did not act well but i think we do have options of other actress for this roles Final verdict recommended,8
17 November 2013,Great experience but conventionnal survival movie,Within the first instants one is sucked in by the immensity of space The immersion is total thanks to the 3D which undeniably brings something extra in certain scenes though this technology is still quite perfectible and the soundtrack which is in complete harmony with the action though sometimes more silence would have been appreciated Therefore if you consider the movie as an experience as it should be it s great especially at the beginning when it s totally captivating because for the rest it is a classic survival movie with very conventional developments that sometimes even relies on some cringe worthy typical Hollywood style melodramatic clich s All in all Gravity is a unique experience a great slap to the face but it hardly qualifies for the masterpiece rank a lot of people are crediting it,7
13 November 2013,Lower your expectations,I was reading the bad reviews There are allot of people whom hold the belief they are really clever You will hear comments like Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation She is a scientist sent in space for a single scientific mission We do this currently These objects just don t orbit anywhere ANYWHERE near close enough to each other to make these events even remotely possible You are right as we currently don t have the next generation shuttle and the Chinese don t have a space station yet so yeah they don t orbit close enough since they are not yet real You gifted child you No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a few seconds of reading the manuals The soyuz capsule is currently an emergency reentry vehicle on board the International Space Station astronauts are trained on it even scientists who are not expected to use it It is pointed out in the movie The pilot would be the mission commander forget it yeah she learned to fly from the manual you are a clever little What happened to Clooney character Is he waiting to appear in the sequel if the film succeeds What are you serious The whole emotional power of what happened to him comes from the fact that you know without seeing it The Chinese craft was already heading toward earth how Its not a craft but a space station in a stable orbit around earth balanced between its inertia around the earth and the pull of our planets gravity The station was loosing its orbit after the collision ohhh just forget it it was magic Lower your expectations stop watching movie trailers and enjoy a solid movie,10
7 February 2014,There should be refund policy for movies too,First of all watch this movie on your own risk After watching this movie i realize that there should be refund policies for movies like these I don t know about people who have written good review about this film i think they might have been retard or they have seen some other movie instead of this crap I don t get it how does three writers manage to write a garbage like this When i went for this movie i thought this will be a good value for money but man i was so wrong i just want 90 min of my life back I just left the movie theater angry i cant think of the last time when this happened to me this movie is not only waste of money waste of time but BORING till the extent that next time before going to any movie you will think 100 times,2

27 January 2014,Techinically brilliant..... but lacks the emotional depth......,With the recent Oscar nomination march on I watched Gravity with a high expectation And after watching it thought it would have been better had I watched it in 3D What happens when you are adrift in the outer space without gravity is what the film s plot is about And with the space suits on Sandra Bullock as a medical engineer and George Clooney as a veteran astronaut take us to the journey outside the space which highlights the technical brilliance in movie making You get stunned and Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as usual enlivens the film through their screen presence But beyond that the film appears a bit empty lacking the emotional depth or depth in characters In the aspect I liked Apollo 13 which documented an important event form the space history In Gravity the story somehow resembles the adrift journey of Wall E You would surely be mesmerized by its sheer expertise in the visuals but in terms of story and characters the film ends inadequate and to me The Life of Pi was better Overall the film ends pretty well technically but I highly doubt about its probability for getting through Oscars in the popular awards Rating 2 stars out of 4,6
18 September 2022,A CLASSIC CUARON FILM,I can honestly say that this was one of the best contemporary sci fi films I have watched The visual effects and production design was top tier It was as realistic as it gets The plot really took its time to establish the importance of each and every one of the scenes The result was a beautifully made movie about space survival that was emotionally and psychologically relevant Sandra Bullock s performance was on point as usual It was one of those films that takes you on a journey the way it creates an ambiance which was out of this world and bring you into a dimension like any other space films,6
24 October 2013,The dark side of the moon...77.5%,This is a highly unusual film to come out of America and be on mainstream release It s pretty much what a bad day at the office would like for astronauts and of course it s pretty bleak Hollywood names George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star as astronauts orbiting Earth on a space shuttle Disaster strikes Who will live Who will die Will anyone survive Bullock looks very unglamorous in this movie until she gets most of her gear off and then man is her next role as a world class athlete or gymnast or something Don t tell me that she went all method to play the part of an astronaut Um astronauts don t look so fit Not sure if I actually saw her bum could have sworn she had an anvil where her buttocks should be In favour of this movie is genuine tension as both the astronauts and their means of escape become endangered I watched this in 3D and I actually blinked a few times as debris hurtled towards me Bullock s character has the most fleshed out backstory unlike her buttocks which adds to the existential angst of the situation that they face and her will to survive One minor gripe I had about this film was during one scene where time is of the essence and Clooney s character is just very chatty with Bullock s character despite mentioning to her the urgency of time All the time he was talking to her and she wasn t actually heading where she should be going I kept thinking Seriously Come on MOVE IT There was an old scientific theory which posited that all of space was filled with aether maybe last year I browsed a scientific magazine which had some speculative science that something akin to the concept may be revived in Scientific American I don t remember and I just mention this to note the heavy use of symbolism in this movie The astronauts floating about in the aether look rather like foetuses floating in amniotic fluid with an umbilical cord There is an even more marked yet subtle image of Sandra s character floating inside a space station in a foetal position These kinds of images suggest that there is some kind of deeper parallel being made by the film Can t say that I put my finger on what it was if it does indeed exist I did wonder if maybe this was some kind of origin story for humanity implying that our species had its origins in outer space and came to colonise Earth which is actually a current hypothesis in physics I believe people like Pr Paul Davies I think believing that the seeds of life are present everywhere across the universe and so life may form wherever there is fertile ground to land on But then again maybe the symbolism in the movie is just nice imagery without such speculation going on Must also note how excellent the simulation of weightlessness in this movie is it looks real,8
7 October 2013,Suspense from the beginning until the end,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
13 October 2013,Brilliance in Cinema Making. Must Watch.,Gravity is one visually awesome thriller you should watch on the big screen owing to its brilliant cinematography and special effects transporting you to space Its posed to get nominations in multiple categories in upcoming Oscars With one of her best performances by Bullock a thrilling score and a feel as if the Director has shot the whole movie in deep dark space with hand held camera its going to amaze you in bounds There are movies which are worth a watch only on 3D After Avatar and Avengers Gravity is one such movie whose 3D effects play an integral and important part in its execution And George Clooney is George Clooney whose mere presence lights up the screen All in all a very technically sound movie with utmost care given to the minutest of the details It is highly recommended as its not a movie you see its an experience which the Director gives you,9
7 November 2013,The Most Visually Stunning Movie Ever !,I just saw Gravity in my local cinema and I am honestly blown away From the visual effects to the brilliant directing Gravity is brilliant The plot is Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are astronauts who are fixing a satellite in space Then a Russian Satellite is destroyed and it causes some problems and we have our movie My favourite thing about this movie is the directing Alfonso Cuaron take a bow The effects also power home This movie should definitely should win best effects and Best Director Another Great thing is that Sandra Bullock puts in the performance of her career as Ryan Stone Every scene feels real that she is an astronaut left stranded George Clooney is also great as Kowalski but not as good as Bullock Overall Gravity is a brilliant film with phenomenal effects and Directing I recommend it to everybody,10
17 January 2022,Minimalistic but moving story,Gravity tells a sparse story set in the time frame of one day and in pretty much one setting The hostile nature of space and a collision of distant events puts the pressure on one relatively inexperienced astronaut and her attempts to survive There s really only one theme here but it does hit home because of one moving moment in the film More of a personal journey than an epic space tale Gravity brings the emotions but also heavy hits of adrenaline,9
13 October 2013,"Riveting, Spectacular, Intense",State of art technology and excellent sound design Its not just a visual treat but much more lot of emotional pull as well Stellar performances by Bullock Clooney An Amazing watch Nobody should miss out this movie and Definitely watch it Especially enjoyed watching this 3D movie it felt as if one was part of Ryan s journey in the infinite space Clooney s character Matt in the movie plays significant part in Ryan s low moments The movie is sublime in all respects Its also about myriad of emotions that Ryan feels apart from the physical limitations and how through her experiences in space she discovers herself again Even after the last scene finished music which had a mystical touch to it started playing and people started moving out of theater I was till still sitting there soaking in the vastness of space and of humanity A must watch in 3D and on largest possible screen,9
6 October 2013,Best space epic since 2001,More than a generation distances Gravity from the film 2001 But between those two films all other space movies pale in comparison Usually those other movies had some awful thing lurking to eat drink and other wise destroy the protagonist in some horrible way In 2001 the villain was HAL a benign entity created by man for man s use Gravity has no such gimmicks Space is the villain at least of a sort But yet it is so beautiful Matt Kowalsky s played by George Clooney beautiful line about the beauty of the Ganges River in the sun is so characteristic of the human mind even as Matt faces extreme adversity Sandra Bullock was astonishing Almost half the movie time she is on camera alone Her eyes her face and even her breathing convey her emotions fears and what few hopes she might have had Frequently we only saw her from within her helmet or from a reflection in a window She sweeps the viewer along from one life threatening event to another Her emotions were palpable George Clooney who played Matt had the absolute confidence of a seasoned astronaut who had seen it all He was relaxed and cool but always in command the kind of person anyone would want along when trouble occurs When Bullock s character was floating freely in away from the troubled space station Matt s remained calm and cool He knew exactly what had to be done Eventually he calmed Bullock s character thus saving her life at least for a minute But Gravity is Sandra Bullock s show And she deserves what ever accolades that come her way The film was beautiful compelling and frightening In a sense the camera pulled the viewer into the movie We become a participant even though our tether is our theater seat Outer space was magnificent awesome and The movie 2001 was pedantic deliberately so dealing withe the metaphysical evolution of life The director chose to hammer the viewer over his head with his philosophy However in Gravity the director and the writer dabbled in symbolism but certainly not into the metaphysical For example the last few minutes of the movie makes makes a beautiful statement about humankind There was little humor in the film 2001 However in Gravity there were some great moments especially in the beginning where Matt is establishing his character Also there is a dandy send up on a Bugs Bunny cartoon And don t miss the ping pong paddle floating freely in the Chinese Space Station If possible see this film in 3D and IMAX I got a stiff neck dodging space debris ranging from pens to hunks of machinery And I go back to Bwanna Devil and the The House of Wax the very early 3 D hits,10
7 October 2013,Old Story New Setting,There is hardly anything technically wrong with this film The 3D the amazing special effects deserve all the credit they will get And the acting was flawless Directing was first class The plot that is the story however was nothing new and loaded with the usual clich s Will Hollywood ever free itself from clich s and stereotypes Gravity tells same story that we are already familiar with Protagonist being pretty much alone in a very hostile environment and facing their mortality and summoning up what it takes to survive reflecting on their past In this case survival means overcoming a series of pitfalls major ones which to his viewer represents a bridge too far and very much what Hollywood will reach for to make a thriller Reminds me of Ahnold as a superhero I digress As I watched the movie immediately began about a couple of people on some ocean mission in perhaps the Southern Ocean and finding that that the ship they were working on was hit by a rogue wave from an unpredicted storm and the female protagonist of course it now has to be a female to be PC was forced to get into a life boat and make her way to a rescue boat which it turns out was also devastated by the storm which blew through and she next tries to get to another ship for safety and so on and so on finally driven ashore by the storm landing next to the shore on a hauntingly beautiful but almost alien looking part of earth I could well imagine the protagonist and the Cloony character going through exactly the same conversations and mental work to survive at sea and one falling overboard and disappearing The survival in the face of repeated disasters in a hostile environment is a story we ve read seen or heard before I found absolutely no new insight into the human condition or what survival is about under hostile conditions You either give up or try anything and everything to survive And these stories are remarkable but this one is hardly credible and asks the viewer to accept way too much coincidence to advance the plot There are real accounts of survival which would make a compelling movie and probably have been made into films though I haven t seen them Does fantasy trump reality For the sci fi lover I suppose the answer is yes No way would the author let the Sandra character get into the first pod and make it to the ISS and safety Indeed that would have been an awesome and possibly a credible story of survival but hardly what the current generation of sci fi viewers and lovers of action flicks would pay for they simply want fantasy and the unbelievable to pass for a glimpse of reality They want their super heroes Putting this story in orbit was not enough It had to be the perfect storm on steroids The film is compared to Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyessy and is hardly in its class Technically yes even more advanced but not in terms of having the viewer transported to a whole different place in the very distant future where men have evolved very little No new human condition concepts in Gravity Hollywood people have made enormous progress in the technology of cinema but seem to sink into the same story frames and clich s Acting directing and dialog as well Scripts I don t think improvement too in many cases Gravity is a perfect example of this problem and why I attend Hollywood films less and less with the exception of a few film makers who produce excellent experience in all ways that cinema can Aside from seeing the space environment which was stunning I was mostly bored and knew exactly what was coming When a film is so predictable it loses my interest,5
2 June 2018,Disappointing,She gets locked out and spends the rest of the movie trying to get back in again,3
3 July 2014,A technical if not narrative achievement,With just 2 characters 3 if you count Ed Harris s voice in the darkness Gravity asks a lot of both the actors and audience to sustain interest in a technically impressive but not dramatically impressive exercise Basically 2 astronauts Clooney at his charming best and Bullock kind of dowdy in this one try to find a means of survival after a cascading series of space disasters That s it as far as story somewhat reminiscent of Hemingway s The Old Man and the Sea in terms of minimalist plot The obvious rigging digital and blue screen motion capture impress in the same way they impressed in James Cameron s Avatar However like the big blue aliens with human boobs Bullock doesn t have a ton of witty dialog or plot twists to work with and much of her actions consist of twisting knobs flipping switches and the like Much of her emotions come down to desperation and exasperation Much has been made of the technical holes but no talks about Bullock s character s admission that she is still deeply affected by the death of her daughter in a traffic accident How did that make it past the psychological review before she was sent in space In short far more of a technical achievement than a great story,7
2 March 2014,Visually nice movie with mediocre story,There is no doubt that this is a very pleasing movie from a purely visual point of view This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery However I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable Overlooking these unfortunately all too often occurring issues the movie is fairly okay as a whole Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it Technically it was very good with nice special effects Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given Clooney felt a bit out of place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much To me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie,6
26 March 2022,Cinematography at a level unlike any other!,The cinematography of this movie is a breathtaking feat unlike anything I have ever seen The commitment to realism influenced every decision throwing the audience into the intensity of every moment An enthralling ride from beginning to end with overwhelming effects and masterful storytelling that makes you feel every second This movie absolutely earned its place on the list of 1001 Movies to See Before You Die Overall A cinematography masterclass,9
2 January 2018,Excellent - the best film this year! Don't miss it.,I went into Gravity with no expectations and this film gripped me and took me on an amazing ride all in under 90min And I certainly didn t see it in 3D If you ve seen the trailer and you re wondering how do they make a film out of an astronaut floating through space when we ve basically seen it all in the trailer then all I can say is go and see this movie it s definitely worth your time Compared to Apollo 13 which was dull and too drawn out Gravity doesn t stop to catch its breath once nice pun It s basically six major scenes set pieces all in rapid fire with Bullock Clooney playing quite interesting characters even though we only get a short time to learn about them It works well as a sci fi space film one of the major selling points is the beautiful shots of Earth from above but also as a tense survival thriller drama How much can go wrong in 90min You ll find out I particularly liked how there s at least some scientific accuracy such as when they re in space an airlock it s virtually silent yes in space no one can hear you scream thanks Alien and sound only filters back in as the air enters the vacuum That and the fact that NASA would have a scientist working on the Hubble telescope rather than a random engineer Gravity does virtually everything well the isolation of space the beauty of Earth the terror of being trapped the would I still go into space if I had the chance and the emotional investment in the characters survival I actually found myself on the edge of my seat a few times,9
13 October 2013,GRAVITY - The best film I have ever seen,Just watched the most amazing film I have ever seen I must say that I am not fond of what film buffs call sci fi and fantasy cinema with its special effects and camera tricks that are so intriguing and beguiling Somehow despite all the high technology and the enormous amounts of money spent on creating mind boggling sets the narratives fail to rise above the mundane and one is left wondering at what the creator of the film was trying to convey that could not have been said with simplicity Most of the so called hi tech movies are modern versions of the old Westerns that were such a delight to watch when we were young No amount of special effects that made Star Wars such a great success at the box office can make it a better or a more engaging film than Gunfight at the OK Corral or The Last Train from Gunhill Hollywood has made a huge investment in studios sets and technology To recover these investments the producers feel that they have to make films with special effects that can use this technology and scripts are tweaked to include the use of mental pyrotechnics in order to keep the spectators on the edges of their seats Blockbuster films like Avatar Inception Oblivion and the Dark Knight saga exploit these techniques to the hilt Their recognition all around the world and the Academy and other international awards they routinely win would seem to justify the investment that the industry has made in these technologies But all the special effects and all the technology only add to the visual appeal of the cinema it does nothing to the content And that is why Gravity is such a different film In the hands of Alfonso Cuaron Gravity becomes a profoundly philosophical experience an intense emotionally exhausting journey into the universe that is unimaginably vast and incomprehensibly complex The story is so simple that it can be written in just one page No wonder actors like Angelina Jolie Natalie Portman and a number of Hollywood celebrities made themselves unavailable for the role of the leading lady I can imagine them telling the Director that the script gave them no scope to display their histrionic talents and that they would not like to waste their energies on such a project Even the male lead played by George Clooney had been offered to Robert Downey Jr the star of the new Sherlock Holmes films but he too might have found the role too minimal for his star status and discovered that he had scheduling problems Teaming up with his writer son Jonas Cuaron and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki with whom he had earlier made the immensely successful Y Tu Mama Tambien Cuaron has created a masterpiece a film that grips you from the first scene shakes your every nerve and leaves you physically and emotionally drained at the end Sandra Bullock playing a medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone on her first space mission is a devoted scientist who leaves her laboratory every evening and drives home to a meaningless existence outside that lab George Clooney is Matt Kowalski a veteran astronaut on his last space mission as its commander The two are performing a routine space walk while repairing some instrument aboard the Hubble space telescope when disaster strikes in the form of a Russian satellite disintegrating and crashing through space destroying other satellites creating a veritable assault of space debris that crashes at astronomical speeds into whatever it encounters in its path In the process the two astronauts get separated from their shuttle and are set adrift in the vastness of their surroundings All the resources available are contained within their space suits and with Oxygen levels dropping their chances of survival are reduced to near zero How the two cope with their predicament is the narrative of the 90 minutes of this stunning film that has perhaps the most wonderful visuals of the universe as seen from 600 Kms above the earth This we must understand is not a Discovery Channel documentary but a human drama taking place not on terra firma but in an atmosphere of zero gravity where there is no atmosphere to speak of The film revolves round these two actors although we do hear the voices of the mission controllers and the third astronaut aboard the shuttle who happens to have some connection with the Indian subcontinent and who keeps singing the famous mera joota hai japani song from Raj Kapoor s Shree 420 The film is shot in 3 D which makes the viewer get totally involved in the action In space where there is no atmosphere to carry sound and where silence is supreme the Director has introduced a musical score that heightens the drama and only science purists will cavil at this cinematic license I am not sure how accurate the physics of the film is but for an average reasonably well educated viewer it should not matter The performance of Sandra Bullock a late choice for the role is undoubtedly her best till date and I am sure the actors who passed this role must be rueing the fact Bullock should easily win the Oscar for this performance of a lifetime George Clooney has yielded top billing to his co star although his performance is no less commendable Gravity should be the hottest favourite to win a clutchful of Academy Awards this year and I cannot see any other film coming close to it in the race for the top honors including all the technical awards Overall it is an extremely satisfying film that raises difficult questions about the limits of science in an infinite universe and whether the laws of physics are the only tools required to resolve the riddles of existence birth death and the human response to intangibles like love care and despair It raises questions about the validity and the role of spirituality in a world governed by science,10
6 January 2022,Epic Space Film,Alfonso Cuaron made a masterful job of putting me the viewer where I exactly I needed to be at the edge of my seat staring at the vastness and panicked at the deafening silence of space Seeing Gravity was definitely immersive experience a film made for the theater but still enjoyable on TV,8
17 November 2013,Time to sense check this decent but over-hyped movie folks.,Oh come on This is a decent enough movie I ll give you that but the outpouring of reverence over it is excessive It s a chase movie in space In fact it s Captain Philips in space that too is somewhat over rated I m not going to go into great detail here because it would be too easy to spoil it for those of you who have yet to make up your own mind I saw it on strong recommendation on an iMAX screen My first and possibly last such commercial exploitation Sure iMAX is bigger and LOUDER But is it better Nope Anyway back to Gravity Sandra Bullock puts in a very good shift but Oscar worthy Surely someone in the movie PR world is having a laugh about that Buzz Lightyear provides solid support The star of the show though are the special effects It is brilliantly realised Stunningly Almost unimaginably so But that doesn t make it engaging It is exciting from time to time But in between the exciting bits whisper this it s a little bit boring Just a little bit But It Is A Little Bit Boring But hey go see it make your own mind up What do I know I m in the minority on this one and people who s creative judgement I trust implicitly have raved about it But me and my better half just thought it was good but a little bit boring Just a little bit,7
11 September 2015,Quite an interesting film,This is an interesting film Weighing pros and cons I actually recommend it if you appreciate some realistic drama situations Shortly after the film begins disaster strikes One of the most interesting things about this plot is that the disaster involved is so realistic that it could actually happen This is a survival story which could really essentially be repeated If you like realistic films this is a good thing It is quite interesting to hear the conversations of the astronauts in the beginning particularly with the slight humour and interesting stories of one astronaut After disaster strikes the drama and thrilling is virtually constant however it is not scary or frightening which makes it all quite interesting At this point the survivor s of the initial disaster I shall not spoil who or how many they were attempt s to stay alive and the way that this all happens is quite remarkable in every aspect as I said it is thrilling and it makes you wonder what will happen next The outcome is very simply surprising These all are good things I enjoyed in the film There were only a few things I disliked The film is in some aspects scientifically inaccurate For details I recommend reading in the FAQ section the question Did the film follow the laws of physics may contain some minor spoilers perhaps you should read after watching the film for a better comprehension Another thing that you may dislike if like me you are an evangelical Christian is that at one point one character prays to a dead person And of course as in most films nowadays there are a few swear words one F word and a number of S words which also reduce the quality of the film Therefore it may not be appropriate to show this film to children Beware also that some perhaps disturbing images are briefly shown and that the entire drama of the film may just be too intense for some sensitive people see Parents Guide for details Nevertheless all in all I must say it was a good film,8
14 March 2015,Absolute garbage if you like Titanic you will like this,Won 7 Oscars Won 7 Oscars This is a sentimental pile of rubbish with too much money No redeeming features Don t bother From the beginning there is nothing believable Astronauts don t fly around in jet packs or bounce off ropes Nothing to do with reality Three stooges had more believable plots Filling this review with 10 lines required is more effort than the writers made for the screen play Naive sentimental unbelievable clich This movie is a frightening reflection of the moronic state of the average movie viewer A cynical depressing statement of feeding stupidity to the apparently moronic movie going public Won 7 Oscars Won 7 Oscars Won 7 Oscars Please use the profits from this to make some great cinema Thank goodness I have seen some great movies lately otherwise after seeing this I would never want to waste my time watching another movie again,1
21 March 2020,OK,Strong visuals and decent acting but personally found dull and boring Not Deserving of so many oscars A very average film,5
9 October 2013,Unbelievable.,Sorry Sandra and George the film is just too incredible to be a good film It s like making a movie about circus lion tamers and showing the introduction of a new and savagely ferocious feral lion into whose jaws the lion tamer then instantly proceeds to safely put his head and after leaving his head inside the lion s jaws for more than ten minutes pulls away as the jaws snap shut and the crowd roars its approval Not believable The reality would be a headless eaten human corpse and an angry feral lion seeking both its freedom and more victims This movie stretched reality so far beyond the breaking point that I could NOT like it I did like the absolutely gorgeous CGI special effects very powerfully done very beautiful I did not like the CGI special effects for their absolute breach of credulity I usually like the acting of Clooney and even to some degree although she is far from being a strong actress in my esteem that of Sandra Bullock But here I found Clooney a clich d version of some of the many characters he s played insouciant at times self absorbed at times seemingly in control even when all conditions indicate a total lack of control in essence he was too much Clooney in Space for the horror of what was unfolding for his and Bullock s characters I didn t believe in his character Bullock is very limited in her ability to convey strong fear which was necessary here my primary objection to her role playing in Gravity Might another actress been better Sure but they would have been stuck in the same surreal and incredible CGI imagery as was Bullock But someone else who could more authentically project emotions would have been better than her I do not wish to write a review with spoilers in it and in this I am not as able to convey most of my criticism of the special effects and the script but this is where I most dislike the movie Things such as running out of oxygen and then continuing to breathe and function for five more minutes or being burnt alive yet being unscathed aren t exactly the stuff of realism but this entire movie is built on such staggeringly overt bloopers Is it any wonder I didn t like it Gravity watches like a good short story reads There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer intrigued and just as there is an intensity in the short story form a compression of dramatic action that allows the short story to be very powerful and memorable so it is with Gravity So the movie does have an intensity which is why many people will like it regardless its awful script shortcomings and errors But a good short story invites the willing reader to believe in the protagonist s plight and if that belief isn t there the story suffers as a result Such is the case with this movie it just isn t believable enough to allow me to buy into it Had they toned down the severity of the near misses reduced the repeated number of escapes from sure death scenarios I think it would have been much more believable and far more powerful a movie Color me unconvinced,7
29 May 2020,Fight until the end.,Through a first fascinating sequence shot with an elaborate cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki that recreates life in outer space we witness the crew of the space shuttle on a routine mission thus Cuar n begins his story from a common event to direct it towards a science fiction story where he slowly turns the viewer into one more character seeing feeling and participating in the fears and emotions of the crew while involving us in the theme and plot of his film We are enjoying the effects of gravity 0 floating dancing and admiring the spectacular views when we suddenly have to face an emergency situation that is triggered in a fraction of seconds by an external factor Then the duality of the meaning of Gravity becomes clear on the one hand the force of attraction exerted by the planets and also the great risk or gravedad that exists in a mission of this type An exciting thriller that transports us to the infinite emotional universe experiencing despair anguish claustrophobia and suffocation but always leaving a last resource to try without fainting Fight until the end In addition to the script written by Alfonso himself and his son Jonas the production of Gravity took more than 4 years due to the complexity of shots and sequences in a 0 gravity environment which forced the creativity and innovation of those responsible of the special effects For the selection of the star 10 of the most recognized names were handled Scarlett Johansson Natalie Portman Marion Cotillard etc but for agenda or various reasons the responsibility falls on Sandra Bullock who despite the deviousness of the production achieves the best role of her career There is a director The film in addition to being a worldwide box office success won 7 Oscars 233 awards and 182 nominations and more importantly positioned Mexican cinema Alfonso Cuar n and Emmanuel Lubezki as great authors of our time Shocking musical score by Steven Price Cast Includes George Clooney,10
20 October 2023,🚀 10th Anniversary Cinema Release of the Multi Award winning Film - Gravity 🌍,Just got out of the 4DX 3D 10th anniversary Re release of Gravity Wow that s a Mouthful I Guess at the Time this was a Groundbreaking Film Here s the Problems Gorgeous Visuals Pieces of Space Station and Spacecraft Dismantling or being Completely Obliterated can only carry a film so far These things should add to the film not be the Crux of the Film And just having Sandra Bullock almost Completely on her own actually Detracts from this being a Better Film Whenever George Clooney was there too it was just a Better Film Things that would of improved the film 1 Have more characters actually alive and part of a space survival mission with various objectives to complete to get out of the situations they find themselves in You can still have character deaths but not immediately 2 Because of having more characters 5 or 6 would do we have more dialogue between characters Sandra Bullock speaking to someone who can t understand her or just speaking to herself is not good enough 3 Again have various objectives scattered throughout a certain attainable radius within Space From point A to Point B to Point C to Point D back to Point A Again Sandra Bullock just on her own in almost constantly dangerous situations isn t as interesting as having a team of 5 or 6 communicating with eachother under pressure in those same situations Things about the Film I liked 1 The Dialogue between the 3 Characters at the start was good to watch and listen to 2 The Visuals were Gorgeous and the film had a Couple of Breathtaking Scenes too 3 The Action Scenes of things breaking up or just being obliterated were good to watch 4 The Score was good when it needed to be good 5 That Shot near the end with The Final Space pod and other debris flying towards earth was a Breathtaking Shot 6 The Very Ending with the shot from underneath and looking up at Sandra Bullock as she looks towards the Sky in Relief was a Beautiful Moment Overall it s a Good Watch that could of Even Better than it actually was,7
10 November 2013,Derivative and Dependent on Special Effects,This was my first visit to a 3D cinema and I am sorry to say the film was a major disappointment The 3D in Gravity is great but it does not carry the film nor make it worth paying to see I feel I ve been tricked by the critics who either saw a different film or have a hidden agenda Gravity has very few characters and they re exceedingly shallow especially Clooney with his ridiculous chirpy optimism totally unrealistic lack of fear and preoccupation with mildly sexual references His only role is to help the main female protagonist survive a series of very similar obstacles put in her way I got the feeling that the goal of the filmmaker was to simply get the message across that women make as good astronauts as men while hoping that hype alone would bring in viewers and thereby negate the need for any discernible plot dialogue or audience engagement The no no no no line Bullock repeats ad nausium which is taken from Prometheus as well as painfully obvious and patronising references to our frailty and dependence on earth etc etc only highlight Gravity s derivative nature This film is the end product of a huge hype exercise it is just 3D special effects with a thin plot and an undercurrent of social and environmental messages dare I say even propaganda Its been done since the 1960s and rehashing it not even very well is just boring I saw people secretly looking at their watches in the theatre after about an hour Film of the Year You ve got to be joking,1
4 January 2020,Bored to death by the female lead,Was secretly wishing she would of just flown out to space and save us the agony of wasting time I am the type of person who hates to abort a movie once Ive started Seriously an untrained chimpanzee would of done a much better job than so called DR Stone Made me hate her character and the actress I need to keep myself together this is the first time that I ve ever developed such disliking for the protagonist As an oscar film expected much more for this Also some common sense she would of flown too far out of space Just let her die already or let her run out of oxygen and suffocate,1
21 February 2021,Average movie,Wait a minute is this the outstanding film that everyone talked about It seems that I saw a different movie average drama thriller sometimes boring Excellent sound great visual effects extraordinary cinematography but plain and lazy storyline,5

16 October 2013,"IT IS A DOCUMENTARY at best, don't get fooled!",This is the most Over hyped movie in history i went to see it because of the great reviews but ended up bored to death The characters are blend at best there IS NO STORY whatsoever You cannot emotionally get attached to no character because they have no backstory Clooney just accepts to sacrifice himself for Bullock simply because it happens like that no goodbye no nothing There is NO CHemistry between the 2 of them they don t even know each other Bullock HAS NO FAMILY NO KIDS nothing waiting for her back home once she makes it back she just smiles a bit raises and goes away No crying no hysteria of happiness for feeling the ground under her feet THe acting is mediocre at best i don t understand why these praised critics dare to say Oscar and Bullock i guess the movie makers payed off a bunch of people to make this movie great on the internet This is a DOCUMENTARY AT BEST and not even a good one THere are LOTS of mistakes and about the space shots i watch documentaries and sci fi since i was 12 i really have seen them all and i can say in good faith that you can see MUCH better universe shots in Through the wormhole or the universe of BBC s,2

6 May 2020,Houston in the blind,Before I watched this movie I wondered how you could make an entertaining film about two people floating around in space In the middle I wondered the same thing By the end I figured it s probably impossible Yes there are some amazing aspects to this production mainly the superb quality of the expanded space environment which presumably is exactly what it is like 600km from earth and the awesome views of earth But this film won 7 Oscars For what OK 2 for best film featuring what it would be like to be in space for a while and best views of planet earth as seen from a spaceship But the other 5 Your guess is as good as mine I know the back story of Dr Stone was supposed to make us all desperately hope she got back to earth safely but honestly every time she frantically grasped onto a piece of space station I found myself hoping that she d miss and drift off into oblivion so the credits would roll and I could go and do something more productive than watch an ageing film star faff around in the great abyss,4

14 December 2020,Space has never been so scary and beautiful at the same time,I remember deciding to watch this movie in cinemas because critics were all praising it as one of the best movies of that year I watched it in IMAX 3D and remember being blown away by the movie It won Best Director Best Cinematography Best Visual Effects Best Film Editing Best Original Score Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars which is a lot of awards The synopsis is Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky George Clooney helming his last flight before retirement Then during a routine spacewalk by the pair disaster strikes The shuttle is destroyed leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue As fear turns to panic they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space I ve decided to rewatch it on a whim but this time on my home TV The question is if this movie is overrated or deserving of its accolades Let s talk about the concept first it s great A survival movie in space with no monsters or anything like that is such a great concept that has not been done before or since its release The movie perfectly illustrates the horror but also the beauty of space in a way that surprisingly meshes well together On that note of the beauty the cinematography is amazing A lot of amazing cinematography is usually using real shots but Gravity does it all through CGI It shouldn t work as CGI is quite obvious and bad CGI can even take you out of the movie but Gravity doesn t fall in that category There are a lot of gorgeous shots that feel like paintings and this is partially thanks to the amazing visual effects The set design for the space ships are claustrophobic and further emphasise the loneliness within this movie The score is great and elevates the tension in the scenes where the score is prominent but during the more hopeful scenes the score is more orchestral and beautiful The movie doesn t rely on the score too much and sometimes just lets the silence of space or the breathing of the astronauts to suck the audience into the movie and it works The movie is visually spectacular but what about the characters and story The movie is revolved around Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock who is our point of view character For the most part the movie makes us care about her because of the situation she is in and that is fine However the director Alfonso Cuar n decided to include a scene that elaborates on Ryan Stone s backstory on Earth This is a good choice as it makes the audience more sympathetic with her and more understanding of why her personality is what it is or why she does certain actions or choices in the movie Matt Kowalsky George Clooney is a sort of anchor character that support Ryan throughout the movie He has a contrasting personality to Ryan as he is funny and charismatic yet due to being more experienced is also one who guides Ryan I like the dynamic between the two of them and when both of them are interacting it s funny or heartwarming I also have to praise Sandra Bulluck as she does a great job in carrying this movie Her performance whenever she is struggling in space feels genuine and I can feel the fear and panic just from the tone of her voice She also delivers in the emotional moments that bring the scene to life She was deserving of that best actress nomination at the Oscars George Clooney does a pretty good job as well Although he mostly just plays Matt as the witty and charming guy I do like it when the two are together George overshadows Sandra which sounds weird but that is exactly what it should be in terms of who their characters are and what the plot is asking I don t have many flaws with the movie that aren t just nitpicking but I do think the fact that Dr Ryan Stone seems to constantly panic in the first half of the movie kind of weird Dr Ryan Stone just seems to not know the basics of being in space so know it all Matt Kowalsky constantly has to tell her stuff that I think she should ve known From a movie perspective I get why this choice was made so that the audience can easily understand things about space but it could ve handled way better in my opinion Additionally we get some backstory on Dr Ryan Stone but we don t get anything on Matt which I find a bit odd and lessens the impact of a certain scene Unfortunately I do think a lot of the impact this movie has is sadly lost because I am not watching it in a cinema You could argue that with a lot of movies but for me watching this throughout certainly made me think this would be way better in a cinema In conclusion I still really enjoyed the movie Yes the movie is impressive because of its style but in terms of substance it certainly is lacking However the movie is just so visually spectacular that I don t mind it Furthermore a lot of great movies such as Dunkirk and 1917 do similar things to Gravity and they are both great movies as well Gravity still is one of the best space movies to have come out in the last 20 years I feel this movie accomplishes a lot with visual effects and space cinematography A lot of people might not be talking about this movie anymore but for me I certainly will still remember it,9
6 October 2013,Lost in space...,When I saw the trailers for Gravity each of them brilliant short panicky glimpses of a desperate situation I had no idea what to expect from the finished film How is this a movie I thought What happens How can they just sustain that for 90 minutes All I knew was that I was going to see the film as soon as possible It was a refreshing inner monologue to have because after most film trailers even for films I am interestedin still seeing I know pretty much what is going to happen in the film by the end and what kind of film it is Gravity was different though I didn t have a clue I am a big fan of Alfonso Cuar n s dystopian action drama Children of Men and he s the only man to make a satisfactory Harry Potter film so I knew with the director I was in safe and interesting hands I am also an unabashed George Clooney disciple believing the man to have pretty impeccable taste in scripts and projects to work on seriously listen to my When Clooney met the Coens podcast he s my man crush Sandra Bullock is a great comedienne and can pretty much raise the standard of any generic rom com or action com she takes part in I haven t seen a lot of her serious worthy films and I don t want to but an interesting choice I thought and a good fit with Clooney So what was going to happen in this mysterious space film Well I am not going to tell you here If you re looking for spoilers or plot points then you ve come to the wrong place because it s best to go into Gravity fresh and ready for anything What I can tell you is that it is one of the most breath taking nerve shredding tension sustaining technically advanced and most complex directed film I think I have ever seen I would need to watch it again not because of any twisty turny story developments but to try and wrap my brain around just the level of organisation and unfathomable skill that went into creating this heart pounding 90 minutes It is a sublime magic trick of a film because unlike the cartoonish nonsense of say Avatar or Abrams Star Trek you just quite reasonably assume that Clooney Bullock and Cuar n filmed the whole thing in ACTUAL SPACE Cuar n realises that to wow and amaze with CGI and modern special effects you don t need to go hog wild and create insane worlds and multi headed monsters just make a seemingly realistic and simple film set in space He did the same thing to similar wonderful effect in Children of Men It s not what you see it s what you don t realise you ve seen You take everything for granted in a Cuar n film and buy the world completely it s only later that you stop and think Wait how on EARTH did they do that In an age where everyone knows oh yeah they just draw that stuff on a computer right you know like ANYONE could do it effortlessly it takes real skill to hush those tongues and drag the audience spellbound and quiet as amazed church mice into your film There is a similar trick that the story pulls and that is that with so few cast members you know somebody logically and presumably is making it to the end of this film alive but that never holds you back from being on the edge of your seat biting your knuckles or gripping the hand of your loved one next to you every time peril rears it s ugly head The acting too is fantastic with Sandra Bullock especially giving to quote EVERY critic on the planet the performance of her career Hell the performance of anyone s career For the physical strain it must have been to make this film alone she deserves all the Oscars Billy Crystal can quickly polish and shove into the back of a Lexus That s not to say Clooney s a slouch but it becomes pretty apparent why they cast him after just a few lines of dialogue in a pleasing welcome way Again like Children of Men the film is a mix of genres It gave me more of a jolt and locked me rigid with tension more than any horror film of recent times it has enough action in it to please any of John McClane s ardent admirers and it s also an achingly beautiful science fiction film with critics throwing around 2001 A Space Odyssey comparisons like happy pretentious puppies with a Kubrick designed squeeze toy It may just be Clooney the minimalist cast and an emotional theme of the film but referencing Solaris in an attempt to seem smart and educated might be slightly more apt actually It is in the emotional character based thread of the film s narrative though that the first tiny critical comment must be made because the slightly over egged and obvious motivations of Bullock s character and the emotional journey she undertakes is not as deep fleshed out or as relevant as the film thinks it is I would argue it s the physical journey and the mental struggle and dilemma that produces that is a more satisfying and watchable than her emotional one However like all good sci fi there s lots of layers to the thing and you can enjoy what you want about it I just didn t think the script or dialogue was particularly strong when dealing with a certain topic that will remain unnamed here It s a film all about connections though in more ways than one and the ultimate connection we must make with our own lives That being said it s also pleasingly about hair raising stunts and explosions in space Unusually if I urge you to go see this film at all it s for that latter reason the sheer jaw dropping spectacle of it all,8
22 April 2014,"Visually Dazzling, But Slack on Emotional Impact",3 5 5 Gravity gives us some of the most impressive visuals ever put on screen It is also mostly accurate to the rules of space like there being no sound when debris collides with the space shuttle We are pulled into space itself and it is a magical experience What really brings us in is some impressive camera work as well like showing the astronauts perspective of what s going on in front of them and hearing their loud breaths Everything is fully detailed and at its place as far as sound visuals and mostly accuracy If there are any flaws in accuracy mostly only astronomers would be able to tell It won t bother anything at all to how impressively well done everything is The movie is pretty thrilling as well The visuals create some very realistic disaster situations that don t go over the top to coincidences but what can really happen in space a fragile place that can be disastrous to mankind It does a great job at showing that The problem however is the emotional depth the movie is and sometimes the direction it goes It is sometimes is too busy with the visuals that it doesn t give much time for character development There are emotional scenes that are supposed to be gripping and compelling but they aren t really compelling unless we have a backstory that is somewhat interesting It is kind of effective in a way but the movie works much better if it was a more visual wonder than emotional like 2001 A Space Odyssey The story was not about a certain character but mankind itself and it told its story through visuals not emotion or dialogue Gravity tried to do both but too be honest they should have just stuck to more of a visual approach or give us some interesting character background The story is obviously about a character surviving Let us get to know her more If only the emotional backstory was more compelling I would be happy to be with the crowd of saying it s one of the best films of the year But I would say it s a good movie but not a great one People will go to theatres expecting a visual wonder For the most part it succeeds but the emotional parts will distract you But I guess people just want more eye candy and if they do this is for them Still I can recommend this for the thrills and visual wonder it creates to the screen Gravity is a tense and very thrilling visual experience that is well shot and paced,5

6 October 2013,"Visually, Acoustically, and Cinematographically Superior",Essentially the whole movie takes place in space The visuals are so breathtaking it would be a worthwhile investment even if that was all the movie had to offer The realism of their null gravity environment is astonishing and periodically throughout the film I wondered how on earth haha pun they managed to film it without actually being in space Cuaron also takes advantage of the characteristic eerie quiet of the vacuum of space You often hear things from the perspective of the character in question e g an enormous explosion produces only deep dull tones as it resonates through metal that the astronaut is grasping It s incredibly effective and contributes to the high tension atmosphere haha another pun of the film But one of my favorite aspects of the film was the cinematography Alfonso Cuar n is known for doing very long single takes where the scene follows the perspective of a single camera for the duration rather than switching between multiple views as is more typical in cinema If you ve seen Children of Men one of Cuar n s other directorial works you may recall the 378 second single take scene in which the camera follows the main characters through an intricately crafted war zone It s exquisite In Gravity the first 17 minutes of the film are done in a single take The result is an incredibly immersive experience that holds you in the unrelenting dizzying terrifying void of space In short see this movie Try to be aware of the acoustic and cinematographic nuances that subtly enhance the viewing experience And if at all possible I HIGHLY recommend that you see it in IMAX 3D There are very few films that are actually improved by viewing in 3D but this is undoubtedly one of them 10 10,10
3 March 2014,"""You should see the Sun on the Ganges!""",GRAVITY is fine if you just take it for what it is A sci fi thriller that is watchably compelling with a number of twists and turnabouts but without a lot of plot depth character development or any of that sort of thing It has a few stretches and improbabilities but it s awfully hard to make a film of this sort without some of those Comparisons have been made with 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY but GRAVITY does not begin to hold the slightest nubbin of a candle to a classic of that stature All the same good performances by Bullock Dr Ryan Stone and Clooney veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski who are the only living characters we actually see here Though the Earth below looks rather artificial some nice use of gadgetry and special effects I put off watching GRAVITY because it looked fairly predictable It does however go in some unexpected directions Yet the story starts a bit too late More on the nature of the shuttle mission and the relationships between Stone Kowalski and the rest of the crew before the disasters strike would have added something even if it would also have complicated things Purely a matter of taste but I think the middle portions would have benefited from more on the angst and strange thoughts that arise while trapped alone in space and less of the constant thriller diller stuff we have here,6
26 October 2013,Worst film ever!,I only registered for IMDb to write this review I am a biomedical engineer myself and was very excited to watch the movie I booked a VIP ticket for this movie night show We lost interest in the movie within 10 minutes and it was hard to keep ourselves interested in the movie The entire movie is in the outer space which bored the hell out of us no special plot no good graphics animations destruction We thought it would be something like the world facing a big destruction and the survivors are left in the outer space to survive The acting was okay but the entire money did not live up to our expectations Total waste of time and money,1
12 October 2013,Breathtaking mixture of action and beautiful CGI .,This movie is a masterpiece It is is a very strange movie but it s the strange what makes it outstanding The long quite scenes and the fast action scenes battling each other leave you struggling for air My eyes were on the screen all the time and my ears were amused too Apart from the great voice acting of Sandra s the music choice was very good too Dramatic orchestral music really helps to bring the audience into the atmosphere of the scene and enhances the watching experience a lot I have to say that I have never watched such good CGI in my life The images of Earth are breathtakingly realistic Finally the thing that I liked the most in this movie is the attention to details and the painstakingly accurate physics in space To conclude this movie is definitely a must see I m not a movie critic of any kind but I think I m not wrong if I say this deserves an Oscar,10

8 September 2023,Spectacular,Clooney and Bullock both at their best Cinematography literally out of this world Screenplay absolutely amazing with incredible camera work Every frame compellingly gripping including long takes of gravity free blood and tears Ironic how there is no titular gravity in almost the whole affair Utterly fantastic storyline is realistically presented Jaw dropping special effects Directed to use silence better than a noisy annoying soundtrak as typically deployed in outer space movies Immersively riveting in its entirety it simultaneiously presents human frailty and strength tragedy and triumph,10

21 April 2014,Not for Those Who Are Familiar With Science,Gravity was more of a comedy than a drama for me due to its laughably inaccurate technical aspects Yes the special effects are visually impressive but they could not make up for the movie s technical flaws IMHO this is science fiction 1930s Buck Rogers style In spite of its technical flaws an actual story might have saved Gravity from being a complete waste of time Pros Sandy B still looks hot in her underwear I hope that wasn t a spoiler Impressive visual effects when persons were inside the various spacecraft especially the translation movement of persons through the various vehicles and the individual floating objects that persons encountered along the way Cons The depiction of all aspects of orbital mechanics especially the movements of the astronauts outside the spacecraft everything about the orbital debris and the damage caused by the orbital debris,3
8 November 2013,Pedestrian,The great virtue of Gravity is that I will be very unlikely to ever spend several hundred thousand dollars on a tourist space travel ticket even if I had the money to burn which I do not expect to have The views may be out of this world although not in this movie but space travel is awkward at best Cramped quarters disoriented floating most inhospitable and unforgiving environment just outside the door hatch unpleasant flight home The only justification would be vanity Hey look at me I m an astronaut What else about the movie The plot is lame the acting ordinary even the views are pedestrian There is heroism but that plot twist is a rehash of several space movies dating back to at least the 1950s,3

28 September 2014,Sadly disappointed,I was anxiously waiting to see this movie after it had been advertised Finally caught it on HBO I have really enjoyed watching Sandra Bullock in all the movies she has ever done and she did do an amazing acting job in this movie However I was disappointed with how fake and seemingly unrealistic the scenes were in the movie There were several times that Bullock s character would have died due to extreme changes in pressure I also thought Bullock s character could have been developed much more into a good story line To me the movie was just a series of events that did not create any realistic suspense Unfortunately sadly disappointed,3

28 October 2013,"Nothing more than action, playing with your senses, all form, no content",I agree with reviewer tcara111 An empty film this one truly empty Strange though how ones body can react so intensely on something that is about nothing at all Seen in 3D it makes you dance around in your chair dodging space dust grabbing your seat engaging with the bodies of the characters who risk floating into deep space forever if they can t hold on to the space station But this is the sole thing the film does It plays with your senses and nothing more This is just fetish fetish with new effects used as toys to play with your eyes ears and sense of suspension And at the end you have nothing Nothing nothing Nothing wrong with entertainment Loved Pirates of the Caribbean of the same director A very funny film colorful characters But this is not only not funny it is anti funny The jokes are so lame made of the same wood as the jokes Indiana Jones makes making ironic remarks while in an impossible situation Hollywood seems to have a monopoly on this stupid form of irony which made exactly zero people laugh in the theater So 1 star because 1 this film is about nothing at all and 2 it is about nothing nothing at all,

11 February 2019,Awesome visualizations,Gravity has it s moments The visuals looked great the production is on point At times this felt like a perfect movie even if it was just for a few moments Maybe the runtime is too short and therefore some things in the plot are lacking It s arguable if the script is logical some things made sense some not that much but overall it s believable,7
7 June 2019,Boring,The movie s good and has a good message of course But it s just one short story and you ve to spend 90 minutes of your life to watch it Go on watch it But tell somebody to turn your device off when you will sleep watching it,5
2 August 2023,Not what I was looking for!,Gravity Two astronauts work together to survive after an accident leaves them stranded in space Well I m really disappointed As a big fan of Sci fi movies this film didn t feel like one visually it is but in the big picture it felt like an action movie in the space and nothing more While the image was astonishing the plot and the scrip weren t interesting no Sci fi concept and just a survival movie that happened to take place in the space I appreciated Sandra Bullock and George Clooney but they could ve put anyone instead of them since the film doesn t give much dramatically This just wasn t for me,6

22 November 2013,Nice effects but no story,Sadly this film was all about the nice visual effects and little else It starts with the main characters already in space and goes from there There is very little character building throughout the film and the details that are exposed are straight out of the clich handbook of story lines this makes it very difficult to engage with the leads with any conviction As the film progresses the realism starts to fall away very quickly in aide of attempting to drive the story along and maintain interest in the characters and their plight As a result this means Sandra Bullocks character looks like an incompetent fool for most of the film as she stumbles from one clumsy moment to the next Her continual incompetence made the film more and more implausible as time went on and quite unbearable as it reached its conclusion cringe There are also some very long drawn out moments that are very close to disconnecting with the audience altogether About half way through I was bored I was quite relieved when the film finished and I suspect most of the audience were too judging by the murmurings when we exited the theatre Honestly I am shocked this film is getting such high reviews Did other reviewers see a different film Sadly this film did not deliver which is a shame as I suspect a lot of the budget went on the stunning visual effects when more time and devotion should have been spent on a plausible and engaging script,5

26 October 2013,A wonderful sub-plot!,Saw this last night and was pleasantly surprised Here the Thomapl review This nail biting quasi sci fi 3 D drama with a cast of two is not so much about an outer space tragedy accident as it is about a kind strong good hearted man helping a scientist overcome her fears grief and insecurities in the gentlest most patient manner It s about a good man who helps a good woman become better It could easily have been the other way round Think Sally Ride rather than Sandra Bullock I won t give away any of the plot turns or denouement but watch it through my lens and I ga run tee you ll enjoy it I give it an A,
17 February 2021,Great message!,Great movie Dialogue What do you think there should have said more than that if you found yourself in that situation Are you kidding Are you idiot That s the dialogue period For all of those who gave a low score I m not considering those who gave 1 because they were out of oxygen so they weren t able to understand anything try to get the message then you ll appreciate this movie as it is I loved this movie never bored always trying to understand what was the next move as it often would happen in the real life don t give up even when everything is going so bad that it s quite impossible to change the situation you can t know how close to the solution you can be A very good teaching but many people aren t able to understand the deep message inside this movie Lacking of awareness that s the real problem in the World,10
7 October 2013,Brilliant!,If you remotely liked Apollo 13 or appreciate cinematography or thrillers you need to see this movie To describe it as Open Water in space is like calling Da Vinci just a painter It is probably the only film I ve seen that is meant for 3D IMAX as you can feel like you re floating at times CGI or not there are times when you look at Gravity s view of the Earth and think it could be the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel Like any movie some suspension of disbelief is necessary for a great story There is also some movie underdog sentimentality in the dialog at times but it doesn t hurt the story or the action The short runtime keeps things moving and generally doesn t let you catch your breath Cast Away is probably the most apt comparison I can think of and that still fails I am not a Sandra Bullock fan but she carries most of the movie very well When you recall other actors having trouble emoting in front of a green screen it becomes apparent how good Bullock is Add to that the technical magic CGI choreography lighting stunts etc required to make the film s environment credible and it is easy to see why some are calling it a masterpiece Flaws exist in everything this movie is good enough to make you not care,9

16 January 2014,Waah! I didn't like the film because I don't get things...,Waaah I don t like hearing humans breathe waaah the Sun was too bright waaah I couldn t finish Jr college waaah there wasn t enough dialog waaah space is boring waaah that was the wrong color of the Earth waaah I know science more than in the movies waaah I m overweight and the prime of my life isn t what I expected That s what 90 of those of you who didn t like the film sound like to the rest of us You can t even formulate a proper review much less be able to understand a well written and directed film Just face it Alfonso Cuaron created a masterpiece and you guys still live at Mom s house,10
23 February 2014,"No Beginning, No Ending",I agree with another reviewer who said Gravity is visually stunning especially in 3 D the outer space scenery is just beautiful However to me and my two friends who sat through this plot wise it was boring and frustrating There are only two characters Sandra and George and all they do is float around drifting drifting drifting I only know that George s character is a veteran astronaut in command of his last flight before retiring from reading this on IMDb I do not KNOW THIS from seeing the movie because the movie EXPLAINS NOTHING I also know that Sandra is a medical engineer on her first ever space mission only from reading IMDb not FROM SEEING THE MOVIE because the movie explains nothing The 90 minutes that we saw was great for a middle of a movie but there was no beginning and no ending We wanted to see Sandra and George at home first or at the space center to learn who they are and what they will be doing in space And at the end we wanted to see a rescue party save Sandra and see her home we wanted a resolution I only recommend this movie to people who are big fans of either Sandra Bullock or George Clooney,4
22 April 2023,Artsy anxiety and depression movie.,Be warned This is a chick flick about experiencing and overcoming anxiety and depression disguised as a space movie If you don t absolutely love Sandra Bullock be warned the movie is 90 focused on her and her experience of having various emotions There is no real attempt made to even make it believable as a space movie as you notice with literally the first lines of dialogue that her character would never be accepted as an astronaut candidate due to mental health problems Her oxygen is simultaneously running out and yet inexhaustible Major plot points depend on there being wind in space Etc If you are looking for movies that celebrate girl power anxiety depression etc and you love Sandra B you may enjoy this and have fancy visuals to keep you entertained If not you ll want to skip,1
11 October 2013,Gravity is a must watch. Nothing like anything till date.,When James Cameron first said after the screening of Gravity that it s the best space movie till date then I didn t believed him I considered it a marketing gimmick Well how will you react to a space movie with just 2 characters shown in the promo and no aliens and bombs or anything of that fashion We are so much used to a Pacific Rim or Transformers that Space movies simply means to us to be full of invading aliens and humans trying to be hero and at last winning Gravity is a totally different take It s nothing like anything seen till date If Perfect is a word which means no flaws well it s simply goes true for Gravity From camera to music to acting everything seems flawless Gravity is a story of simple humans with flaws who rise up and put up a fight no matter how adverse the situation is It s the story of how heroes are not born but made in a matter of minutes because accepting defeat is simply not an option Watch Gravity as it pole vaults the current cinematic standards by yards and sets up a whole new benchmark Gravity is beautiful has a deep meaning and might inspire you in many ways Very very very very very highly recommended,10

22 May 2022,I feel like I have shards of glass in my ears.,For the first 20 minutes Sandra Bullocks character is doing nothing but hysterically screaming 24 7 She then proceeds to somehow know absolutely nothing about being in space How she got sent much less how she was allowed to do a space walk I will never know Though the biggest plot hole in this entire movie is the space debris Every hour and a half it passes just to conveniently destroy every shred of matter except for whatever the main character is in or attached to Interesting concept but it sucked,3
30 October 2013,"A Good Film, but Over-hyped",Yes there is no denying that gravity is a solid film However the only reason why I m rating it a 1 10 instead of a worthy enough 7 10 is because 8 6 10 for this film is simply too high The plot was very limited and because of this they were ultimately effective in delivering a some what entertaining experience which was in my opinion because of the cinematography sound and editing The acting script and plot were nothing short of mediocre however the use of angelic music to heighten certain scenes in the movie as well as the utilisation of a variety of sounds sometimes even being complete silence was done perfectly and captivated most of the audience An example of this was the high pitch noises which compelled the viewer towards the plight of the protagonists situation and added a sense realism The camera work should also be commemorated But hey what can you expect from Alfonso Cauron after his critically acclaimed Children of Men which was notorious for it s hand held like camera techniques and cinema verite Visual effects were also top notch i may add Bottom line This movie should be rated a 7 5 10 not 8 6 10 It is simply too high for such a mediocre storyline script and acting performances I recommend seeing it in 3D though Also to give you a perspective on the absurdly high rating gravity received it is currently 8 6 it is rated higher than any other space movie that i know of including 2001 space odessy alien and the original star wars Do you actually think gravity is worthy of being 20 on the top 250 movies of all time IMDb list It s currently higher than gladiator the departed dark knight rises American history x and saving private ryan which are all in my opinion much much much better and worthier to be in the top 250 than gravity,1
4 October 2013,Gravity: The Best Space Film after '2001',Watched Gravity in IMAX screen Wadala India Wow I just watched the Best Film of 2013 Even calling it a film is absolute injustice Coz it isn t a film it s actually an experience more of a space ride Yes after the movie was over I couldn t walk comfortably because my mind was spinning just like the astronauts in the film The whole film is set in space two astronauts are left stranded outside their spacecraft and then its all about how they struggle to reach Earth George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give their career s best performance especially Bullock The movie engages you hooked up to the screen with its amazing visuals of space that even blinking your eye is forbidden For every 2 3 minutes you ll say wow This movie will surely fetch all the major technical awards at the Oscars especially Visual Effects Cinematography Sound Effects Background score and Editing If Sandra Bullock doesn t get an Oscar nomination for her performance then I will lose all my faith in the Oscars I seriously recommend everyone to watch it in IMAX even if its thrice the normal ticket price or if its far for you to travel You ll be amazed and will cherish the film even after hours walking out of the screen Truly the Best Film of the year Rating 11 out of 10 Yes you read it right,
9 November 2013,Amazing and Thrilling Experience,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,10
9 October 2013,Excellent for it's genre,If you expect to watch a 2012 end of the world or some zombie attack movie save your few bucks and stay at home For those who enjoys sci fi scenarios simulations closer to home however the farther end was Prometheus the equally exciting movie this is a must watch this year The depth of feel was pretty good in 3D without making the oooh 3 D clich of focusing too much on trying to impress using the 3D elements like many early 3D movies choreography My only peeve was the rushed ending sequence and the twist of good fortune that made Shenzou capsule re entry appear almost incident free in stark comparison to the rest of Tiangong The end was too bland which could have benefited from short educational sequence for younger viewers on what would have happened to the astronaut Clooney drifted in space without the EVA life support but that s merely from an educational perspective of course Nonetheless well done Alfonso and Jonas Cuar n Will be on the lookout for your upcoming movies,9
3 October 2013,"Thrilling and accomplished, but not much else",So GRAVITY Acclaimed at Venice and TIFF praised by critics everywhere brought to us by visionary director Alfonso Cuar n and starring two A Listers who bizarrely have never worked together before Also while not all that science fiction y since most of this is pretty much possible within the bounds of humanity s current level of tech which is in itself pretty amazing the fact that this serendipitous confluence of filmmaker film royalty and film festival fanfare should fall even remotely within our purview has made this movie and its probable awesome a hot topic around Geek Speak headquarters for months Which is why I am sorry to report that it s just it s just not that good Oh it is replete with simply breathtaking special effects and the cinematography or whatever passes for cinematography when most of your action takes place on a green screen is top notch GRAVITY is also a thrill ride of fear and dread as our plucky if annoyingly shrill heroine Sandra Bullock and her only surviving astronaut colleague George Clooney are left adrift in space after satellite debris attacks their orbital position and kills anyone who has not won an Oscar But if you ve seen the movie BURIED the one with Ryan Reynolds trapped in a cave in on the phone to a calm voiced company rep and if you haven t you should it s great then you will get the general gist here except that BURIED doesn t burden us with pointless and torturously sentimental third act exposition about character backstory for no good reason at all Everyone hated AFTER EARTH and hey I get it those accents were awful but it relied a lot on the same conceit I m not saying GRAVITY doesn t do it better I m just saying GRAVITY is kind of like AFTER EARTH which is I m guessing something no one wanted to hear The plot is a super simple one so simple in fact that I already gave it to you in less than a sentence in the above paragraph What remains is pretty much silence and while that silence can be pulse thumpingly terrifying and is used to good effect because in space no one can hear you scream unless they re on the com its cynical employment throughout is symptomatic of the film as a whole It is all very effective but it is not very affective You will probably be entranced immersed and enthralled from pretty much the outset I ll concede I certainly was but when all is said and done GRAVITY is as unrealistic as clich and as forgettable as any other popcorn action horror flick perhaps even more so It s basically the cinematic equivalent of a carnival ride Space Mountain if it lasted for 90 minutes and got really boring towards the end I think it s trying to be all metaphorical at its denouement but honestly when your subtext is written in such a large font it goes from pointed allegory to outright laughable stupidity quicker than you can say No one ever taught me to pray Not by the way the movie s cringe iest line There are a lot of contenders for that title maybe it s a lost in translation thing Like when hit Asian rom coms get Hollywood remakes and all the over the top humor is rendered bizarre Because the overwrought periods of Cuar n Sr and Jr might not be out of place in a favorite telenovela but they fit very uncomfortably here Wait Is that racist If you are planning to see GRAVITY and I still think you should if for no other reason than that everyone else will then I suggest you do it while it is still in theaters unless your home is equipped with a 3D projector and at least a twelve foot blank wall Because this is a movie that is pretty much built for IMAX 3D and without the additional element of visceral terror that comes from feeling like you too are hurtling through the inky black night accompanied only by the panicked irritating breathing of a stranded human rapidly losing hope of rescue then this movie doesn t really have a lot to offer It s rewatch quotient is pretty much zero as well so purchasing it on Blu ray is simply out of the question even if you do decide to watch it in your hypothetical kickass home entertainment room that I now totally want You know what it is George Clooney as genial and handsome and charming as he is and oh he is Bullock is excellent here too with way more screen time should just stay the hell out of space I won t say he should stay out of our genre because THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS FROM DUSK TILL DAWN Hell even SPY KIDS But considering SOLARIS and now this I think it is time to revoke his off world privileges much as his superhero license was surely incinerated after his ill fated stint as Batman And as for Alfonso Cuar n he s a truly great director who should stick to putting other people s big ideas up on the big screen CHILDREN OF MEN was a triumph of adaptation a movie that not only had something to say but said it beautifully Here the message if such there be is lost in the CGI and all the while the Laws of Physics are treated like they are made of Play Doh which is especially ironic given the title GRAVITY is lots and lots of style but not much substance and once you leave the theater and your pulse rate returns to normal it s difficult to recall exactly what had you so excited to begin with,6
14 October 2013,Visual and Eargasm Galore,Without meaning to over sell the film there is nothing that I can say that will prepare you for the experience that is Gravity It is the most aptly named movie ever and you will know why by the end of it There is a lot of positive talk about great acting but I don t think this is what this movie is about When people will discuss Gravity it will not be for the acting or the storyline it will first and foremost be about the cinematography which is in one word unique I m not familiar with the director or his other work but I read somewhere that he wanted to be an astronaut This movie comes from a special place one of passion and childhood aspirations Experience it in 3D IMAX if possible,9
8 October 2013,This movie was truly brilliant.,You can t make a film better than Gravity It broke all the earnings records for the month of October but I m sure this is just a fraction of what this film will earn All in all this is a perfect 10 Gravity earned a whopping 55 6 million dollars this past weekend This figure just exceeded the previous October record of 51 million held by Paranormal Activity 3 released in 2011 If not for the Gravity 3 D release there s a good chance it wouldn t have attained the record The earnings are just a start for Gravity With the hype surrounding performances by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Warner Bros will stand to make quite a bit more in the coming months Everybody should try to see this movie in an IMAX theater See more at http www noobmovies com news 60 sthash Ld3qVSma dpuf,10
7 October 2013,Disappointing,Not much to say thin and clich d plot On the plus very well done Wow they make you write more in the review here than what I just wrote O K so I ll keep going I love Sandra Bullock and her work and think George Clooney is great That was not the problem In my view the problem was the script and whoever thought it was a great script Not a great script As I already said thin and a massive clich I did see it IMAX 3 D sorry I spent the money though It certainly wasn t worth it So since I was already there the money already spent I did enjoy the IMAX 3 D experience Pretty awesome,2
13 May 2020,OK,Gravity 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuar n starring Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone and George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky depicted American Astronauts stranded in space after their shuttle is destroyed The concept is very interesting and has the potential to be a great story but the film was lackluster in its storytelling I waited for the story to pick up and get interesting and it never did The film felt slow and the story never picked up even the end felt abrupt as there was no build up to it The story had no progression and felt very one note There were moments that seemed very forced to try and make it exciting and interesting but they felt out of place in the movie Although there were aspects of the movie that were interesting such as the first person shots and the silence during parts of the film The silence was powerful in that it truly reflected space The first person shots were unique and made you see the film through the characters eyes But these moments did not make up for the lackluster story telling The ending was OK and worked for the story but also fell flat of the grand moment it was set up to be Overall the film was slow and didn t measure up to the epic story that it could have been,3
15 October 2013,Astonishing 91 minutes of complete 3D cinematic experience that too with space exploration!,The movie entails the silence of space where two astronauts played by Ryan Sandra Bullock and Matt George Clooney goes through very tough survival conditions The actors show a great vigor and genuine support to each other while struggling to save their lives as these two were the sole survivors left from the failed space mission The movie will surely move you with its amazing 3D effects Splendid performance by Sandra Bullock Choice of using the Universal Space by the creative team to showcase the 3D effects proves absolutely eclectic It is a great movie that is potent enough to beat all your expectations from a sci fi movie It will surely land you in a serene aura and undergo the vicarious feelings of being part of such a wonderful science fiction It is certainly a bar raiser for the creative folks who are constantly striving to amaze people via innovative 3D effects Innovation at its best,10
14 October 2013,"A terrifying, beautiful experience.",Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is on her first mission in space along with Matt Kowalski George Clooney and others but when debris comes soaring in the two are sent adrift and must find a way back to Earth Gravity is one of the best movies I have ever seen It is an absolute masterpiece of special effects and white knuckle suspense and I wasn t expecting it but the characters journeys particularly that of Dr Ryan Stone are quite moving The effects were 100 convincing The CGI especially in 3D is absolutely gorgeous and Alfonso Cuaron s directing is breath taking literally I found myself holding my breath during some sequences My stomach would rise into my chest and I was saying in my head Grab something grab something grab something The acting it was perfect Not once did I doubt that these were real people not actors and that is even more impressive when you consider the star status of our two leads Sandra Bullock really flexes her acting muscles here That is what I call a performance She completely pulled it off as a woman who has lost her will and somewhere along the way she realizes the difference between not wanting to die and wanting to live and she makes a decision and it is touching to say the least This movie feels real We all know it s just a movie but when you re sitting there watching the screen it s all happening in real life right before your eyes Go see it It is an intense experience unlike anything you ve seen before A,10
1 August 2021,Intense,There is not a lot of dialogue in this movie but image is enough to make this movie a classic space movie,8
20 October 2013,In a word: meh.,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,3
12 November 2013,Perfection on screen,By the time anybody might read this I m almost certain they ll know enough about it without me explaining any sort of plot characters etc The reason I m writing this is in regards to the reception this film has garnered For the vast majority it s being recognised as a phenomenal achievement it is Let me start by saying there is absolutely no two ways about it Gravity is as close to visually perfect as visually perfect has ever been Lighting design CG animation costume I can t even begin to stress just how flawless the filmmaking involved in the visual aspect to this film are Believe me when I say maybe once or twice a decade a film like this comes around Do not miss it Anything less than a cinema experience will not do this film the justice it truly deserves Now many people will try and tell you that the characters are not fleshed out that the script isn t spectacular that the science might be a little off To those people I say it doesn t matter If this film was scientifically perfect it would lessen the experience for the 90 who don t care If this film had a longer more fleshed out script it might seem like padding to most it might lead the film to outstay its welcome This film is 90 minutes long not a second was wasted A film is made for entertainment some do a better job than others To the small minority who would have liked to have seen perhaps a more investigative study into the human condition a more accurate scientific representation of space I say good for you To the people who would try and find fault with this AS A PIECE OF ART AND CINEMA for the aforementioned reasons I say your opinion is irrelevant From a filmmaking aspect this film is flawless as for the subjective aspect of opinion think what you want I personally thought it did exactly what it intended to do to me as a viewer and I can t ask for a single thing more,10
26 October 2013,"Lots Of CGI, Little Story",Okay go see the movie Gravity Why Because it gets a super high rating Because everybody else has seen it so you ll be able to carry on an informed conversation about another CGI movie and be up to date But don t expect much in the way of dialogue characters or plot in fact don t expect anything The first fifteen minutes of dialogue if dialogue interests you just might have you scratching your head Who wrote this drivel And it doesn t get any better well it can t actually Sandra Bullock and George Clooney Okay they help Gotta have a couple nice looking stars to sell the product From my point of view that s good enough reason for them to be in the movie but sorry I don t see any awards here This is a lot of 3D CGI and a lot more 3D CGI I just don t see that it s all that great sorry A half hour of that ll do me And adding to the problem was the discount matin e price of 20 for two Sorry for me way overpriced I suggest if you re on the fence about this to wait until it gets to a discount 2 theater In the meantime you can pretend you ve seen it just ooh and aah and mention the objects in space that looked like they were floating over my seat and so on But if you like things like story characters dialogue plot twists and real cinematography not that there s much of that around anymore but hey once in a while something does come along well I wouldn t waste too much of your money or time on Gravity Way over hyped,5
12 October 2013,A movie that redefines the experience of watching movies in cinema halls,GRAVITY is a Space thriller that depicts the sensitivity of space travel with a great attention to detail With amazing cinematography and realistic visual effects viewers are drawn into an electrifying yet mystical journey in space picturing both beautiful and horrific sides of GRAVITY even when you are not far from home It will be remembered as one of the best Space movies ever made The impact of scenes is heightened by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives the warm face of the planet and the depths of dark space the randomness but also predictability of the deadly debris field and silence of the vacuum of space with the sound of the Marvelous Background Score Its a movie to be watched on the big screen with 3D only,9
1 February 2014,"Neat visuals, no more",This film was a pretty big disappointment I had only a vague idea of how it would play out in terms of plot but was expecting it to be a competent sci fi film It was not Gravity carries with it a pretense of realism but throws it out the window in the first couple minutes Why the film even bothers in taking the time to point out that space is indeed silent is beyond me since there s always some sound playing It s as if it s afraid to let go and take the viewer seriously a streak that runs throughout the film Above all else I get the sense that Cuar n wanted to make a film that was essentially CAST AWAY IN SPACE WITH SPACE EXPLOSIONS AND CATASTRPHIC RE ENTRY and for what it s worth all those elements are here and executed effectively But none of the things any sensible person would expect to see here are present Why is it for example that the only communication Bullock manages to establish with the surface is with an amateur radio operator Does Cuar n really believe that NASA relies entirely on satellites to stay in touch with astronauts Does he really think they would be unable to use ground based means in case of an emergency that renders ALL of their conventional channels inoperable The above is however a minor gripe and the same goes for all other ignorance regarding orbital mechanics What really irks me about this film is the infantile dialogue At no point watching this film was I ever convinced the people on screen were astronauts and that is the paramount failure of Gravity,3

7 November 2019,Sandra Bullock Grunting For Over An Hour,I ll save you from a like minded negative review Yeah the science is bad plot weak script non existent But what really threw me over all of it was considering the ramped up soundless space the only dialog and most sounds come from Sandra Bullock s space suit comm system Well bully are we lucky for that As she flails around space forever the film is just one soundtrack of here gruntingin screaming and smashing into things What a waste of a great concept,4

2 April 2020,a visually cool movie,Gravity is a beautiful movie and good experience when watched in the cinema regarding the outstanding realistic CGI it shows us the endless emptiness and silence up in space However the weak plot acting and dialogue makes the movie very boring,7
13 March 2014,"Gravity is visually amazing, but the dialogue is far from perfect",Gravity is written and directed by Alfonso Cuar n along with his son Jon s Cuar n and George Clooney collaborating on a sequence of the films script Just like American Hustle Gravity is nominated for 10 Oscars and is the front runner in a lot of categories according to critics What stands out me is the nomination for best actress in a leading role for Sandra Bullock Whilst I think Sandra Bullock is an amazing actress and all I do not think she deserves an Oscar nom for this I would even go as far as to say she was quite bad in some parts but I ll get into that later What I do think this movie deserves however is without a doubt a win for best visual effects this really blew everything out of the water If it turns out the award goes to one of the other noms I think that would be more than lame Gravity is overall a great film it had a lot of great aspects to it but got a little brought down by some not so great aspects On the great side there was the visual effects they were stunning Especially seeing it in IMAX 3D I usually prefer seeing films in 2D but man this movie used it to perfection There was also the great directing Alfonso Cuar n really got it right with this and deserves pretty much all the praise he is getting right now However on the not so great side there s the screenplay It was very inconsistent you could tell that the two people writing it were just not on the same level The dialogue was more than cheesy at some points it got pretty bad At some points it was great and at some point maybe even awful Yep definitely felt inconsistent This is why I feel it might be a little unfair of me to say that I don t think Bullock deserves an Oscar for this pretty much all of her weak acting was in the sequences with the poor writing and there isn t much an actor can do about a poor script But yeah I m sticking to my opinion Clooney on the other hand I loved and I think it has a lot to do with how moderately his character was used From what I ve heard from people who s met actual American astronaut veterans he embodies it perfectly He definitely had some great line delivery and did very well with his facial acting Overall this film was great does it deserve to win for best picture however Perhaps I wouldn t be jumping out of my chair in anger if it did But definitely best visual effects without a doubt But maybe leave your son out of the loop on your next project Alfonso,8
8 April 2020,The best visual effct.,Complete victory of technology The viewing effect is unparalleled My palm was sweating and sweating as if floating in the space together only a little faith remained The vast universe boundless fear ultimately cannot match the simplest primitive emotions and convictions how lucky we are who live day and night under the constraints of gravity,8
21 July 2015,"Beautifullly Told Story of Overcoming Odds, But Extremely Overrated",This story was well written There are a large amount of positives with this film But this film is shockingly overrated Maybe its because of some form of film patriotism from the U S George Clooney and Sandra Bullock Americas sweethearts As amazing as they were in this movie there is no way that this should have a meta score rating of 96 with however many hundreds of awards including 7 Oscars Fun fact Pretty well 90 of this movie is animated I am just in utter confusion as to why people find this amazing If you want a good space movie about overcoming odds go watch Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 This on the other hand is quite average With so much focus on the negative people may be wondering why i gave it a 7 out of 10 Well as i said before there are a lot of positives most of which are produced by the acting skills of Clooney and Bullock Nevertheless I don t think i would ever watch this movie ever again,7
17 February 2014,Two weeks ago the fake reviews brought me in.,A simple review for smart people without time Three weeks ago I M D B had this movie listed with an outstanding 9 4 rating over a one hundred 10 star ratings in a row i thought that was strange I saw the movie I was in SHOCK If you have half a brain about how space works you will hate this movie If you have respect for astronauts you will hate this movie If you prefer movies with plots you will hate this movie Has anyone seen a movie where someone runs down a middle of a road and gets run over by a car that is chasing them And you feel like turning the channel That is the feeling I had through 90 of the move It was hell because I was in the theater with 40 lost already DO NOT watch it I warned you Now that the spotlight has moved on its time to read the REAL reviews Someone got paid here I M D B LIES Read the reviews now after the paid reviewers are gone Sicking I no longer trust IMDb,1

15 December 2013,the whole story can be written in two lines,what happens is absolutely unscientific for those who know a thing or two about space this movie is torture from the start to the end the characters are unfinished and they don t match the reality of the situation the whole concept is flawed on the brighter side the visual effects are astonishing and mind boggling If they would have promoted this movie as a demonstration of most recent advances in visual effects I would have given it a ten but a movie should be more than its looks this movie doesn t have a soul Sandra Bullock s portrayal of an astronaut is laughable at best Clooney s character can be removed from the movie without having much of a consequence to the plot if you want to watch a movie which is stupid and pointless yet somehow entertaining this is for you otherwise don t bother,2
14 February 2014,90 glorious minutes in a roller-coaster of emotions,People were talking so much about how awesome this movie was So I had to watch to realize what they were talking about The trailer looked great showcasing a movie that actually cared about physics and mathematical stuff The thing is I didn t expect the movie to be so groundbreaking First of all I d like to congratulate Mr Alfonso Cuar n and team for the excellent piece of visual artwork that I have watched and damn these very same guys because this very piece of artwork made me shed some good tears and that don t happen since the first time I watched La vita Bela with Roberto Benigni The movie is short but the amount of realism is one of the shocking points of the movie The astrophysical board that worked in this movie actually cared A LOT about laws of physics This is one of the very few movies around where there s no sound in space People may find this declaration useless but it really matters and counts towards the experience Besides we have actual day cycles at space what gives a whole new dynamism to the scenes Let s talk about the visuals now The rendering of the spacescapes are gorgeous I ve never seen such detail in a CG work depicting the Earth as seen from the space in a movie The destruction of the space structures starting by the Explorer when the debris hit it is a mess in excruciating visual detail All that shrapnel and debris being thrown at your face looks f ing scary specially if you watch it in IMAX 3D As for the storyline it s not something too innovative but it s well designed and makes you not want to miss every scene and dialogue A few of them are in my opinion simply unique and believe me incredibly deep There are lots of scenes that make you think about yourself as a human and your role in this life a thing you wouldn t expect from this kind of a sci fi space survival movie About the cast actors go all natural like if they were actually long time friends but not letting go of the responsibilities of being a crew of a NASA Low Orbit mission Sandra Bullock s role was well executed by her and as for George Clooney while short we end creating emotional bonds with him and even getting some comical relief when hell breaks loose by the relationship of them both Phaldut Shama s appearance while really short is very joyful to witness Ed Harris as control is also nice to hear You would miss him a lot if comms were cut like in the movie I wanted to dedicate a paragraph for Mr Steven Price and his team The soundtrack of the movie is as short as it but every song is simply unforgettable Specially in the last scenes when my face became a river of tears The music fits like a silk glove in the hands of a queen with the atmosphere visuals and dialogues The aggressive sound of synthesizers combined with the strings add a whole dramatic tone to the impressive destruction scenes while the crescent serenity of the orchestra takes the relief and final scenes moon high making it just awfully perfect A wise choice as I believe not even Hans Zimmer Steve Jablonsky Zack Hemsey or Brian Tyler would do better I must say this movie may seem overrated but it is for a reason it s good It s punching strong and will make you leave the theatre with shaking hands and watering eyes I TOTALLY recommend this film as it s undoubtedly the best of the genre and deserves to be in IMDb s Top 20 90 minutes of pure tension anxiety reflection and a travel back home My vote for Gravity is a well deserved 9 2 10,9
28 December 2020,Little Sunday ride,The only thing which stands out in the movie is the visuals The story is pretty much predictable and even boring at times Performances are okay because these are great actors A few moments are really beautiful however with Sandra Bullock in the frame Music is good dialogues could have been improved or more specially when Sandra is all by herself,7
12 October 2013,The dance of beauty and thrill,The whole movie is a feast for the eyes especially if you re into space photography you d love the majestic Earth as the backdrop and the bokeh effects created here and there by the rising sun The plot was pretty neat and carried out with no glitches Some scenes might remind you of the movie Mission To Mars There are some scenes that would raise your heart beat to the speed of light Intense space drift thrill is coupled beautifully with the music The credits score at the end really deserves to be mentioned Sandra Bullock was at her best and George Clooney played his supporting role beautifully It really is amazing to see that our VFX has come so far this movie must get the appreciation it deserves with the Academy Award or for the VFX alone at the very least To sum up you d leave the theater with goosebumps for having embarked on this breath taking space odyssey,9
2 November 2013,Feel it...,With some 400 miles above looking at the oval shape of the earth seeing the sun rise and then the dark feeling the breathlessness when oxygen is low and a glass visor which you want to remove to breathe air Hung with just a string in space not even letting a small screw to be lost there and then deliberately releasing of the buckle so that the other can live you feel yourself also there being nowhere and then to find a thinnest ray of life and just holding on to it Yes we don t feel it when we walk but after seeing the movie you do say to yourself feel it gravity is there for you Direction is good with the entire movie revolving around a successful effort of a survival from literally impossible situation involving impossible but possible events and then ending again on earth with a hell of story to tell Do think that there are so many space missions going on from all the countries and there exists a possibility of what you see and then imagine that we humans have a lot of courage eagerness to take things on an adventure which is inside us may be gifted or may be induced to take the ultimate frontier space and with every passing day this quest is unfolding and it will keep on unfolding till the end of this world we may know some of it and some we can never know forever as there will be never a hell of a story to tell as the story might die with brave people who are the main character of that story,8

25 October 2013,'Gravity' is Sexist,Spoiler Alert This post will ruin the closest thing to a twist that Gravity has It s not a huge deal but if you haven t seen the movie and don t want any plot spoilers best to move along Sandra Bullock s character is the most panicky inept person ever sent into space It s never explained why a medical doctor with only six months of training is somehow adding equipment to the Hubble probably because there s no world in which this would happen Science fiction movies have certainly had more panicky people in space Bill Paxton in Aliens but Gravity isn t a science fiction movie It takes place in present times with present technology in space It s realistic fiction comparisons should be more to Apollo 13 than any sci fi For the first half of the movie Sandra Bullock basically has no agency and takes no useful action to save herself George Clooney unflappably holds her hand through every action and swoops in with his magic jetpack whenever she inevitably does something wrong She spends a good deal of time literally tethered to him as he does all the work By all appearances George Clooney s character would have survived the entire ordeal easily had he not been forced to frequently expend limited resources and take gigantic risks to save Sandra Bullock s damsel in distress The only back story for her character is how emotionally damaged she is because she is a mother who lost her child There s no screen time given to how awesome at her job she must be to have landed this incredibly rare and prestigious opportunity nor is any given to showing her being more competent than anyone else at any task she performs in the movie There is a point in the movie where she has given up all hope and just decided to die Rather than taking this moment for her to find the strength within herself to carry on she instead hallucinates George Clooney back into the picture to be Space Daddy and tell her exactly what she needs to do Whatever else you may think of Gravity don t think that it is doing a good job of portraying a strong female role It s the opposite This is just one more story reinforcing in catastrophic situations men are cool as cucumbers and women freak out and get emotional stereotypes Alfonso Cuar n may have fought to have a female lead in Gravity but having a female lead and having an admirable female character are two totally different things And now for some pre facto rebuttals The circumstances were unprecedented any man or woman could have panicked in that way That s true but not just anybody did The reference points we are given in the movie are the cool collected man and the panicky inept woman But ultimately she saves herself Yes but there s both the problem of hallucinating a man to tell her what to do and that we are never shown a single thing that she does that seems like it is better or different from what our male character would have done and he s only dead because of her Her inexperience was central to the tension of the plot it had to be this way I disagree This isn t Apollo 13 where we re recounting some historical actual space disaster This is a movie about everything in space blowing up There would have been tension and doubt as to her survival even if she were exactly as cool and collected as George Clooney So how should it have been then How about this just swap the roles Sandra Bullock or someone maybe a bit older plays the cool collected experienced astronaut who is paired with a rookie astronaut on his first mission This probably can t be George Clooney because I can t really imagine him playing a rookie or panicky anything How about Bill Paxton Who cares it s just a movie A movie that is garnering universal critical acclaim huge box office success likely award nods and is also talked up for having a female lead We re showering praise and success and reinforcing the idea that damsels in distress are a great way to tell stories I believe that media and entertainment hold immense sway over the attitudes and behaviours of our culture and I find it frustrating how few opportunities are seized to portray fantastic strong female characters especially in engineering or scientific roles The world needs more Ellen Ripleys not more Ryan Stones that s the character s name if you ve forgotten I had,1
4 October 2013,Gravity 5 *****,it doesn t disappoint visually this movie is as good as it gets just staring at our beautiful planet earth never ever gets boring gravity does a really impressive job showing the viewer that space is raw scary and can easily kill you the movie is a thrill ride where there is no up or down and what you do will propel you for all eternity IMO gravity is well worth the price of admission just to see it on a big screen in time this film will be used to show off that entertainment center you own cheers,10
31 October 2013,"Good movie, but not great movie, but great visuals",I just watched the movie this afternoon after all the reviews and the box office performance It s a good movie excellent even amazing visuals when seen in 3 D and the rebirth or the journey for birth allegory was nicely done but I still feel unsatisfied The movie has amazing visuals granted But what if the story had taken place in a jungle a woman lost and surviving or being re born in a jungle Or underwater or in a snowstorm or in the middle of Alaska etc My guess is it wouldn t garner all the praises it has so far received In the end it s great visuals and good allegory I m disappointed because I expected more If I rated this movie right after I watched it I d have given it a 6 10 but I ended up giving it an 8 It deserves it two main characters great visuals allegory and it exposes science to the masses But there are much better movies I ll tell you what though 90 minutes best in 3 D in shape lady dressed as sigourney weaver Clooney to attract the non science fiction geeks and voila more money for Hollywood It s like popcorn at the movies for 6 25 it s completely absurd but one of the greatest ideas ever,8
13 July 2019,VISUALLY STUNNING & BRILLIANT,First off I love this film From the opening scene to the last shot this film is worthy of a 10 10 for it s visuals I can not believe this was directed by the same man who made the dreadful Roma which i detest along everyone else i know who saw Roma I do not care about reputations or who the director is I just want to be entertained this kept me thrilled entertained Seen it in 3d first then upgraded to imax which made it even better I then watched it on my phone still love it lastly on dvd it is just as good on all formats which just proves how outstanding this film is Sandra Bullock pulled of an Oscar winning performance I simply can not fault Gravity 10 10,10
21 July 2018,(Outer space never seemed this threatening).,Gravity is for sci fi lovers it is for space lovers it is for anyone who wants to be awed by the brutal nature of outer space Amazingly shot by Mexican Alphonso Cuarran Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as an astronaut who suffers a problem in orbit and then must return back home any way possible The cinematography and direction is amazing and the shots of the planet are humbling and scary at the same time Of course I know all this is CGI but it looks so real you d be shocked George Clooney also stars but he s barely in the film Bullock is more than competent and carries the film though it is the visuals and the sequences of chaos that stay with you,8
16 October 2013,What a movie!,This one had me at the edge of my seat That hadn t happened for ages Do watch this one in 3D on the big screen it s much more effective that way The cast is small with Sandra Bullock taking up most of the movie in a film that basically has a cast of two putting aside some voices such as ones from Houston She copes with this burden beautifully What more can I say It compares favorably with 2001 A Space Odyssey in terms of isolation and space Ryan Stone and deadly space debris storms as compared to David Bowman and HAL A similar feel exists here It was a very memorable night out indeed for me,9

5 October 2013,A True Sci-Fi Movie,Its been such a long time to see a good science fiction movie without bringing down the realism through too many action scenes This one is different if u like movies like Moon 2009 2001 a space odyssey Solaris 2002 1972 then this movie is going to take your breath away I came to this movie for three names Cuaron Clooney Bullock and it pays Awesome visuals great camera work Especially the view from the helmet of the astronauts but the soundtrack was nowhere near Solaris 2002 but still it was decent enough And its not without its flaws though And last but not least watch it definitely in 3D,7
29 October 2013,Good and Bad,First I think Gravity was a pretty good movie but I don t think it will be good if you don t see it in its release on the big screens of the movie theater It s a simple but very dramatic story but on the other hand I was bored for a lot of it Way too much Sandra Bullock floating around I have never disliked Sandra Bullock nor have I been a big fan but in this it was just too much of her and I didn t think her performance was brilliant like some people obviously think won t be surprised if she ends up getting nominated for an Oscar because of all of the hype but I don t think she honestly deserves to win one for this performance good but not great George is too old to play an astronaut There I said it He s what like 60 years old and we are supposed to believe that NASA would send a man that age up into space At least that Clint Eastwood Donald Sutherland movie about old timers going into space was supposed to be a comedy Some great effects obviously But overall this movie is very overrated and just good but not great,5

9 July 2022,Slightly Hyped,There is better space films out there but there is also worse Stowaway It is no where near as good as interstellar though Regardless I feel people over hyped this because of the actors that were in it The acting however was phenomenal At least watch once for Sandra Bullock,5
29 June 2021,Should have been a Docu-series.,For me it got over too soon I wasn t left satisfied that I ve watched a movie that s been on my list for farr tooo long Felt like I completed a part of a docuseries It was more like oh that s the end I guess I d watch the movie again purely for its visuals Oh I held my breath a lot It s just beautiful All the other parts felt like somebody dreamt the whole story on Earth and had the budget to create a space movie Sandra Bullock and George Clooney played their parts well they made it seem realistic but something was just missing If you figure what it is let me know,7
11 October 2013,a film made for imax,Can t really find fault with anything in this movie it is done so so well i have no idea how they did the camera work but it is light years ahead of anything I ve seen in years I ve never really considered Sandra Bullock a great actor but after seeing this I am reconsidering And good for them to give her the lead role If you have a chance see this in 3 d As we all know 3 d is largely a big waste and a marketing ploy However it is used very well in this movie Highly recommended,9

8 February 2014,"Great movie, but may not be for everyone",Gravity was a very decent and suspenseful movie I have heard some complaints about the plausibility of something like this but I have to say that made no difference to me Bullock and Clooney do a very good job as this movie is heavily reliant on their emotions throughout the scenes There isn t much in the way of supporting cast or special effects to take the focus away from them hence the reason the movie is up for some many awards I couldn t really find a flaw with this movie per se other than the fact I found it a little slow at times I chalk that up to being one of those moviegoers that critics hate where I enjoy a fast paced BIG movie You have to remember going in that this is a movie where the main focus is going to be on two characters and so not much else goes on around them Bullock did a great job carrying the movie as she is the true star of the film She gets the majority of the screen time and does a great job going through the emotional roller coaster that is required for this role This would have been a very tough film to carry and much of the success is because of the way she portrayed the character and carried the film She ll likely win many awards for this movie Clooney plays the more experienced astronaut and his role is very important as far as motivating Bullock s character He does a great job but it felt a little bit like he was just playing himself to me I didn t really feel he was as in character as Bullock was Seems like he had some spare time so he decided to jump in All in all Gravity is a great movie but I think it s one of those movies that will win a bunch of awards and be forgotten in a year It s not going to appeal to every movie goer as it s more geared to showcase an actor s chops rather than appeal to a large broad audience It ll be loved by critics but not necessarily be for everyone,8
13 November 2014,Perfection,Incredibly ingenious To talk about the emptiness of space by making the most empty movie of the decade And let s not forget the audacious metaphor of the loose spaceship scraps as a clever mise en abyme of the actors themselves mere pieces of their old selves spiraling endlessly in the void their careers have become To be completely honest the ISS kinda saves the day here its performance as a damaged version of itself easily being the best piece of acting of the movie To sum it up staring at a plank for an hour and a half will bring you the same amount of excitation as this movie The benefit of choosing the plank over the movie is that a plank can serve a great deal of purposes So chose wisely,1
13 October 2013,"Do not watch this movie if you have a fear of heights or space,",I honestly didn t want to see this movie but once i heard it may be up for an Oscar we decided to see it and decide for ourselves I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan and she was really amazing in this movie I have a huge crush on George but he never calls Ha ha ha It was a really realistic movie to experience Please see it in 3D or Imax Two thumbs up If you don t like amusement park rides than don t see this movie in theaters because you feel everything they go through The music was great too and different This movie is a true thriller and i would suggest it for most movie goers It was a beautiful cinema experience that is like no other movie I know of and quite good and so entertaining,8

1 January 2014,Watch it - it is worth !,Space Silence These two terms are a perfect description of the movie You would think then there is no action in the movie that the movie is rather boring in general But you would be so wrong There is a lot of action Besides the happening which is shown perfectly regardless the methods technology or computer animation used there is an action or better to say quite a storm also in the main actors minds The first one seems very superficial and shallow however full of wisdom in the second character there is fight going on for which space as a scenery is perfect place to take A place of piece a place of silence to think about George is great his stories are macho alike yet behind this shell there is just a human who is scared and trying to convince the others he is not and vice versa showing he is respectful to space but brave enough at the same time even though only fictitiously Sandra is as usual perfect in her role She contributes her spice just in a sufficient quantity Her attractiveness is also not distracting you from the initial movie intention that is piece that her character deserves Dive in to Gravity you will not regret it,8
2 February 2014,Excellent and Stunning Visual effects,I checked out Gravity sometime last year and it left me confused by the time it got over Confused because there is no such plot in the film and you see Bullock in every scene for 70 of the movie Bullock is a fine actress but there is not enough material in this film Clooney is again charming at his best and has some good one liners but his character is killed off to soon However if u overlook what I said in the previous paragraph the movie is visually stunning As one critic said This is the closest to what we can see as space in our lifetime Cuaron and his team create a masterpiece of visuals and effects and in 3D it comes of superb The photography is outstanding and I was awe struck several times when I was seeing space The movie should win Oscars in the technical fields and Cuaron may pick up the Best Director trophy but story wise its disappointing,7
31 July 2022,A Space Thriller Missing Some Key Components,I wasn t really thrilled to watch a lady stuck in space for an hour and a half but Gravity pulled it off way better than what I thought it would Sandra Bullock did a great job as a space survivalist with barely any skill or knowledge to get back home George Clooney played a very enjoyable character One of my biggest problems with the movie is how many people died and while it did set a good stranded tone I found it a little depressing The visuals were very nice though even with most of the movie not being set on Earth I wish we had been able to see Houston s view on how they were working to get back to the main characters that was a missed opportunity in my opinion The Martian does a great take on that and it would ve been appropriate here too The ending was a little too abrupt for me But altogether I wouldn t call this a bad watch Especially given all of the intense thriller feels that the movie gives off,7
6 October 2013,Good But A Tad Over-hyped,Visually stunning but Claustrophobic I had the urge to walk out after 10 or 15 minutes not because it was bad but because you really do feel like you re in space And the director keeps you there with no earthbound cuts in the action Just the right amount of CGI which after the usual blockbuster overkill of things moving everywhere on the screen I appreciated You feel the vastness and silence of space and it s not someplace I want to be Not sure what folks are thinking about Sandra Bullock s performance being Oscar worthy She s good but not that good And Clooney is well vintage Clooney So I guess I m not recommending it but then again I was too busy trying to wish myself back on the ground Others obviously loved it,7

25 October 2014,Awful and boring!,The film was wretched It s awful boring and tiring they tried to do something like a documentary film but it turned out terrible What is the probability that it hits from the first which button should be pressed among the thousands of buttons that are written in Chinese so of course she can not understand And what is the probability that among the 70 sea water deep oceans and 29 of land that it just gets in the marsh which has saved her life because it is partially soft input and is deep enough to not falling through from the bottom and it is enough shallow that when it comes to the bottom so as not to drown because there is enough air to quickly reach the shallows if she fell in the sea protective suit as is made of metal dragged to the bottom of the oceans and being killed or from pressure differences or from drowning Another option is to fall on the land due to excessive speed just make it explode Very unrealistic film although they desperately tried to make film to be as realistic as possible,2
27 March 2022,Defy Gravity,This movie was unique in the way it s filmed The part of me that s still nauseous isn t sure that s a good thing but I imagine this was pretty amazing in theaters Gravity is a very simple film in terms of storytelling Most of the movie depends entirely on one character to carry it Overall it was fine but I m not sure it deserved a Best Picture nomination,7
28 July 2019,Excellent: 9.5,Many blockbusters no matter how good or bad they are rarely feel at all personal Gravity however is different It s a feat of technical wizardry of course but setting the film in space was quite possibly the only way for director Alfonso Cuaron to tell the story he wanted to tell Cuaron doesn t present space as a place of infinite possibility like Star Wars He doesn t define it by the danger it might hold like Ridley Scott did in Alien Instead he does something ingenious he uses space as a blank canvas a completely neutral background on which he paints his characters in vivid detail After a while the fact that the characters aren t even on Earth simply stops registering and elegantly gives way to various situations that test the astronauts capabilities to their limits Gravity is a remarkable achievement and one of the year s best There are more technically advanced movies in 2013 Some are also smarter But none have yet achieved such a perfect balance of the two,9
3 November 2013,"Stunning ""Gravity"" Pulls You In",Gravity is a thought provoking thrill ride that dazzles with the most stunning visuals since Avatar The moondust thin plot of two astronauts caught in a disaster who then desperately try to return to Earth does not grow wearisome with the lean mean 90 minute running time Stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are superb in what essentially amounts to a two person play a harrowing ballet set against the dark vacuum of space Final Rating 8 8 out of 10 http suchmovies com,9

16 April 2019,She got $10 mil for this crap!,I couldn t stomach this junk Her acting in her very first movie was better She is completely unbelievable in this movie I d rather watch grass grow than watch this junk,3
30 September 2013,Waterworld finally has some company,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen Waterworld you have competition The cinematography is wonderful everything else particularly the storyline is horrible The two main actors there is a third if you pay close attention faces are hidden from view most of the time by their helmets This isn t really such a bad thing Sandra Bullock was never a beauty but age has done her no favors George Clooney has aged somewhat more gracefully but he still comes off as an arrogant preppy who is still full of himself and thinks that he is God s gift to women admittedly many women seem to agree Save you money,
4 May 2014,Totally Breathtaking Cinema,Gravity 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuaron Life in space is impossible That s how it opens this quote and darkness and then we re sunning up to the majestic slow turning orb of the Earth rising up and out of us as if the screen has suddenly become a window on an alien and dangerous environment We can already hear the crackled voice of George Clooney and other astronauts and the pinprick of white against the endless dark soon resolves itself into a space shuttle This is a stella film not because of the stomach wrenching effects in Imax cinemas people were suffering vertigo and not because of the massive screen stars that are Clooney and Bullock This is such a powerful story because it understands its own theme and reverberates to it through every act Life in space is impossible And we are fools to try we are puny pathetic childish gods who think we can buck nature and the enormity of space humbles us utterly The effects are seamless so seamless that we don t notice them although 81 of the 90 minutes have been created digitally by the British company Framestore It is the story here that trumps all technical brilliance and there s that commodity in spades Sandra Bullock is excellent and it is the puniness of her one human life held up against the immense indifferent cold of space that begins to turn that opening theme into its antithesis Life in space is impossible but life for Dr Ryan Stone on Earth has been impossible too Her daughter died in a freak fall before the age of five and she is lonely grieving and lost Her marriage broke apart and she fell into her work Now lost in space after a cataclysmic event destroys her shuttle she must try to make it to the International Space Station to find a way back to Earth Space is silent space is pure action and reaction and we get some beautiful experiences of the Newtonian mechanics of colliding objects as the the swarm of deadly shrapnel that destroyed the shuttle orbits the Earth again and again lacerating Stone s other chances of survival Life in space is impossible yes but Stone survives against the odds giddy from lack of oxygen giddy on still being alive and locked in the capsule of the space station Clooney manages to get her to before he bows out she spins in the foetal position truly alive perhaps for the first time in years This is transformative incredible cinema adventure drama and deadly beauty in such a breath taking package you ll need to take travel sickness pills Of course it s had all of the plaudits and Oscars and sparkling reviews a virtually unheard of 97 on Rotten Tomatoes for example But the reviews are all true space without the terror and stomach churn of going there and what is so poignant and clever is that out there in a place where life is impossible we discover that no of it matters the politics the petty nonsense and that what we have our mortal puny lives is the single most unifying thing that binds us Life is possible here and only here Gravity pulls us to our home gravity holds us here and within its thrall we have the glorious opportunity to truly appreciate what a wonder being here at all is You need to see this film ideally at the cinema if you can bear it at an Imax Probably best not buy popcorn in the foyer though Five stars,10
22 February 2021,Dull Movie,This move was hyped a lot when it fist came out Great special effects but it wasn t enough It fell short of the hype Character development was nonexistent and there was zero chemistry Story line was beyond weak,4
9 June 2014,I Am Amazed!!!,Gravity is a terrific fun and exciting film It is visually stunning and is a true nail biting suspense story It was along with Mud my favorite film of 2013 All of the acclaim Gravity received was well deserved I saw it on the big screen and felt like I was trapped out there with her Who would have thought that a movie about a person trapped in space could be so thrilling Just when one obstacle was overcome another one or a dozen would appear I was on the edge of my seat for the entire time and was infinitely entertained That s what a good movie is all about isn t it I would definitely call Gravity a modern science fiction classic I think Gravity will hold up for many decades to come Kudos,10
21 October 2013,Highly over rated,I really think this movie is doing well simply because there is nothing else to see at the movies and at least this movie is visual Had this movie run when better movies were playing at the same time Gravity would be considered a dud It feels like the movie deleted key parts of the script like the beginning We really learn very little about the main character and George Clooney s character basically is a wisecracking astronaut with bad stories who flies around a lot in his space suit Sandra Bullock plays this part very well but at 50 years old perhaps a younger actress would have made more sense The movie is very visual and it has some great shots However quite a bit is not plausible and simply would not happen so don t look for accuracy Don t expect much and you ll like it but it really doesn t deserve the hype,2

27 May 2014,A Newtonian ballet of epic thematic proportions.,Believable characters with an effective but minimal plot allows tone pacing and atmosphere to rule over Sandra Bullock s performance ties Gravity to earth making what could have been Avatar surprisingly emotional An all but technically perfect film Gravity shows the glory of cinema s future whilst paying homage to the greatness of the past a truly transcendent experience Visual metaphors symbolism and allegory are present throughout giving a rich thematic and even philosophical depth to Gravity for those with open enough eyes to see Many people complain about the few sparse scientific inaccuracies and forgotten that they aren t watching a NASA IMAX movie which is itself a testament to the visual wonderment that Gravity is Also in case no one knows yet superheroes aren t real and cars don t change into robots in real life Alfonso Cuaron s signature sustained shots force the viewer to not break away no film has ever done immersion quite like Gravity before You hear the word awesome thrown around a lot nowadays but Gravity was the first ever film which truly struck awe into my spine Yet at the heart of Gravity is a deeply human story about accepting not only death but life,10
16 February 2014,It's a shame that it is nominated for the Oscar's,I agree with many comments here that the movie has a really weak and stupid plot really artificial It feels like watching Final Destinations in Space Only that the Final Destinations series had more characters and more interesting and grabbing plots I thought that the Oscar s was a serious award for professionals Well the fact that this movie is nominated demonstrated its lack of credibility I have to wonder what s behind the scenes in Oscar nomination Could be a lot of money favor driven deals I don t blame the movie Every year thousands of stupid movies are produced I blame the Oscar s While maybe I took them too seriously Sandra Bullock s acting was good However there is a limit what you can do in a shallow plot Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine had the most impressive performance in 2013 In fact it s one of the most memorable performance in years,4

28 February 2014,"Great visuals, okay plot",Gravity I just watched this on my computer It was in fact my first ever downloaded movie from the Internet I guess this is now the wave of the future what with Blockbuster being out of business though I will still miss going to the video store and browsing through thousands of movie selections often not having a clue in advance as to what movie I was going to rent Anyway on to the movie Visually it s great and probably its best feature by far The effects are so good you don t even notice they re effects it looks like they actually shot this movie in real outer space As for the rest The best I can say is the story is competent For those who don t know it s about two people stranded in space after debris from several exploded satellites has taken out their space shuttle didn t the filmmakers know the Shuttle is now retired They are literally marooned with just their space suits for protection The question then is can they get to a nearby space station in this case Chinese in order to find a capsule that can take them safely back to Earth The plot makes some technical errors but you can mostly ignore those and just enjoy the drama and the great visuals There s no need to spoil the plot since there isn t much of one Either they get back to Earth or they don t Sandra Bullock does I think a pretty decent job although she really doesn t come across as a real astronaut but more like a Damsel in Distress set in space Although she s competent enough when she has to be she s much too emotional most of the time to look like someone who s gone through the rigorous training and psychological screening given to real astronauts And Clooney isn t really acting at all he s just playing himself wise cracking obviously thinks he s God s gift to all women etc only he s doing it in a space suit This has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture Will it win Should it win On the first I doubt it since space Sci Fi movies almost never win Best Picture Stanley Kubrick s 2001 didn t and it s much better than this film nor did any of the Star Wars flicks Should it win Probably not The amazingly lifelike visuals again they really look like they re in space but then so did most of 2001 and that was filmed in 1968 simply can t make up for a pedestrian plot 7 10 mainly for the amazing visual effects,7

24 April 2018,Better than a lot of the violent sci-fi,I grant this there are a lot of inaccuracies But I enjoy this movie anyway Do I think that they could have done better with the physics and placement of things Sure But it is an attempt to do sci fi without the need for villains and fighting There are a lot of possibilities for sci fi stories which deal with things other than warfare This is an example of such a story as flawed as it is The sequencing of the events are done in a way which I find easy to forgive the missteps It s also nice that the sounds outside of the music is mostly what the person would hear rather than the overused sounds in space which are usually heard And I think that the soundtrack was quite good,7
26 October 2013,"Gravity, one of the best of the year",Gravity is mind blowing in every aspect Gravity takes us out of the seat and carries us afloat on a ninety minutes journey across outer space The scientific realism given to the film is simply unique and very rare around today s movie industry It is beautiful to see Cuar n deliver such a nice realistic experience that combined with the appealing visuals and pumping sounds transports viewers to another dimension entirely distinct from the physics people are used to on Earth As a science man and particularly as a fan of astronomy and all the fascinations the cosmos gives I found myself wondering about human existence on Earth after watching the movie in 3D Months in advance I ve created high expectations for Gravity Surely Cuar n and Bullock achieved that with great effort Her acting was superb Particularly her breaths were perfectly timed with the scenes and emotions and really transpires the difficulties undertaken on gravity less environments Astronauts are real heroes This one deserves Oscar nominations I rate it ten out of ten,10

2 April 2014,Not worth an Oscar nomination,Gravity does not deserve to have any Oscar nominations Did someone only put them in that category because George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were in it I mean seriously Not only does the movie lack a plot there are so many things that are unbelievable Granted they chose to do it in space which means 99 of the population have never been and can t relate to it More so I can t stand watching a 1 person movie did they really need to hire a world class actor like George C to be in the movie for no more than 10 minutes That just seems ridiculous If he was going to die might as well get some random stand in guy to fill in the part This whole movie was completely hyped up Of course the graphics were good but that doesn t really make it a good movie at all Overall this movie was over hyped unrealistic and pretty dull,4

24 March 2014,Awful,The film Gravity is awful because The dialogue between the characters is unrealistic The characters themselves are unrealistic You find yourself wondering why the lead character was allowed on the mission in the first place Then the real problems start The physics is all wrong ALL OF IT The film is so heavily based around bastardised physics that it becomes unwatchable The reason for this is that most of the events which occur in the film would never occur in real life This film is supposed to be a thriller drama realistic horror Yet it can be neither of these things There is no realism in terms of the characters their interaction between one another the geography of space or the science upon which the whole film is based The lack of realism in a film that depends on it for its narrative and genre means that it loses all credibility and thus fails altogether Also why call a film Gravity when as far as the astronauts are concerned there is effectively none of it Indeed my repulsion to this film is far stronger than the micro gravity that wouldn t be experienced by the astronauts because it would be too small to notice One can only presume that they subconsciously called it gravity on account of how weak it is It is afterall the weakest of the forces Which is why Starwars is so much better,1

20 June 2015,Excellent and Unique,Refreshing out of the box different movie not the same clich style film soundtrack works wonders for this film 1st time i watched it i enjoyed it and understood most of the small details after viewing the 3hrs of extras and watching it again made the movie so much more enjoyable Small subtle details and the reasons behind them gave the movie much more depth meaning and feeling Action movie without the loud bang bang shoot em up music and sounds This movie is like a great book A new favorite For all you unhappy with this 90 min movie is because you have no imagination or cant express emotion or feeling and hide behind technology texting or blogging Unable to converse with society face to face and follow like sheep when you only read 1 review thats at the top of the list spend the time and watch movies regardless of everyone else s opinions good or bad If you are an individual that watches movies based on friends or families reviews then you might as well just jump of that bridge because everyone else is and follow like sheep,10

15 November 2014,Excellent Visual but almost no script,The movie has got wonderful visual that we perhaps never seen in a movie We should remember while watching a sci fi movie that science is just a part of it or may be I can say it s give an inspiration to storytellers to start a story There has been a lot of scenes in the movie which just doesn t make sense if you have studied some high school level physics But surely it will an awesome experience for those who just want to enjoy the visual of the movie Besides the science there should have been more stuffs in the story Basically there is no story in Gravity Ryan and Matt found themselves working in space centre and debris started hitting rest of the crew died and Ryan got a working space shuttle and came back to earth There is nothing more in the movie But still I feel to rate it 8 10 because of the way of Alfonso Cuar n presented the movie He has already delivered few of the memorable movies of last decade which includes Y tu mam tambi n and Children of Men There will be mistakes in a movie while depicting physics Alfonso Cuar n is not a physicist he is a person from art To imagine the a movie in gravity less space for a person from art is so difficult that there are not a lot of Gravity alike movies We can t do many things in space like we can t cry even if we cry the tears won t flow out of our eyes We won t simply thrown away from a space ship as there will be a little bit of gravitational force between the huge spaceship and tiny 60Kg human beings But if Sandra Bullock would not have been crying how will the filmmaker show bring the emotion in the movie There was a real need of Geroge Clooney s comeback because Ryan was loosing all her hope to go back to earth There was a real need of Geroge Clooney s comeback because Ryan was loosing all her hope to go back to earth,8
9 July 2014,Visually: Amazing. The rest... Garbage.,This movie was so stupid I cannot believe it was actually made It was an amazing movie in terms of visuals but the storyline plot and dialogue were absolutely atrocious Honestly this movie would be better if George Clooney and Sandra Bullock s characters were replaced with monkeys and there was no dialogue Personally I am not a fan of either Clooney or Bullock but I decided to give it a chance since they have been good in a couple of movies i e The Men Who Stare at Goats and Murder by Numbers I know a number of people will disagree with me on this but this is just my opinion I didn t enjoy this movie and when I finished watching it I could not believe what I had just seen It was even worse than Vanishing on 7th Street,1

12 October 2019,Could've been a hell of a story to tell,The movie is not bad Good drama and sci fi But maybe they could ve add some more ingredients to make it more spicy I can t call it a slow movie like some reviews suggest overall it s pretty nice film But I have to say it s a little overrated I mean this is no way near as good as Interstellar 2014 But still a very good try they just missed to achieve the tag of WOW,6

13 August 2023,"""You've got to learn to let go.""",Gravity 2013 is a 7x Oscar winning space thriller starring Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone and George Clooney as Matt Kowalski depicting the multitudinous struggles of astronauts Stone and Kowalski as they desperately attempt everything they possibly can to make it back to Earth after a satellite in orbit is mistakenly destroyed by the Russian space force and fragments of it travelling at incredibly high speeds tear through the protagonists shuttle seemingly their one and only hope for survival and for a way back home Now that is how you make a space movie Right from the very beginning you are hooked in with a hammering score quickly followed by some of the most breathtaking visuals you will perhaps ever see from an outer space film And I mean literally I found myself gasping for air after not even 5 minutes of laying my eyes on this absolute spectacle I knew there and then that I was going to be giving this a 10 10 as it could only get better from then on in and oh boy it certainly did I ve seen people say that the story and the script are both appallingly weak but to be honest those comments take me by complete shock as I thought they were utterly incredible When it comes to the plot I have to say I never expected such twists turns and I absolutely loved how they captured that feeling of despair hopelessness that you would indeed feel in that situation in all its essence I genuinely believed at times that there was seriously no way out for the protagonists that they were doomed so that is a testament to just how real this movie felt When it comes to the script whilst I will admit that it is clearly flawed for the most part it really holds its own as it was highly emotive and powerful Also the sound design was astounding definitely the best I ve ever heard from a space feature The use of silence along with moments of loudness was exceptionally done with such expertise 100 deserving of its Oscars for Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing As a matter of fact all 7 of its Academy Awards were thoroughly merited including Best Director Alfonso Cuar n seriously should get the biggest round of applause for his work here I cannot imagine this film being executed any better Overall this is genuinely one of the best movies I have ever seen I cannot believe I hadn t watched this sooner I only wish I could ve had the experience of seeing this on the big screen I would recommend this picture to anybody who s at least willing to give this genre a go as it exceeded my own expectations by a light year,10
7 September 2021,Dumbest piece of garbage I've ever seen,This movie was a complete waste of my time and energy to watch it There were so many factual errors it is totally unbelievable Don t waste your time watching this waste of film,1
20 December 2014,Mixed feelings,MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS READ AT OWN RISK Okay first of all the visual effects are STUNNING Beautiful And the acting was spectacular as expected I was looking forward to this one I knew it was going to be a good one with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in it But I was greatly disappointed 3 words Boring Aggravating Disappointing I rented it with my brother and we didn t even watch it halfway We turned it off and watched something because with the exception of the visual effects it was very boring We couldn t get into it The aggravating part was Sandra Bullocks character We watched her make the STUPIDEST decisions which ultimately ended with consequences We just sat there yelling at the screen and very upset I have to praise the actors and the special effects team though for their major success All in all I ve never finished it and most likely never intend to But I can t speak for everyone Some people may get it But I didn t,5
5 June 2022,Terrible,How in the world did this movie get these astounding reviews I honestly cannot believe it I watched it a couple times to be certain that if you want to see a well done space film watch First Man or even Apollo 13 Gravity has unrealistic physics movement and bad CGI on top of just being a plain boring movie Not recommended at all,2
18 February 2014,Vacuous - just like space,What really perplexes me is how many people liked this movie That it is nominated for Best Movie of the year well I am stunned and have lost respect for the people who nominate movies for these awards The entire movie is a puerile string of calamities and relies entirely on Sandra Bullock s superb acting skills The story There isn t one really It is a glitzy 3D orgy with a great actress and lame script nothing more How do I know the script is so empty well watch the movie in 2D and you will get the message pretty quickly There is no story it s like a long boring computer game where one mishap after another besets you and you have to do your best to survive The moments when Sandra B realises she will probably die and she begins hallucinating are smattered with trite philosophical drivel absolutely not credible and seemed to pander to low brow masses I did not see any of the 3D effects which were probably fantastic A movie HAS to be a lot more than the quality of the effects it throws at you to cover the lack of depth plot anything at all that challenges or reveals something There was none of that worth watching or hearing Sadly this was a disappointing waste of 100m with some fantastic acting on a mediocre script,3

16 October 2013,The BEST Movie of the year!!!!,First off let me just say that I have a slight fear of being in space This movie didn t exactly help with that In fact I had an anxiety attack no joke at the start of the film This movie is EXTREMELY suspenseful and will make you hold on to your seat fearing that you will drift away This movie has great acting and AMAZING CG If this movie doesn t get an award for best picture I m going to flip my t If you do choose to see this movie see it in 3D Even if you hate 3D see it with friends and don t eat anything during the movie The movie is extremely quiet and is often completely silent at times Hearing chip packets during these scenes ruins the atmosphere and makes you want to tell that person to shut the f k up This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and is now in my top 5 best movies ever 10 10,8
6 June 2021,Best ever Space survival movie...,Marvelous brilliant concept It s probably the best film on Space fiction The visual effects are stunning People who love to watch science fiction movies they shouldn t miss it One of the best movie I ve ever watch in my life,10
1 November 2013,Gravity is why cinematography was invented.,Magic cinematography awesome soundtrack you re projected into space and there is not one second that you doubt it The storyline Simple but it makes you think aboout life and seeing the magnificent space all around you makes you think about what a small spec of dust we all are in the grand scheme of things no human story is grander that the vastness of space or spaces multiverse I saw it seven times in IMAX 3D I m on the track of seeing it 10 times It s a must for all you space freaks out there It s the best space movie ever because of the cimenatics cinematography and awesome sounds IMAX 3D is a must No black mysterious and unprobable box like in Space Odyssey 2001 here Even though Hal was great this is better,10

16 January 2014,I Don't Understand The Hype...,This movie looks great that is true it looks wonderful oh yes showing off extensive CGI of space oh yes its revolutionary Hold on No It isn t The movie does look great and I feel like most people are giving it huge praise for that praise maybe rightfully deserved However the minute anyone calls this new or revolutionary is about the time anyone who doesn t plaster all their expectations and enjoyment solely on visuals should stop listening I m a huge fan of sci fi and space I wanted to enjoy this movie though I questioned the over hyped cast and shameless showcasing of CGI I went into it with an open mind But it wasn t long until I discovered a lot of what I originally expected something I like to call Avatar syndrome Referring to a film that distracts people with lovely effects and visuals which cover up a pi poor story full of clich s laden with cheesiness Take away the great effects and everyone would notice what this movie is bad Just bad Predictable characters lacking anything unique whatsoever Sandra Bullock is the rookie that messes up to unbelievable lengths which adds another element to the movie just how unrealistic it is that a person as incompetent as that would get anywhere near the space program And of course George Clooney playing the same character he is cast as 90 of the time a care free hot shot lady s man who always knows what hes doing Its unimaginative and is just a survival disaster movie Also moving on to how this movie is supposedly revolutionary Am I missing something We ve known how to showcase space in movies since the 60s 2001 A Space Odyssey Ever heard of that Or how bout Alien Do I have to bring in Star Wars I understand this is different technology that we re talking about but really It s unimpressive and it pushes the dogma that extensive CG can distract audiences from a lazily written garbage plot Looks good but is unimpressive predictable and clich as all hell,3
1 April 2014,Great movie. Thoroughly enjoyable!,I think most of the bad reviews are from people who ve watched this in the theater Because the movie has a slow pace It s a much better movie when seen sitting on your couch at home Or probably because it was hyped by the marketing department Also I don t know if the guys who dwelled on the nitty gritty science bits know this Hollywood is in the business of entertainment not in creating scientific TV shows Anyways I really enjoyed the movie Considering that it s just two characters the movie was quite gripping And also I was full of awe seeing the inside of the space stations the space walking the dangers and sheer feeling of fear that if anything happens to you in space there s no one to help you The pictures of the earth with the clouds the cyclones the aurora was fascinating Wonderful entertainment Really enjoyable,9
13 May 2020,Not perfect,The picture is slightly new But it is not as good as Prometheus in terms of magnificence In the silent vacuum various sound effects are full of annoying More than 20 years have passed since the Cold War and the Russian missiles satellites and vodka are still conscientiously appearing everywhere in Hollywood movies where they are needed,7

4 January 2014,Technically Remarkable,The most remarkable movie of 2013 especially on the technical front It was not a movie but an experience People who have missed it on IMAX have truly missed to view how far have we come and what is possible today Completely women centric role kudos to Sandra for her superb performance Undoubtedly there have been many space related movies before but this one stands out because for the first time you can actually feel the remotest proximity to a real life experience in space the lack of gravity The sights the sounds or the lack of it and how it all matters when things do go wrong I could imagine that some think it is a bit far fetched for they have covered a domino of accidents and a real life astronaut may find it nightmarish But it is for sure thrilling to watch,10
7 July 2021,Well made movie,If you look only surface and estethichs Otherwise plot is actually quite hollow Astronauts with that kinda mental problems wouldn t probably get to space at all Not even talking about how she failed all simulator flights It isn t even close to scientifical accuracy Space just don t work like that Hubble and space stations aren t on same orbits at all So manuver to other space station from ISS and Hubble would be extremely difficult and it would require much more fuel and time If you know even little bit about orbital mechanics this movie would be pretty much impossible If space trash goes on different orbit that you orbit you wouldn t even see it at all Why did Russia even shoot their satellite I wanted to like more it but as space nerd it little bit impossible Overall it isn t that good movie actually,7
13 November 2013,Life-changing,This film to put it simply is life changing to say it is a masterpiece would not be giving it the credit it deserves I am in awe of the people that made this film possible I have never taken the time to write a review about a film before but I feel if I didn t it would be an insult Sandra Bullock s performance literally left me lost for words I can say without reservation or regret that this is the best film I have ever seen I think I may possibly be lost for words for days If you are reading this and wondering whether or not to go see this film everyone should see this film,10
13 December 2013,a breathtaking visual journey but oddly impersonal,the film is a very sensual experience Cuar n is careful to put us up there with the astronauts seeing everything from their perspective looking so good the visual aspect is nothing to complain about the film is relentless in delivering wonderful really meaning it elicits wonder sequences one after the other it keeps you mesmerized and fixated on the suspense that ceases not to arise along the ride however in between all of the wondrous and sensory pleasing input therein lies my issue with the film given the fact that it is almost entirely set in outer space the film is able to let space become a character of its own and it does that to good effect portraying its majestic beauty and its cruel indifference but not quite enough it seemed to me that the film s determination to continue building thrill caused it to lack depth and ultimately miss out on other interesting characteristics of space such as the idea that floating out of Earth above most things puts in perspective just how much we belong to or better are one with the universe opening up a range of exciting and curious existential musings and uncertainty in the final scene i felt that any intended allusions to the evolution of life crawling out of the sea onto the land is undeserved the result is a breathtaking journey and a distinctive visual experience with an oddly impersonal significance that leaves it slightly limping,7
31 December 2013,Lost in the mysterious beauty of space,GRAVITY directed by the Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron from a script by Cuaron in collaboration with his son Jonas Cuaron is a luminous film with fine performances by Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone a Bio Medical Engineer on her first outing into outer space accompanied by George Clooney as the veteran wisecracking Astronaut Matt Kowalski who is her guide on this mission working outside the shuttle Explorer trying to fix the Hubble Telescope Soon the idyllic beauty and silence of the deep blackness which was only punctuated by soft far off sounds of the other crew members is threatened by debris rushing at them from a Russian Satellite test gone awry Suddenly the heavenly environment has changed from peaceful quietude to thundering menace What happens to these two protagonists when they are stranded two specks in the vast universe separated from any contact with Mission Control contributes to the intensity and apprehension that we feel witnessing their dilemma Cuaron s spectacular visuals heighten our awareness of the isolation of Stone and Kowalksi drifting in the infinite sublimity and mystery of outer space tethering it to the existential detachment and solitariness that we experience as mortals Through the breathtaking cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki we view images of the Earth as seen from a Space station the rising of the sun the topography of lands and water masses that become abstract faraway places of light and texture The special effects in this movie are astonishing From the balletic slow spinning dance of the two actors choreographed so that the weightless movement of objects float around them in continuous motion dizzying but slowed down enough so we can observe without getting dizzy ourselves to the interior of the intricate space modules with gadgetry that is continually buzzing and flashing incomprehensible flickering flares reinforcing our sense of dread I loved the cinematic moments when there was an absence of sound periodically interspersed with Steven Price s music I wished there had been less dialogue which was often inane and flippant piercing the delicacy of the mood Dr Ryan Stone loves the silence but regrettably we do get the talky joking Matt Kowalski the regular guy with a sacrificial heart of gold chattering away bringing us out of our reverie and back down to earth Perhaps that was the intent of Alfonso Cuaron as life both in the cosmos and on terra firma are a mix of the transcendent and the commonplace,7

27 October 2013,I ended up liking this movie,I went to the movie expecting to be board for the first little bit i was quite board but once it got into it i was more and more into it to the point were i was thinking come on you can get it go go go grab it so yes it ended up being a good movie it was like no other movie in the respect it was an actual lost in space movie which would be anybody s worst nightmare just floating around yuck you could feel the fair and anxiety with Sandra Bullock the trailers i feel make it seem boring my thoughts from the trailer was oh man this is going to be so boring a couple of people floating in space how could this be a thriller but was impressed with what they did It is defiantly worth the watch,6

28 November 2013,Hollywood in space? No thanks.,I felt compelled to watch this movie due to the good reviews I can only say that having watched the movie the only reason you re likely to enjoy it is if you fall into one of the following two categories A You have a below average IQ B You become mesmerised by the setting sound track and visuals but simultaneously forget what actually makes a good movie The storyline and script was so weak my brain almost shut down at times Bullock s character was so annoying I ended up wanting to slap her and really Clooney in space There was no logic either the whole thing was so unbelievable I found myself laughing out loud at how preposterous it got on more than one occasion Which begs the question how on earth did this movie gain a rating of over 8 Personally I came out feeling robbed of both cash and valuable time My roommate felt the same,2
14 October 2013,"""Gravity""",Gravity is the story of two people who find themselves marooned on that most desolate of desert isles outer space Alfonso Cuaron who wrote along with his son Jonas Cuaron and directed Gravity is unarguably one of the best in the business and by adding Gravity to a list including the impressive Y Tu Mama Tambien and Children of Men shows himself to be one of the most versatile as well Unlike the other two which deal with relationships between in one case humans and in the other societal forces Gravity is about the interaction between one person and the void of outer space in other words nothing Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a medical researcher and space newbie is visiting the ISS for the purpose of some experiment or other We re never told what it is but that doesn t matter Matt Kowalski George Clooney is a veteran space man and apparently Stone s minder and affable tour guide on this seemingly routine mission Other than a voice from Houston they are the only characters in the film but make no mistake about it this is Bullock s show and in large part a one person show It s a risky place for an actor or a director to go if it fails it fails miserably The dialogue must be authentic the pacing needs to be spot on and action sequences must be perfectly placed to keep the audience s attention and break up the monologue in the right places and Cuaron with the exception of a few lines of dialogue gets it right There are no draggy bits begging to be over with There is no voice over interior monologue in Gravity all of Ryan Stone s thoughts are spoken and that can be heavy burden to bear It s always exciting to see an actor successfully step out of their comfort zone and that s what Bullock does in Gravity She s frequently played fish out of water characters before an alcoholic in 28 Days an undercover cop beauty queen in Miss Congeniality and an inspiring rebellious Dallas suburbanite in Blind Side But here she is not only outside societal norms It appears she is a wounded loner back on earth and besides that not many people go to outer space but outside the realm of humanity generally What there is of unspoken introspection is provided by Matt Kowalski s dialogue Clooney plays Kowalski perhaps a bit over the top Although we expect supreme competence from an astronaut he is at times too calm too chatty coming off as comfortable and cheerful floating around in space untethered to the space station as he would be at a backyard barbecue But that s okay he s there mostly as a foil against which Bullock works Not to mention Clooney is an exceedingly likable actor and listening to his for the most part one sided banter provides some much needed subtle comic relief from the tension and sense of chilling helplessness Gravity is essentially a thriller and like most thrillers everything is going along just fine until something goes terribly awry and the protagonist is called upon against dread and self doubt to rise to the occasion In this case Stone and Kowalski find themselves stranded in outer space not in the space station mind you but floating around in space suits without any communication with Houston and a good distance from the space station One of the most refreshing things about Gravity is Cuaron s use CGI It s unnoticeable seamless and he avoids falling into the pit of a CGI fest like almost every other director who has access to a computer seems to do He strives for an accurate portrayal of the space environment and does it elegantly Even the casual science geek could fine some implausibilities and downright violations of the laws of physics but they are minor and more than made up for by what the film gets right and it s feel of authenticity It truly seems like these two are in outer space Besides much of what Jason Bourne could pull of with a broken cell phone and candy wrapper stretches notions of possibility as well and that doesn t seem to bother us too much Gravity is so much more than hyper drive spaceships photon torpedoes and Death Stars It examines the depths of what it means to human and just where our place in the universe may or may not be In spite of its plot driven structure it deserves a place right up there with some of the best and smartest outer space films films like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Moon Films like these are not science fiction they are human truth plumbing the human soul rather merely telling a fantastical story Perhaps it is something about being so far removed from the home where we evolved that causes us to wax existential The distinction is that whereas those two ask the basic existential question who are we on behalf of all humanity Gravity is about one person asking herself the question who am I and do I want to persist in this human life in a world so far beyond human scale and answers it But perhaps that distinction between the films is not valid maybe they are the same question,8
9 November 2013,A visual masterpiece YES a Storytelling masterpiece NO,Once in a while you see a movie like Gravity for which you are tempted to write your own review I went to see the movie after admitting seeing such a good reviews out here Reviews made me feel its a Space Odyssey for our generation a masterpiece not to be missed So i landed up in theatre as its almost 4th week now 3D usually is not for me but after seeing Life of Pi i had change in view And 3D is what makes this movie spectacular Coming to the plot which is simple that two astronauts have to survive a catastrophe and they were none other than Sandra Bullock and George Clooney casting couldn t be better The film starts slowly but before you even familiarize with the characters the debris arrives you don t feel a bit for those poor astronauts who die because simply you do not know them Not even one bit I believe the director rushed on to the plot and could have made it more humane but in contrast we don t even familiarize with main characters and before we know it we are left with clooney and sandra Some people are mentioning she deserves an Oscar but in my opinion there is hardly any scene where she has done her best And its probably due to lame dialogues and very artificial situations The good thing i found was end scene where the Title of the story is justified You can feel the love and joy that can be felt when you land on the planet and walk on it after being in space and struggling to get hold on anything So its a must watch but surely not something totally out of this world,9

30 November 2013,This one will definitely take your breath,And the Oscar goes to This is an AMAZING end to end movie Everything is superb Bravo to all the casts voices special effects team CGIs are stunning and above all Alfonso they all did a wonderful job I think that Alfonso made it really hard on future directors to bring as a wonderful space movie one as this one It is REAL I can t remember ever being attached into a movie so completely and thoroughly and I don t think I ve seen a more beautiful film Its a pretty intense 90 minutes I m really amazed of the other negative reviews you really need to give this one a great chance Actually I usually hated 3D movies I don t like to wear that stupid glass they give me awful headaches and I don t see the point of them With Gravity I absolutely changed my mind This movie is absolutely stunning from the get go I can t remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly and I don t think I ve seen a more beautiful film Its a pretty intense ninety minutes with Bullock s character constantly battling one catastrophe after another and all of it is amazing to see,9
21 March 2016,Terrible,I admittedly do not have the patience of Job but I did stick this one out to the end It was very painful I am a big fan of Bullock and a lesser one of Clooney although I enjoy knowing that I can usually expect a pretty good performance from him but still a fan Right from the start I knew I was going to be challenged by the non stop hyperventilating of Sandra I have a Belgian Malinois that came with a hereditary hyperventilation defect She like Sandra in this movie pants like she has just ran a marathon all the time The difference here being that the dog can t help it Then there s the action part of the film There were only two actions For the whole movie Get to the space station and get back to earth So for an hour and a half we had to listen to Sandra hyperventilate The script was lightly peppered with a smidgen of concern panic and introspective release But that was it Awful and well beneath the talents of both of these great actors,1

26 September 2014,A visual success,Gravity doesn t boast of its unique story Dozens of this type have been done before but what makes Gravity different is the spectacular thrill showcased within a breathtaking scenery The movie may be filled of clich s but I will forgive it if only to acknowledge the world it has created The viewers are drawn to feel the characters it gives you the spirit and feeling of being on outer space yourself You feel their feeling because of its precise effects You put yourself in their shoes you hold your breath you feel dying I personally felt that And this is something not every movie can achieve Some movies feel like they really are just movies made for screen but Gravity made it feel like reality like I was there myself Some scientific aspect are questionable but again forgivable That s the tremendous effect of drawing the viewers within the world Gravity has created they forget science because the thought of surviving is just all that matters And Sandra Bullock perfectly portrayed and delivered this the anxiety panic fear of death she was perfect,
8 October 2013,Special effects never felt so real.,Let me start off I didn t get to see the movie in 3D devastating I know but I was still able to absorb the glistening and awe inspiring visuals even in classic 2D There are an abundance of films that are special effects orientated out there today and quite a few use CGI without realizing that they are taking away depth and story away from the film CGI and film always coincide with each other in balancing out story and effects This film however had no problem with that everything from the subtle P O V shots of earth to objects colliding in this film seemed to vividly jaw dropping from start to finish every bit of the film consisted of CGI but yet it felt so organic I felt as if I was within the drama weightlessly floating in space with only oxygen and a space suit Space never felt so enthralling yet so isolated and by the time it was over those 90 minutes felt more like a heartbeat I can t give any of the plot away because any giving of information other than the visuals of the movie would give away this compendious plot that being said it still works wonderfully with the CGI this whole movie essentially enshrouds itself in Well if you haven t seen gravity yet what are you waiting for Its one of the best films of the space genre and is sure to be around at the Oscars for best special effects I do recommend 3D for a more immersive experience though,6
20 November 2013,Tense,I now am reassured that I NEVER want to go to space Contains dizzying vertigo tension a lot of suspense and admirable performances Gravity is a powerful movie of two astronauts marooned in space when an accident destroys their shuttle This movie is a technical and visual feast for the eyes Clooney s performance is slightly bland but Sandra Bullock is great in this and gives a knock out performance a solid pick for an Academy Award Gravity lacks a little in dialog there are some corny lines and there are several glaring scientific errors but it s still neat overall entertaining and hard not to enjoy Go see it,8
17 November 2020,Looks nice.,I ve watched two recent lost in space movies this week Both are visually sumptuous but whereas The Martian is convincing and enthralling Gravity is formulaic and frankly a bit daft,6
24 October 2013,Very good movie if you don't go in hyped up,So my husband and I went into the theatre expecting an action packed 3 D adventure and we were excited due to all the hype At the end of the film he was disappointed I was disappointed only because of the hype Had I gone in not knowing anything I would have thought it was a really good movie It is not a fast paced action movie In fact it focuses more on Sandra Bullock s character and the different emotions she goes through as she finds herself in a very frightening position on her first trip to space I think that is where some people get lost If you re looking for the whole move to be what you saw in the trailer you re not going to find it If you like going a little deeper and appreciate symbolism etc and don t mind a slower pace because of it than you will really like this movie SLIGHTLY SPOILER ISH You see Sandra Bullock going through a myriad of emotions from intense panic fear strength hopelessness faith and lack of as well as watching her go from wanting to die to slowly finding her will to live again You go on a journey learning once again how important your psyche is when you find yourselves in situations that are out of your control It s that kind of movie I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it And I know had my husband not gone in with these ultra high expectations ready for a 3D explosion he would have appreciated it a little better,8
4 April 2020,en,This is a human disaster film without the need for colorful special effects and magnificent scenes the silent and dark universe is enough to trigger the audience s deepest loneliness and despair We don t need the roar of the earth and the earth but if we put human beings in the vast universe we will find how helpless and small we are even if we want to return to the land of the foot it is also a challenge and suffering In the coldest and loneliest universe we can calm down and look back at our lives and what we truly value,6
30 September 2017,Amazing visuals and visceral tension throughout,Wow Pretty amazing that the producers and directors got away with a total cast of 2 actors But the photography literally out of this world and the tension created by the filming style and especially Bullock s acting raised this film to a rare level The zero gravity scenes virtually the entire film were very believable I guess much of it was filmed in a centrifuge environment Some of the effects were a little dubious such as times when Bullock Clooney appeared to be holding onto things or each other and streaming out as if air was rushing past them obviously not something that would occur in space but these minor imperfections can be ignored for the greater visual masterpiece of the whole film Certainly a film to be appreciated by all And I only saw it in 2D I guess it would be that much better in 3D,9

3 July 2020,Sooo good,It s brilliant it s soo intense and frightening all I can say it is one of the best films I ve ever watched,10
9 May 2015,Hard to analyze...,While I would not call this movie a masterpiece it was quite great in many aspects If we skipped certain unrealistic aspects of the film related to certain laws of physics or gravity it really catches is you the heart and to the thoughts What if it was you alone in space Something which by the way a very vast area It s hard to believe that I cam to this film only because on YouTube there was debate between Gravity and Interstellar where fans argue that Interstellar was the best I watched both and consecutively and there s no arguments in favor for Interstellar to be greater than Gravity Finally I would not call this a fine analysis because I think that there s really not much to say on the film itself and the scenario is quite simple But I did feel for Sandra Bullock many times in absolute loneliness in such a hostile environment I did also find her screaming and fright quite over the top and non realistic I recommend this film only because in the SciFi space genre Hollywood is in an all time low,5
17 April 2015,"Far from a very important film to me, but I still think it has many things to spare - including what I just said.",Albeit far from being a landmark to me I still highly praise Gravity for its stunning CGI effects stands for computer generated imagery in case a few or some of you did not know about that sure handed direction masterful special effects impressive sound mixing and sound editing unforgettable music magnificent cinematography satisfying running time plot and scientific accuracy which is enough for me to forgive the movie s flaws Gravity has a strong opening and strong ending which I also praise The thing that I found funny about the audience is that on the adult side most people loved or liked this film while on the kid side most or all of them didn t like this film at all When I realized this I was haunted to know how come I wasn t much surprised by this fact though as I already had a little or slight idea of why this fact was as it was but still I wasn t 100 sure why and I wanted to know the answer for sure When thinking of all the things I just said I m like There might be something that kids don t understand from this film which adults understand and yes that s a possible and logical answer to why most adults love or like this film while most kids don t but if this is it then what exactly do kids don t get from this movie and why exactly they don t get it That to me still remains a mystery and I am still curious to know the answer to it How life is mysterious sometimes My original rating for Gravity is 7 0 10 but because of what I said at the very beginning of my review I will raise it to a 7 5 rating,7
9 January 2015,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, with awesome special effects",I had a lot of high hopes for this movie when I watched the trailer and really thought it might be good Boy oh boy I couldn t have been more wrong I cannot believe this movie has received so much credit from the media If you compare this to other movies in the same genre aka 2001 A Space Odyssey the Alien movies close encounters of the third kind OK maybe you say it s not fair to compare it to those movies but even a movie like Moon was better The only good thing about this movie was the visual effects This movie has some of the best special effects I have ever seen in a space film however the rest of the movie is horrific to say the least The biggest mistake they made was putting Sandra Bullock as the main character Someone like Sigourney Weaver Noomi Rapace or even a less popular actor would have played a much better role The acting was bad there was no real or interesting storyline the characters wasn t interesting just nothing Don t believe the hype,1
4 February 2014,A Space Film that's Down to Earth,Gravity opens in space greatest yonder the camera s gaze on earth s big blue sea hovering about in liquid infinity Slowly the astronauts come into view Kowalski is George Clooney s seasoned veteran of the stars and the soothing voice of reason to Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock the medical engineer who s just been contracted to install an important device thing on the Hubble telescope s important device thing so that man can continue to make giant leaps for mankind While spacewalking and telling a story about one of his exes charming Kowalski and Stone get news that due to a Russian vessel s collision with a satellite somewhere else in earth s orbit shards of debris now hurdle toward them at the velocity of a speeding bullet and are circling the earth at the rate of one orbit per this film s running time The mood turns on a dime from leisurely work to utter urgency The action in the coming scenes is flawlessly executed and the filmmakers utilize the actors camera and the synthesized setting to maximum effect At the crux of Alfonso Cuaron s new movie a slim 91 minutes and the most worthwhile time I ve spent in a cinema this year there s a particularly arresting image during a zero G tussle between the astronauts and their attempt to stabilize themselves amidst the speeding debris unmitigated havoc In a heartbreaking exchange between Stone and Kowalski the camera captures a wide shot of the two astronauts and a tangle of slight nylon ribbons barely touched by the sun holding Ryan and Kowalski together It s a beautiful fleeting moment The ribbons and bodies are outstretched for just a moment showing the complete desperation their situation foretells Newton s laws of motion were never made so abundantly clear especially in a story where the burden of gravity is non existent For instance the tethers attaching the astronauts to their vessels are never at rest continually in captivating sinuous motion like sea snakes When we see Stone and Kowalski moving through space seeking refuge in one of their stations or pods we have no idea of their rate of speed until they get closer and need to latch onto something which will keep them from being in perpetual orbit themselves until another object comes along and causes an equal and opposite reaction Aesthetically speaking the zero gravity world of space allows for endless aesthetic choices Since space is a vacuum we hear none of the astronauts exo shuttle actions except their dialog This allows for not only the imagery to take center stage as opposed to films dominated by dialog but it makes what they DO say to be ever more significant like those last few molecules of breathable oxygen in their suits It also renders all of the debris destruction a silent matter begging the presence of music here composed by Steven Price a relatively unknown musician composer until now Price s score is a form of controlled chaos a powerful analog living and breathing structure with steep raw and ominous synthesizer crescendos and manic strings almost a character itself within the larger purpose it serves Visually there are countless opportunities for a filmmaker to use the blackness of space and the fluid movement that zero G allows to cinematic advantage When Stone initially gets flung from her safety line she flies into the depths of dark space in the center of the screen getting smaller and smaller and then when the screen is blackest we then see her careening back towards the camera her peril none the lesser Yet Cuaron to his credit doesn t necessarily need to take advantage of this In other scenes he lets the camera drift about sometimes slowly panning or floating between characters and within their cavernous structures and then sometimes witnessing the chaos of the orbiting debris all seemingly without many cuts at all This greatly aids the story into a very cohesive seamless whole going from whistle while you work to dire fight for survival Cuaron is no stranger to this mellifluous style In his previous feature Children of God he does much the same thing gliding a camera following Clive Owen through 9 minutes worth of bob and weave bullet and bomb traffic Emanuelle Lubeszki is the cinematographer in both films in addition to Malick s Tree of Life and may very well be nominated for his work here this Oscar season Of course none of this technique and style hold much weight without the stellar performances of the leads making it a story worth a damn Clooney is an apt semi optimistic romantic and attractive enough to make Stone wonder about a lost loved one but Bullock becomes the emotional reserve into which Gravity invests it s lasting power She is the emotional element the fourth dimension space cannot occupy There are the expected homages to cinema s forbears numerous shots of floating pens and a womb like Sandra Bullock a la Kubrick s masterpiece 2001 A Space Odyssey Some of the more tragic scenes of falling bodies recall DePalma s underrated Mission to Mars a criminally overlooked contender to the space film canon Ultimately though Gravity holds it s own Cuaron conjures images of floating fire in once scene and a remarkable close up of one of Stone s tears in a later scene Just as he s aware of how tall an order a space movie is he is ecstatic yet tactful about showing the genre s possibilities After all in so many ways filmmaking is about quality control Although some of the music choices near the end suggest happy ending resolve and the end is a bit over the top down to earth Gravity is an astronomical achievement Ultimately it s a movie that is less about everything than past cinematic odysseys so there are no unanswered questions which is perhaps the reason for its digestibility among the common viewership It does pose some important questions about ourselves and our unfathomable universe It will move you and it will make you glad you re on solid ground,9
24 September 2023,Amazing images that take your breath away,The film is produced in 2013 A different movie that doesn t take place on earth at all and all the story takes place in space Amazing images that take your breath away due to the events Maybe the script or the story are not very important in this movie and the visual effects are the first word However the story cannot be overridden and it must be said that the characters are in the worst situations to choose the best decisions and save themselves Everything is calm in this movie Movements sounds are calm in most of the movie But the events come quickly to the characters Life expectancy and whether they will finally put their foot on the ground is one of the most important points of the film There are many details in this film including the Cold War between America and Russia Where the explosion of a Russian spaceship resulted in the launch of fragments suspended in space and harmed the American astronauts Overall the movie is acceptable,5
12 October 2013,In the eye of the beholder,It s funny how a literal change in point of view can beautify the hell out of something Before I get into the meat of the film I have to mention it had an unfair advantage over any other film in history This film exploited the overview effect with the first capable match of technology and affordability also paired with raw talent to show the Earth as if it and it is ALIVE The film attempted to contemplate life and it s echo s and did so in an honorable way However any acclaimed intellectual can see that it is not a contextually deep film It has strong highlights backed by unreal cinematography if we can still use that term to describe CGI but isn t a 100 complete film George Clooney 10 10 may have been the only capable human being on earth to fulfill with elegance such a prototypical role Sandra Bullock 6 10 did not give enough UMPH There is no other way to describe it I just needed MORE I think Natalie Portman Charlize Theron or Hilary Swank should ve been casted I don t feel like explaining my opinions today and I m about to go intoxicate myself beyond any societally acceptable means May we hope beyond yesterday,9
19 October 2013,Great Visuals but a bit too unbelievable for me,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,5
30 October 2013,Watch on 3D only,If you rented downloaded copied this movie you ve wasted your time as this film can ONLY be enjoyed on the big screen with 3D glasses on Thumbs up to the graphics editor that was most likely the best part of the film Other than that the movie lacks a proper plot and it surprised me that such a good actress like Sandra Bullock was given a script that hears her breathing in and out more than talking Her hair was cut short which was a bit of a let down Would have liked to see her long hair swaying in the Zero gravity with added 3D effects Also when you look through the cast all you see next to the names is Voice That brings you to wonder couldn t the producers afford more actors I m not an astronaut myself but it really seemed to me like it was a tad unrealistic but hey aren t all movies I cant hold that one against Gravity as this is Hollywood and people enjoy a good Sci Fi I give it 7 out of 10 for the good effort Good actors And Awesome 3D,7

25 January 2014,True Antigravity Experience!,I saw the prescreening at the Telluride Film Festival in 3D and I must say I literally felt in space catching myself taking short breaths with the actors and filling dizzy trying to grab hold on my armrests a few times This is by far a movie with the most realistic effects I ve ever seen so far Fantastic cast exquisite sci fi plot an interesting twist or I should say very unexpected and I better stop right here before I blurt out some spoilers I really don t wish to spoil your experience because whatever else I say will contain spoilers and that s mainly the reason why I decided to write about my feelings rather than critique the movie itself My only small concern is the music soundtrack which is rather a collection of sound beds and perilous sonic effects not exactly a musical extravaganza like the majestic Star Wart s symphony for example That said this SFX soundtrack fits perfectly the antigravitational cinematic experience so that s perfect However don t try to listen it at home on a CD unless you want to get depressed from the meaningless feelings it conveys amplifying the emptiness of space and its horrific shocking depravity of life Just a mild warning there Godspeed to all watching it in 3D,10
3 March 2014,Weak and frustrating plot and characters!,I got to think this was one very weak and short screen play Lacking much dialog which I understand but also lacking much of a plot Its girl in space who is kind of pitiful as well as lacking in adequate knowledge that bumbles along frustrating you with her slow reflexes It s lack of foresight and knowledge enough to operate equipment even to avoid catastrophe or move faster than a snail VS the big bad outer space Look I hear the triumphant music in the background I hear all that stuff that usually brings me to tears of joy or just an over all a feeling of being moved by the success of the underdog But not this time this time I m crying are you kidding Oh come on she hasn t ever seen bewitched Did she really not know any better than to open her capsule from the side while floating in water The hatch is obviously on the top so please give characters foresight and intelligence otherwise I feel nothing for or toward them other than annoyance That capsule crap was the last straw for me it was just mistake after mistake because she didn t think a single thing through Come on even I know that fire and oxygen rich environments like space stations don t mix and I didn t train to go into space So why float on by the little obvious flames Isn t that stuff you learn at the kindergarten of astronaut training I was able to just pick it up from movies and H S Level Science class The graphics were decent that s it I think the graphics dept pretty much wrote directed and produced this baby cause there isn t much else too it Btw I think Sandra Bullock is a great actress but what did she spend most her time doing here Just flopping around I m not seeing any award winning performances there loll Ill give it a solid 3 out of 10 which it only gets because of its budget,3
11 August 2015,Essentially average,Imagine Sandra Bullock and George Clooney s mediocre acting placed into a film that has almost no storyline at all and is held together with fairly poor dialogue and you will wonder why Gravity was watched by anyone at all never mind enjoyed by audiences and critics alike The answer is simple cinematography It is the amazing camera work that holds this film together For the most part the film only has one character in the form of Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock but dull writing and careless acting means that the audience don t even care about her or anything that happens in the film However the film is truly orgasmic to look at and you don t have to know anything about cinematography or special effects to know that this film does both of those things right Despite the cinematographic porn being displayed on the screen it is difficult to see why this film was so loved because aside from this the film was essentially average,7
17 October 2013,So not worth it !,The movie was not only scientifically inaccurate but also extremely boring I forced myself to sit through the entire movie hoping to get some entertainment value and justification for having spent my time and money on this worthless piece of s Somewhere in the middle I actually lost track of the storyline from one scene to the next especially when Bullock enters the Russian spaceship to her riveting journey back to the Earth Maybe Gravity would ve felt about average rating of 5 in another time and place but having just watched Rush before watching this movie didn t help at all Don t quite get the overall rating 5 for this movie Sandra Bullock was annoying to the point of being obnoxious My hopes and expectations had initially rested on George Clooney who turned out to have only a special appearance in the film My recommendation would be to not waste your time money or both to watch this movie in the theaters Wait for a DVD or something if you re desperate,3
26 October 2013,Good Movie being Carried by Special Effects,Your so dazzled by the special effects in this Movie that your blinded to how unrealistic the story is Millions could of been saved on the cost of the Film with lesser known actors because the Effects are so Dazzling Sandra Bullock For once doesn t rely on her beautiful body and good looks to carry her which is nice to see her act George Clooney over all made you care for the Characters giving the movie a personal Connection with the Audience Over all Very entertaining I Review movies by could I watch it again and No I Wouldn t watch this movie again Unless it was with a friend who hadn t This is a watch once movie that you will enjoy the first,7
9 February 2014,Drama at its best,Now how can a movie drama be better than this They used a setting almost alien to 70 of the earth s population The message was identical parallel to 100 of the earth s population it is called survival of the own self Against all ODDS space or earth They did surely succeed How the conceive of this movie came about will be good to know They Cuar n s must have given numerous interviews about how they have come about this I haven t seen one yet Will really like to know The second phase must have been the casting again successful more than 100 Clooney was made to do this Bullock was born to do this This will be her second Academy Mark my words If not something is wrong Thirdly the overall foreground background combo AMAZING I did felt space walking There were earlier space movie projects like this this one tops em all Technically this is strongest Solid 8,8
2 November 2013,Cinema at its best!,Gravity Alfonso Cuar n s latest film that he directed and co wrote with his son Jonas pits medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney together alone in space after Russian satellite debris destroys their shuttle Alone in space cut off from Earth they find themselves fighting for survival with oxygen running low The film begins with the simple statement that Life in space is impossible a phrase which is forever on the mind of the audience and astronauts Stone and Kowalski Much like Cuar n s previous work Children of Men Y Tu Mam Tambi n Gravity has a bleak aspect interspersed with moments of unbridled hope this creates the framework upon which a true masterpiece has been built Visually Gravity is looks absolutely stunning every frame could be frozen and framed above the mantelpiece The velvety blackness of space smothers all it is absolute a vast void that has rarely looked so beautiful Space is just one of the aspects that the 3D element amplifies as in Avatar and Hugo the addition of 3D certainly adds to the experience The tension steadily rising as each minute passes by the claustrophobia of the space suit and the spinning disorientation as the astronauts and other objects weightlessly float across and towards the screen all enhanced by the worthy use of the much maligned 3D format The performances and chemistry of Bullock and Clooney are the perfect complement to Cuar n s ambitious vision understated yet powerful the transformation of Bullock s character is one of the many seamless layers that create this extraordinary feat in filmmaking Gravity does tackle important issues this is no shallow visually focused blockbuster it explores rich themes that are relatable on an existential level to humanity as a whole Communication or the lack thereof religious subtexts the in significance of man and life itself are all profound questions raised using techniques such as masterful camera work and the poignant composition of shots the white speck of an astronaut floating through the darkness being one of countless spectacular images which deserve analysis over pages not sentences Cuar n asks the characters to let go asks you to let go and embrace the unexpected this is not an easy journey for either party Earth is always in frame throughout reflected in a visor reflecting sunlight through a porthole always taunting Stone and Kowalski can almost reach out and touch it yet they are many miles away Gravity a force in nature binding us to Earth a force in cinema binding us to the seat open mouthed in wonder as Cuar n delivers one of the most remarkable films of the 21st century Space has never looked so good Earth has never looked so beguiling and cinema has rarely been so magnificent It reminds me of why I love films and this is undoubtedly the film of the year no the century,9
10 May 2020,If you didn't see this in the cinema - you missed out!,If you didn t see this in the cinema you missed out on a great experience Jaw dropping special effects and atmosphere Sandra Bullock has the difficult task of carrying about 90 of the film on her own and succeeds,10

18 April 2014,Terrible Movie,This is the worst movie ever Sandra Bullock s acting makes Tom Cruise look like a good actor George Clooney should have stuck to the Nespresso adds This is the worst movie ever Sandra Bullock s acting makes Tom Cruise look like a good actor George Clooney should have stuck to the Nespresso adds This is the worst movie ever Sandra Bullock s acting makes Tom Cruise look like a good actor George Clooney should have stuck to the Nespresso adds This is the worst movie ever Sandra Bullock s acting makes Tom Cruise look like a good actor George Clooney should have stuck to the Nespresso adds This is the worst movie ever Sandra Bullock s acting makes Tom Cruise look like a good actor George Clooney should have stuck to the Nespresso adds,1
16 October 2013,"Breathtaking,fascinating and entertaining yet slightly short from that feeling of unbelievable AWE-ness!!",The 3D and audio effects are just so brilliantly forcible and is so enthralling that these technical elements alone can give you goosebumps The screenplay is just marvelous and brilliantly executed Honestly I didn t expect something of this dimension from the Harry Potter POA Director So far this seems to be his best movie The movie doesn t have this usual build up to the climax that normally other movies follow It goes up and then down and then up again and so on But there were some very common clich s which i hoped wouldn t be there in it but the movie plummets into these new scenarios which had a tenacious grip that i didn t even have time to get frustrated on these truisms Definitely a 8 pointer and one of those theater mandatory movies that is worth every penny spent watching in a theater Trust me you wont be disappointed,9
29 December 2013,Gorgeous Peril at Every Turn,Gravity is a fast paced flight through stunning beauty and danger CONS The movie seems short and there s not much time to really learn about the characters PROS This film is very impressive on three main fronts visual imagery technical detail and seat grabbing action The scenes of Earth from orbit are absolutely breathtaking Space is also beautiful in itself the silence of it the empty reaches between objects it s perfect nothing The brilliant cinematography and cgi mastery really take us there I really am in envy of those who have seen it for real if just some movie footage can capture such beauty And no detail is spared The EV suits the Hubble telescope other satellite components the space shuttle space stations and re entry vehicles All are rendered with care and loving attention If you watched this movie 100 times you probably still wouldn t notice all the tiny parts and pieces Space flight does not happen by magic and the film makers really want us to see how much ingenuity and craft has gone into letting us float above our world When some of these parts and pieces get away from us though that s when things get dangerous And there s no deadlier place for this than the airless frozen void of space I won t spoil anything but I will say that I ve never seen destruction that felt so close and immediately threatening I was on the edge of my seat grabbing at anything I could for fear of the character s losing grip and tumbling off into the forever or worse So suit up and grab on this is one hell of a ride,7
1 November 2013,A Hollywood movie for Hollywood,A GREAT movie in terms of special effects and technical challenges they had to overcome Some astronauts have criticised the movie for arcane details they messed up Who cares You feel like its genuine space the whole time However for me the movie seemed to be more about Hollywood showing Hollywood how clever it is with amazing special effects symbolic use of Sandra s breath and huge technical demands on the actors It is easy to get distracted by this but Long 3 4 head shots and dialogue interspersed with frantic action and an extremely predictable plot based on challenge after challenge after challenge did not excite me at all,5
30 January 2014,LAME... Sooooo Lame,This was absolute rubbish Great special effects but that is all The script was terrible it was so clich what little there was There was some degree of suspense occasionally which helped keep the movie alive Even down to the stupid embryo scene when she enters the capsule and floats into the embryo position with the pipes hanging down in the background to simulate the umbilical cord Quite a number of obvious non space conditions which spoiled the spacey environment As I said LAME,2
28 July 2014,Trash,One of the worst I have ever watched and I like Sandra George This movie is almost as bad as Batman Men in Black Ironman which were total crap What happened to meaningful plots and believability I cannot even think of one good thing to say about this Academy nominated junk in fact this movie makes me wonder what is the Acadamey thinking Nothing was believable and as hard as Sandra tried the whole concept failed from beginning to end total ridiculous fantasy with no redeeming qualities Who is paying whom to proport this is as a quality movie This movie is on par with the hostel series except hostel was more believable Makes one wonder about the core values in America those seeking profit at all cost taint the behaviour of the US government the media and those with money only care about the pursuit of what happened to the concepts of integrity and truthfulness I suspect these do not make money,4
2 March 2014,A movie about visuals effects.,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,3

9 December 2013,Great Movie but Good God Sandra Bullock is Annoying,A fantastic movie riveting from start to finish this film has a great story is intensely realistic and the acting is hard to put one s finger on George Clooney kills it as usual playing the confident charismatic alpha male role and fills his role well Sandra Bullock on the other hand grated on my nerves throughout though I m unsure if I should blame her or blame the writer for the portrayal of the surviving female astronaut as a clueless whining and petulant child The absolute inability of her character to deal with reality as it arrives wave after wave is hard to watch at points That being said this is a family friendly film that is terrifying solely through the realistic portrayal of the harrowing situations a modern astronaut could still reasonably face while in orbit,7
13 October 2013,A very good movie,When I first saw the trailer I decided that I ll definitely watch this movie My movie choices are always good except for the man of steel P It was such an awesome movie For all the time I felt that I was in space with all other characters of the movie The storyline is great and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time The effects are amazing It was the best I saw since The Avangers The scene where the ISS was destroyed was one of the best The heartbeat sound in the background matches most of the times with your heartbeats during the movie Sandra bullock s performance is amazing There were some moments in the movie where your eyes gets wet too So don t miss the movie You ll love it,9

4 December 2013,Space flick,This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space Incredibly effective long takes throughout the film bring the realism and suspense that none other space film has ever done before The acting is subtle and engaging Sandra Bullock deserves another Oscar after this as well as best director for Alfonso Cuaron and Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki I can t recommend this film enough Ground breaking beautiful and technically perfect Film schools will be studying this film in the future Really enjoyed it although no fan of Clooney,8
6 October 2013,It's a shame the words 'epic' and 'awesome' no longer mean anything,This isn t a SF movie but hard SF fans will be in raptures It s more of an alternate history but whatever Who cares What matters is the fact that when you go and see this on the big screen in 3D you will be absolutely transported and mesmerised and on the edge of your seat for something like 88 of its 90 minutes I m sure it d be quite compelling on the small screen too but if you don t catch this while it s screening you ll be missing out big time I was initially going to rate it 9 10 merely because a 10 10 is less credible and there s a chance I failed to notice something that d bring it down but no I can t do it It has to get a 10 10 because I can t imagine it being one iota better This film is as good as Moon 2009 Perfect,10

7 November 2013,You don't want to miss this out while its on theater !!!,I don t do this write reviews that often But after watching Gravity I felt that I had to contribute I am a movie buff but good movies are hard to come by these days leave alone the great ones This one is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen The movie captures you right from the first frame till you get home and still can t seem to get it out of your mind I am a hard critic trust me Director hasn t left any space unused in the vast emptiness of the Space Finally I have decided to take Sandra Bullock seriously I can easily see Gravity indicted into the Best Flicks of All Times category,10
5 October 2013,Gravity is a beautiful masterpiece,Gravity is a stunning portrayal of reality created through computer generated imagery blended with live action Are there technical flaws in the crafting of this magnificent creation Perhaps If there were I was unaware of them as I am not an expert on space travel And if there were they can easily be forgiven as there are no flaws in the presentation of the story As the events in this film unfold there is a sense of intense urgency that grabs hold of the viewer and doesn t let go until the final scenes The fragility of the film s main character is its cause One can make a parallel between the character s utter vulnerability and that of our planet which has an almost constant presence on the screen While the film s heroine faces the challenge of being adrift in space with a finite supply of oxygen the earth has a fragile and finite atmosphere that is vital to human existence Just as she struggles to ensure her continued supply of oxygen we struggle to maintain an atmosphere on earth capable of sustaining life In her quest the heroine encounters one setback after another While we face the challenge of ever growing levels of toxicity in our atmosphere with one setback after another to the effort of countering its growth The film s auteur Alfonso Cuar n may have merely been creating an action thriller I would like to think his motive went much deeper No matter his motives Gravity is a masterpiece on many levels and should not be missed,9
11 February 2014,"Rating proves Humans are idiots, It wasn't like gravity, I need lot of pushes .*Overrated*",I saw this movie on IMDb really Hyped with 96 100 metascore 10 Academy nominations which is incredibly awesome there is tag of Sci fi which draw my attention and i watched this movie i thought the movie had some serious story or issues but i couldn t find anything interesting except the awesome Visuals in the movie clooney s appearance was quite good but it didn t even make the sense Well i don t know what is wrong with the people they go mad seeing such CGI and stuff Same as they did with MAN OF STEEL and THOR DARK WORLD which are stupid movies with Awesome CGI Well i am not recommending you to see this movie unless you just want to time pass this is good for one time watch i better recommend you to play CALL OF DUTY GHOST who have some space missions which are cool well i appreciate the effort of bullock and clooney but it can t save the day Though CGI did Drama 3 10 Dialogues 3 10 Acting 5 10 Visual Effects 9 10 Story 1 10 Total 4 2 10 Overall 5 10 from me,3
30 November 2013,What is happening to movies...?,When I saw Gravity ranking in the 250 right between Taxi driver and the great dictator I thought my eyesight has gone bad Are there any ambitious critics left out there If you like a movie or not depends sometimes on personal taste or expectations but seriously this is not a good movie not ONE BIT It s but a theme park ride I have to admit it seeing Gravity on the big screen is an experience like no other The 3d isn t even that good but the so called camera work really makes you feel like floating in space The visual effects are stunning the whole look suits great The sound effects are arranged like a first person experience it s awesome Summarized these features give the viewer an effect of the physical experience which the protagonist is going through But that s it The movie is more of a demonstration of what modern cgi is capable to achieve The whole rest of what makes a movie great like an original story good acting well written characters or even authenticity Gravity screws it up All of it The background story of Sandra Bullocks character is the most clich d and cheesy thing i ve seen in a while her acting is so unsubtle that it almost hurts The dog scene is the most embarrassing thing it s not even funny The dialogue is insulting everyones intelligence who has a little bit of sense of criticism left Many of these issues are to blame on the script of course The ending is decent at least George Clooneys character isn t even worth mentioning I don t want to imagine what a great movie it could have been if they used a good script and a suitable actress Like this Gravity is evidence of the incapacity of professional critics and it shows how much the overall voting culture on IMDb lost its proportionality I am worried about the influence this movie will have on future works 5 out of 10 because it s a cool experience once but it will be buried in oblivion right after sighting it The perfect movie for modern throwaway society,4
7 January 2014,"A cinematic masterpiece. A sci-fi,and not only, myth has been delivered.",hose who are really fans of sci fi will probably understand most why I make this comment GRAVITY is for the 21st century what ALIEN was for the 20th Watch it from beginning opening title to end and you will see subtle mythwise similarities What made ALIEN a sci fi and cinematic myth it is all there with no exception and even more so it may very well be viewed as a dramatized documentary for early human exploration of space our first steps in the vast vastness of space the challenges the dangers the fears the mishaps our ignorance our lack of knowledge our limited resources and so on and so on and yet we were bold and curious enough to pursuit whatever was is and would be GRAVITY is a homage to everything that makes human beings good and decent and grand and wonderful and strong and so incredibly fragile and petite It is not Science Fiction any more think about it we just caught a glimpse of what how it is up there out there NOW and not 50 80 163 years from now in a galaxy far far away When I first saw the trailer it captured my imagination and since then I was looking forward to watching it Well I did amazed thrilled and taken I was beyond any expectation It is and it is not a sci fi film at the same time It will be nominated for quite a few Oscars no doubt It must win them all EVERY ONE OF THEM It is completely in a league of its own They must make another Oscar category for films like GRAVITY Future in our time masterpiece,

18 February 2019,I think it's overrated,I really didn t like this movie THAT much It s good but as 7 0 10 not much more,6
30 March 2023,Decent film. Smart soundtrack makes it work.,Proof that a soundtrack can truly carry a film The final ten minutes felt so satisfying alongside Shenzou by Steven Price I felt like my time investment was worthwhile by the end of it felt a tad longer then it needed to be however I think the pace used merits it putting aside the absurdity of the ending which was a bit too abrupt and seemed rather outlandish even for a sci fi Regardless Sandra Bullok and George Clooney provide decent enough performances and the story was unique enough to make it an all around solid movie Definitely worth the watch for those looking for something new,7
27 January 2014,Have you ever had that dream...,Have you ever had that dream you know the one where you are detached from your physical body and you are floating around your room Well this film manages to give you that very same feeling or at least very close Its an experience a roller coaster ride a chance for you to gaze at the stars far from the city and an opportunity to see the world from outer space for what it is Earth is a marble A beautiful marble A marble neutralized of aqua green turquoise blue snow flake white and a God given glossy touch to its colors Seeing it in the big screen and in 3D is a gift It is for thy reason why Gravity has been recognized and appreciated by so many It deserves all the awards a movie in the making of five years would take Very few movies have people returning to see a movie I remember I went to see it a few days before it was supposedly going to be its last show yet the room was still 3 4 full People were actually seeing it again bringing in their colleges I belief it s because the movie is sort of like a roller coaster After you are done with the ride you want to act as a child and get back in line for another one The music is very engaging the heart beat tones and the several sounds of transmitted vibrations all get to you I didn t want to see the movie because people raved about it I wanted to see it because I saw a short clip at the Imax website I actually believed that it was a production from Imax When the movie was over and I found out otherwise I wasn t disappointed but surprised All the cinematography that is expected from an Imax documentary was present To me this movie is a first of its kind and definitely a closer take to a 4D film,10

13 January 2014,'Gravity' pulls its weight well,Despite a mere 91 minute running time director Alfonso Cauron makes every minute count with a gripping story of survival against impossible odds The visuals in this film are so beautiful it s almost as if it should be part of the National Air Space Museum s archival footage The action sequences are heart pounding and relentless Sandra Bullock pulls out all the stops with her picture perfect performance If you ve seen this movie you could probably imagine Ryan Stone being you in that situation I walked away from this movie wondering what might happen if I were forced to confront such a predicament This small yet masterfully made film has it all Emotion action suspense comedy drama horror you name it Maybe not as broad of a scope in its plot as we ve come to expect in recent years but most certainly a movie that is a true testament to the human spirit With the Oscar nominations just around the corner here are my choices to nominate this film for BEST PICTURE BEST ACTRESS BEST DIRECTOR potential front runner BEST FILM EDITING BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY potential front runner BEST ORIGINAL SCORE BEST SOUND EDITING potential front runner BEST SOUND MIXING BEST VISUAL EFFECTS potential front runner,8
9 March 2014,It's good.,When I first saw the trailers to this i said oh this is gonna fail but then I heard it was amazing then i said damn can t believe I missed it in theaters I finally saw it on demand and it was good Just not as good as i was expecting It did deserve some awards which it did but i think it won too many awards The story wasn t really there there was a good story but I feel it s one of those sad moments when the visual effects throw story out the window one thing i do have to say have a good sound system and a huge TV then you will get the full Gravity experience it was good check it out it isn t the best but it s good,7
13 October 2013,"recommend, but not wowable",The overall quality is good special effects are wowable and the storyline is intense However it lacks drama which makes it little bit boring during watching Sandra is such a great performer who uplifts this movie due to her stunning acting In addition the movie is too short which is only about 90 minutes we went to the cinema 15 minutes late and felt that the movie ended so quickly The effects of D box were so cool that I really enjoyed it It s absolutely worth every dollar I spent on it I highly recommend you guy to try the d box seat To be honest the story is interesting but it lacks drama as that I know exactly what s gonna happen at last minute she will land in the sea bingo Bottom line it is a better than average movie,8
19 July 2019,Sandra made this movie great,I am not a fan of Sci Fi but this one movie is surprisingly awesome for me Sandra Bullock and George Clooney gave this movie a nice touch as I just cannot imagine other actors in their places Seeing Bullock in such a movie was new to me as she is always in comedies However she played her role very good and I guess that is how true professionals show their talent by playing a role outside of their comfort zones About Clooney I can say that despite his role being so short he was also an important part of the movie as he and Bullock were so lovely with each other and that made the movie more likable A movie worth watching,7

24 December 2013,Without words,Amazing great I don t know what else to say it left me without words Initially I didn t trust the critics and thought this was just another Howllywood overrated crap However I decided to give it a try and oh my god The acting was superb the effects are mind blowing and the story and pace are great with quite a good script This film demonstrates you don t need a stupid monster to feel fear Nature and space are more than enough to scare the hell out of us when humans have to face the emptiness far away from any help My hat off for this movie the actors director and staff,10

28 October 2023,no no no no no no no,I love Sci fi films and this looks like it could have been as epic as the film 2001 The effects are brilliant you can beleive the film is for real but the story line goes down hill almost from the start It starts with oxygen levels four percent and loud bleeping and buzzes filling the soundtrack Then something haopens and Sandra Bullock goes no no no no no no no and then a lot of wide angles and bodies whizzing about and then they just make it Phew Then ten minutes the whols scene is repeated and its back to no no no no no no no until the crisis is averted And then it repeats yet again and again Not recommended,4
8 January 2014,Missing Gravitas,This film was not what I expected I was actually pleasantly surprised That doesn t however mean it was the brilliant film most have been raving about The cinematography cgi work was breathtaking and stood out for most of the film There was action Really And a lot of it I caught myself on a few occasions glued to the screen apprehension drawn all over my face Sadly my face appeared to have more emotion that that of Sandra Bullock s Dr Ryan Both she and Clooney playing the somewhat garrulous astronaut Kowalski appeared to be going through the motions giving underwhelming performances As the film progressed the situations Dr Ryan found herself in became increasingly more ridiculous It all begins with the Russians bombing their own satellite by accident already facepalm creating debris and initiating a chain reaction of events And yes the physics of it all was not as accurate as some might want you to believe Clich s galore let s also chuck in a side story about the protagonist s massive personal loss from her recent past to make her more approachable Likable Believable Oh wait to add the existential dilemma needed for added emotional gravitas to the film Right Yet one would be able to suspend their belief if the dialogue supported it In this film it didn t It was frankly quite juvenile at times This could of been for me the masterpiece others saw had more effort been put in parts of the plot and most of the dialogue the later being what I m holding responsible for both Bullock and Clooney s subpar performances In summary NOT the innovative masterpiece expected however a watchable pop corn movie nonetheless,6

30 August 2020,Pretty much satisfactory overall,Well the story wasn t that great but it in fact seems closer to reality The set was amazing and the visuals are actually stunning Just some flaws I noticed while watching the film I won t point it out I d like you to watch it especially if you re an astronomical freak My only complaint is the space doesn t feel like the space at points It becomes so clear that it s shot in an anti gravity room at times Well ignore that if you really want to enjoy the movie Sandra Bullock was nice throughout and George Clooney as well There s nothing much to talk about performances,7
15 July 2014,Wow,This movie is downright amazing the cinematography is amazing Definitely a movie I thought about for a few weeks after watching it and I still find myself asking myself how did they do that The cinematography was unlike anything I have ever seen The shots were so good its almost as if you thought you were there The visual effects were amazing it literally looks like the movie was shot in space The art direction was at top caliber The sound was just insane If you have an option to watch this movie in surround sound PLEASE DO Its movies like these that make me glad I chose film as my passion and career path I hope that one day I can shoot something half as good as this I was throughly inspired to a whole new degree and I doubt that you are going to get any bad reviews visually on this movie I am writing this review as a cinematographer but the semi writer in me did find a few holes here and there which didn t make too much sense but hey all around I give this movie a 10 10,10
2 February 2014,Intense,So I started watching this movie not really sure what to expect because I m not much of a Sci Fi fan I watched it on the basis that there have been so many good reviews I have not regretted my decision It is impossible to put into words how this movie actually makes you feel It is superb It is intense When you consider that there are only 2 actors really in this film and it whittles down essentially to 1 it is mesmerizing that it could be so intense I am literally unable to move effectively I have to give myself some time This movie took me on a journey I didn t know whether Ryan would die or survive You empathize with her but then it s almost beyond that you experience everything she s experiencing without actually experiencing it The visual effects are awesome and astounding and they take you out of your comfort and bring you along with them The sound mimics your own internal processes with that wicked heart beat effect Just brilliant Brilliant,10

3 March 2014,What film did everyone else watch,When this first came out in the cinemas there was a lot of hype around it and it got really good reviews So being a fan of space films i couldn t wait to see it After watching it i thought it was completely overrated Don t get me wrong though some of the scenes were visually spectacular and were great However i don t understand how this won so many awards let alone an 8 2 on IMDb So in summary had great visual effects but didn t live up to the hype or reviews Basically had Sandra bullock breathing heavily for 91 minutes Was it worth the watch Kinda after all the hype and awards i say no However if you wanna see an average movie with good visual effects then yes,6

26 April 2014,"Visually Spectacular, story was weak and predictable",This movie was so moving and stimulating it kept me for hours Koodos to the production staff music sound editing special effects for this project They were the real heroes to this They made a film that really moved people and captivated the audience from start to finish I can appreciate the research that the film did to make it authentic and real The script was the weakest part of the project I know this is a way to get an audience but next time it use something less predictable However minus the script this movie was a success I did feel like George Clooney s presence was a waste How many times do we have to see him I would say the same about Bullock but she was believable,8

23 January 2023,Immortality of space heroes,The vast and boundless universe is the goal that human beings have been exploring and pursuing To this day human beings have not stopped exploring the universe This film is about the story between two astronauts exploring the universe This is the first film I saw about space It can be said that after this film it has also brought into the trend of a relatively hot space film After that many space films have come out First of all the 3D technology of this film is not far from that of previous films but its experience of 3D images is stronger than that of other films Moreover the background of this film is the vast universe and the effect of 3D presentation is certainly stronger than that of other films Although there was no full scene sound at that time the sense of orientation of the sound position is still very clear In addition we have the behavioral perception of motion which can be said to be very realistic In the expression of the specific plot although the plot is relatively simple it is also very concise and does not affect the emotional generation When the female star is in a desperate situation due to the lack of battery power suddenly a voice in the dream let him find a solution and finally successfully returned to the earth through the Chinese spaceship Although the Chinese space shuttle space station had not been fully established at that time the director had provided us with a very ideal Chinese space station At that time the Chinese audience was still very excited Finally I would like to say that no matter which country they come from these astronauts are very brave,7
1 January 2021,"Loved it from start to finish, couldn't take my eyes off the screen",It s amazing how Cuar n together with the whole team exceeds to create this masterpiece of a film With so few actors eyes are on you all the time Both Sandra and George do an amazing job at letting me believe they re actually in space Good job One delves into feelings of despair longing sadness excitement One of a ride This is one of those films I just know I ll be watching over and over And that s not part of my usual film routine Thank you to all involved,8

22 September 2017,Gravity Is Highly Underrated!,Reviews that incredulously rip apart this film are wasted on me I never went into the theater thinking that this is accurate I however marvel at how brilliant this movie is The chemistry between characters and their individual relationship with outer space leaves the viewer the ability to hypothesize the events leading to Dr Stone walking away in the sand I personally think each time I see this movie my interpretation is different Lastly let me gush over Sandra Bullock s transformation into Dr Ryan Stone She slayed this role and reminded us that she is simply one of the best actresses ever She and George Clooney take this film to another level If you are reading this and have not yet seen this film please do so now after you crawl out from underneath that rock you have been living under You re welcome,10

14 July 2014,This won awards?,I thought for sure the movie was going to be good considering the actors within The fact that it won awards over other movies made me think there is no way this isn t going to be a good movie I was wrong It takes More then just a few fancy CGI scenes and some explosions make a movie So where do I begin The technical part of this movie is lacking Its starts off with a scene of astronauts just carelessly floating around outside the ship along with two just having a nice little conversation in space with no apparent reason to believe they are aware of their surroundings Warned of impending trouble and they seem to just take their time One goes floating out into space and the spinning made me feel like I was ill Disregard the fact that if that had happened the game is over for that crew member No way another would risk loosing himself to go after that person in all that turmoil Then comes macho Clooney They have been up there all that time and they know nothing about each other OK yeah sure He is in peril just as much as she is and they just nicely have a conversation while floating back to more trouble Character development is not there We have no emotional state in their survival Beyond the clich s and unreal options the movie falls flat We got one picking buttons via eenie meenie minnie mo and another who just gives up without a fight after risking it all to rescue someone I cant tell you anymore suffice to say the films ending isn t much better then what you already see leading up to it You just are left with a That was it feeling and a wow I wasted that hour of my life I give 4 stars only cause of the two actors trying to make it work Otherwise the film is a flop Gotta do better Hollywood if you are going to keep our attention,4
24 January 2014,Pathetic,I guess I m outvoted But I ll speak my mind anyway The non stop flirtatious banter between Clooney and Bullock is completely out of place in a movie where two people are supposed to be fighting for their lives throughout most of the movie I had no sense of suspense Bullock making sure that she gets to be alluring talks to herself quite a bit in an unrealistic cutesy Anything to add to her stardom The music stunk The best thing about this movie was Bullocks legs which are featured prominently in all their glory The only person connected with this turkey who should get an Oscar is her personal fitness trainer for the legs,2

9 March 2014,"""Well done"" and boring. Both true. Both subjective.",The movie is beyond any doubt well done Well acted beautiful images script and direction are OK And in ANY movie it is always a matter of tastes So no review can ever be really objective So if you like introspective movies where the action stays in little things where nothing particular happens where the acting is everything and where there is not lot of social interaction and if you liked Solaris Europa Report and Moon then you will enjoy this film If you are more like me more for movies where there are many things happening more than Sandra Bullok s worried face and oh no we are lost for 90 minutes then you may find this movie very well acted and quite boring,6

23 March 2021,Nothing further than the Visual Effects,Gravity is a movie that has truly stunning visual effects and heavily relies on them to carry the movie This can work with a good script but unfortunately this script is anything but spectacular The performances and direction is great but the story and plot is so basic and uninspiring that I can give this movie no more than a 7,7
25 October 2013,Watch for the visual effects only,Frankly watching the trailer and reviews from my friends I went in with a lot of expectations In the end it was somewhat a disappointing experience I cannot imagine how can people tout this as the next big thing after 2001 A space odessey Barring the visuals there isn t anything in the movie reality is far fetched story is weak intensity breaks up in between Acting is well expected to be good with Sandra and Clooney At some moments in the movie I expected a philosophical angle or an inspirational side to it But even that was found wanting The end was especially disappointing Seemed like they didn t had a proper script to bring her back to Earth and just went with a 2nd grader method of solving problems Watch but lower your expectations,6
24 June 2014,Weak movie to say the least,The advertisement of this movie was quite promising This movie lacks logic and reality I know that this is a science fiction film but the main plot is absolutely ridiculous At first i thought that only the first five minutes of this movie is a complete fail but the rest is not any better The movie is boring to say the least The development of the main character is weak and rough I have to admit that the special effects and the view space and Earth is really amazing but this is IT The movie is not worth to see again I think it will fade away in the whole cinematography and no one will remember it until someone make another one complete remake Movie is nothing special really I advise to see something better and keep this as a worst pick from the movie list Still cannot understand why this is rated above 6,4

28 November 2022,Best in class for a Sci fi movie,One the best sci fi movie I have ever watched the acting or the performance of the cast in this movie was so incredible and the soundtrack used in the background was amazing I loved it and finally the CGI or computer graphics or whatever you call it was so realistic I think this is the only movie for which I gave 10 10 because how incredible this movie was So this is why it make sense that this movie has won 7 Oscars as it totally deserves it The earth from the space in the movie looked so astonishing that I can easily watch that part over and over again and I would still not get bored so yaa it totally makes sense to give this movie the highest rating that is possible atleast on behalf of me,10
3 January 2018,A New Chapter to the Sci-Fi Drama,Gravity accomplished something that many realistic space movies usually lack and that s visual entertainment which is what this movie is visual entertainment yes this story is criticized for its weak story but as I said it s a new chapter because with today s technology the visual effects are outstanding and with the right director and story there will be a perfect realistic Sci Fi movie,7
6 September 2020,Gravity is Okay !,Yeah its a good movie shows the nature of space The Survival The story is not so perfect but if you love space you can go for it It will be able to bind you for 1 5 hour surely,6
29 January 2014,Looks great,Let me just say that this picture has restored my faith in film making Now it s not in theaters and is not brand new But it s a fantastic film I got to see this film back in October It was a well shot film the acting was great One of the great things about the film is that yeah the location and story line worked but I could almost see it working anywhere else like under water too I enjoyed it very much I look forward to what this team does in the future I think when you put a high caliber production company like them and the acting talent that that have it would only result in a fine end product I think it s a film that needs to be seen on the big screen Waiting to see it home will only rob you of the full experience So if you find it in a retro theater house I highly recommend that you see it,8
24 February 2014,Over-hyped nonsense. (spoilers),These reviews seem to all agree on one thing the visuals were great Yes Earth is very beautiful from space we can stare at it all day I m sure But that s about it for the visuals Earth every once in awhile beautifies the movie over and over Other than that the visuals were above average but nothing to gawk at and be mesmerized by Sandra Bullock who plays a character that I guess some may be interested in but I found to be weak and lucky Not worthy of astronaut status George Clooney plays a robot who enjoys country music Clich d hero indeed No sense of urgency at all and is very weird I guess there may be a few psychopaths who may react like that if they were ever up in space and have been found to be imminently doomed but I doubt they would make it to be an astronaut and would likely be trying to commit some mass genocide instead Both characters basically suck About 30 mins into the movie I pretty much give up on it and all hope for the remaining whatever minutes Running at about 2 left of oxygen and they need to get to a luckily nearby unmanned space station instead of saving their breathe they both proceed to have a half hour long conversation about nothing About how beautiful the earth is Or the sunrise is from space As if the movie was made and those lines were made only to reinforce you graphic enthusiasts and would be able to call this the greatest space movie of all time somehow The story is pretty ridiculous overall I am all in favor of suspending understanding of reality in favor of entertainment but from what I heard about this movie I was looking for a realistic depiction of space travel maybe like Apollo 13 which essentially blows this movie away While I understand that may be my fault for expecting this it still doesn t change the fact this movie was pretty stupid for the most part Sorry I paid 20 for the VUDU download,4

12 November 2013,"Execution OK, but no story",First there seems nothing wrong with this movie Not the visuals not the acting There might be a few inconsistencies that bother the hard core physicist but that does not matter In fact there is no single detail there I would really object to emphatically But there is one thing seriously missing a story The heroine falls from one hole into the next until the very end That s it It s a roller coaster ride not more and while that s entertaining at times it is very very empty It should be played on a Disneyland ride or used in cut scenes for a video game but it does not hold as a movie Being void of dialogue and relationships makes this movie very boring and meaningless It is hard to empathise with the main character at all And this is no fault of Sandra Bullock but of the screen writing or the lack of it,4

15 October 2013,"Suffocating and breath taking, a one of a kind space drama",Earth A home for all of us a doom for some few Engineer Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is doing some set ups on a Nasa satellite orbiting the Earth in company of astronaut Kowalski George Clooney and some Indian guy Sandra is feeling sick of being in space if only the poor girl knew about what s coming next After a few minutes of jokes and awkward space walking the Astronauts are warned by Mission control Houston as usual that Russians have fired a missile into space to destroy one of their satellites causing multiple debris to fly at high speed into their direction the debris destroyed other satellites on their way causing a snowball effect that will eventually destroy all satellites and space stations around the Earth including the ISS if there were no Russians life would be boring And so it begins The Indian guy is taken out immediately and spectacularly it was a second character anyway no biggie Sandra uncontrollably spins out of orbit and drifts into deep space only George stays in control of course The rest of the movie is a story about survival in impossible space vacuum conditions a fight against emptiness a fight against our own self From the very first moment you dive directly into the suffocation panic despair and uncontrollable fear displayed by the characters very well mixed with quite impressive sound and visual effects The movie although not without some unrealistic scenes feels highly real on your skin is very well paced and takes your breath away quite a few times The show will tear you apart between magnificent views of our planet and the blood freezing context of life in space After this it s good to feel alive and on Earth Definitely worth watching,8

21 October 2013,Tense. Masterful. Stunning.,The movie begins with a man made craft floating in space a speck in a vast universe that is yet to be conquered by mankind This opening shot is around 17 minutes in length and within 02 minutes in to this shot several people in the theater gasped wow So did I This is the most spectacular opening shot I ve ever seen in a motion picture and the movie is a visual triumph by all means If you were a fan of the single shot sequences in Alfonso Cuar n s previous movie Children of Men then this one will blow your mind There has been lot of hype about this movie and Gravity delivers I am predicting 03 Academy Award nominations for this already Best Picture Best Director and Best Visual Effects with the latter having a high chance of winning Unlike any other recent science fiction space movies Gravity isn t a movie about a parallel universe with advanced technology or concepts It s a survival story set in space with one tense moment after another Alfonso Cuar n s Gravity stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney two A list heavy weights perhaps suggested by WB studio in case the film needed the star power push considering the bold concept of the film It works but the true star in Gravity is neither a person nor a living being but a technical achievement it s visuals that take you along for a breathless ride The argument of whether 3D cinema must exist or not continues but all it takes for a movie like Gravity to reminds us that 3D can be spectacular when used by filmmakers with a clear vision In honesty watching this in a normal screen would be similar to owning a sports car yet only using it in its first gear Gravity is tense moving and even terrifying Combine that with amazing shots of space this easily becomes my favorite movie in 2013,10
23 January 2014,"Aw, really ?",Had such high hopes for this movie after reading so many IMDb reviews praising its visuals and story line Ended up as another movie that completely summed up its value in its trailer First 15 minutes had us totally but like the fate of the crew the remaining story just crashed and burned leaving us wondering why this movie had such a high rating Honestly speechless at the user ranking of the movie of 2013 My wife and I honestly tried to forgive and hang on to this experience after looking forward to its release Such a shame that two talented and acclaimed actors gave in to such a technically flawed and emotionally desperate script Apollo 13 Europa and even Dark Star had this movie in spades,3
30 January 2014,Not impressed,I ve watched it and I ll never watch it again Perhaps if I watched it in 3D I d be impressed like most people but I find this movie shallow two dimensional even a little trashy Believe if it weren t for A listers and big budget and special effects this movie would be just a blip Acting is actually great but story dialogue message of the whole movie is really weak Also there are a lot of unconvincible trashy things that I d rate this movie watchable and 7 only if real astronaut explained it to me as believable Strictly subjective everything but acting was weak story is shallow and quite stupid survival getting over lost It s just a big fancy shiny wrap with two great actors doing their best and bow on it Nothing more to it,6

15 December 2019,"Good, special effect driven, but good still.",I m pretty bored to death of special effects My idea of a good spectacle is creating believable characters I mean come on HOW do they do it That being said I give credit when it s due this film is driven by special effects but it does something wonderful along the way it manages to be entertaining The characters aren t so deep and neither is the plot but man it s just a ride from start to finish and who can complain about that,8

7 February 2014,awesome cinematography and not much more...,first the good the opening sequence is absolutely masterful and pulls you right into the world of the movie several big set pieces later on also look and sound great the very creative and effective sounddesign are also noteworthy now the rest was i watching the same movie as everyone else because the version i watched had no emotional depth whatsoever contained several ludicrous plot devices used audience manipulation 101 techniques and featured a few emotional character scenes that were so badly acted it made me cringe after the opening i really really wanted to like this movie but piece by piece it wore me down until in the end i was even a bit mad at it for looking so great but being so emotionally hollow and so sloppy with common sense the scene where clooney untethers himself reminded me of a similar stupid pointless gesture from a movie i had hoped i had forgotten vertical limit the long wait for a return of good science fiction movies continues rating 6 10 slightly above mediocre,
14 October 2013,Stunning visuals but not very realistic,I guess all the hype about this movie had raised my expectations which is never a good thing Nevertheless I wanted to see the movie in IMAX 3D to get the full effects which I did First off George Clooney sounded more like Danny Ocean than like a real astronaut This is not to say that astronauts don t make jokes and tell stories but under the circumstances of the movie that folksiness was misplaced But my main problem with this movie is that it was filled with disasters that would have killed the astronauts several times over but somehow they are survivable in this movie In truth that makes it similar to many Hollywood films like Mission Impossible for example But we expect that kind of unbelievability in movies like that whereas we were led to believe that this one was more realistic and that s why I ultimately felt let down Most of the situations faced in this movie simply were unbelievable I also have to say that the ending came way too suddenly as if the real ending had been cut off Did the filmmakers not know how to end the movie It sure seemed that way Ultimately I am glad I saw it but felt a little ripped off after having paid 16 for an IMAX ticket I expected more,5
2 March 2014,Not Oscar Worthy!,Although the eye candy is delicious this movie is more far fetched than a James Bond flick Just because it has a star line up doesn t mean the film has content that qualifies for the Academy Awards Many people criticize the Oscars and this is a first for me to say that this nomination was a mistake Don t get me wrong Gravity was entertaining and kudos to the CGI people but that s where it ends The film s big problem is leading the viewer to believe that this could happen based on facts and science The acting was adequate and the director was able to transfer emotion and circumstance to the viewer fairly well Instead of miraculous survival the film should have focused on how one faces certain death,6
6 January 2014,Over-exaggerated drama in the movie,I know everyone thinks I m nuts for saying this but I have a different opinion about this movie I believe the whole action being exaggerated and lacking every bit of realism or let me say it lacks good sense This so called wow of the movie is nothing else but an exaggerated drama you know when this or that happens can t say more sorry I don t want this to be a spoiler comment Realistically speaking I would call this movie medium poor rather then a great movie No idea tho why people tend to get so highly emotive on over exaggerated unrealistic drama but my only hope is people did not give this movie a Great movie vote just because Sandra Bullock and George Cloney are playing in it Other then the two playing in the movie most of it is made out of simple scenes linear story some special effects made on computer not very good ones etc Sorry is just my opinion and I respect everyone else s opinion but I can t give this movie a higher note then medium poor,4
10 October 2013,An amazing experience that was somewhat ruined...,This film is definitely one of the most stunning films ever to reach the silver screen Both the technicality and simplicity of the shots allows the viewer to fall straight into the film However this experience was short lived I don t know if it was the director s fault or the audience Perhaps you would witness this when you watch the film in the cinemas The plot takes us from one crises moment to another in a very entertaining fashion You will find yourself in certain instances holding your breath But when this dramatic device became more affective especially towards the end something happened The audience laughed collectively This did ruin the story s climax but I also understand what had pushed the audience to this unexpected reaction I know I m speaking with a sense of ambiguity however you will know what I mean when you witness the film s resolution I found myself asking then did they laugh because the journey was becoming too superficial and contrived Or was the audience unable to bear the series of bad luck that tipped them in a domino effect of relief to laugh it off In my honest opinion I think the director should have been more careful with the final hurdle It ruined the cinematic experience as the film can t be viewed in any other way Rounding up watch the movie Is it worth your money Absolutely,7
29 November 2019,A Complete Cinema,Alfonso Cuaron has done a very high level of technical work Particularly in the first half hour you are severely stretched The use of long plans made sense These long plans allow you to focus more on the film and experience the horror of those astronauts Watching on a small screen becomes a disaster You need to watch on a very good screen It is a great lesson to have such an impressive film from such a small subject and a simple script The realism part can of course be discussed Music is great to use The song in the film s finale is really good,10
16 December 2013,Hits the ground running and doesn't stop!,This movie started out big was fast and immense the whole way though tense and enthralling from beginning to end The introduction screen was so intense I laughed not knowing what else to do and was glued to the screen the entire rest of the movie They could have gone a lot of different directions the movie could have ended in a lot of different ways they could have added 10 or 15 minutes to the beginning or end extremely easily and they DID NOT There is no filler no background no epilogue and no break Everything a master book contains and none of the extra padding I m going back for a second viewing as soon as I can time some free time for a 3d showing because I saw it in 2d and it was well worth the money 10 stars,10
22 January 2014,Gravity A waste of money!,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,2
5 June 2014,a little space,I really enjoyed this movie and the effort and hard work it must have taken for some of the scenes I like the outer space element but it was predictable and didn t look realistic Bullock s characters fear seems to lighten quickly considering her predicament And the lines were a bit weak but for some reason despite all that I was totally taken in and liked it overall Maybe I m just to big a Bullock fan I think seeing it in 3D would help the film but a bit of help with the lines would really improve this more Clooneys lines as well The overall effect was awe and amazement at the thought of actually being lost in space but as the movie went on my enthusiasm lessened As did its believability And predictability Bullock was the only saving grace Seeing her float around in a spacesuit is worth the price of admission,6
23 February 2014,"Houston, I've got a good feeling about this picture.",It s Friday valentine s day all over the world and I decided to stay home to watch gravity with great expectations I have to say earlier this same day I had had to cover a coworker s English lab class at school where I teach English Since it is nearly the end of the school year I wanted to play gravity for them in the lab big screen But a 12 year old dissuaded me not to play on the basis she said of boredom she had experience at the local cinema I played a different movie instead She didn t put out my expectations on the film nevertheless So later I played the film in my place by myself And the film by itself proved to be a master piece All thanks to amazing writer director Alfonzo Cuaron and outstanding performance by Sandra Bullock Both giving merits to walk out with the gold at the academy awards this season The picture is dramatic edgy and well written The cinematography is great as well and the end reasonably satisfying I have many thoughts about this gem but I can t convey them into writing All I have to say in the end is Houston I got a good feeling about this picture The bottom line if you are a kid or are easily impressed this film might not be for you You may find it boring,9

10 January 2014,All brawn and no brains,Alfonso Cuar n has an impressive body of work including arguably the best Harry Potter film Prisoner of Azkaban and the dystopian Children of Men but unfortunately Gravity doesn t match the same level of cinema as these films Gravity is visually spectacular make no mistake about it but it fails as a human story The characters are so poorly developed especially Sandra Bullock s Ryan Stone that you find it hard to connect or even believe the clich d dialogue about loss and homesickness But perhaps the worst culprit is the premise which involves Russians taking out their own spy satellite whose debris annihilates not just the American shuttle but also the international and Chinese space stations I mean come on This is ineptitude of incredible proportions Also in my limited knowledge of space exploration the ease with which the astronauts jump from shuttles pods to hurtling space stations and the reentry all seem highly improbable given the mind boggling levels of precision required If you overlook these glaring flaws you end up with a reasonably entertaining film which gives the viewers a spectacular look into space exploration albeit one constructed on shaky scientific grounds If you re the nitpicking sort you re better off renting Apollo 13 6 5 10,6
6 January 2014,"Great film, shame about the Hollywoodiness",6 simply because of the wonderful depiction of space and what it might feel like floating above the Earth in a space suit surrounded by a few tools and machines that keep humans alive in unimaginably hostile nothingness Space is inexplicable this film transferred how it might feel to be human in that environment However Clooney although getting better with age reminded me of BuzzLightyear that turned me off him in the first place I think astronauts are professional scientists and Space is no place for a joker Bullock did an admirable job but adhered to the female stereotype as did Clooney the male counterbalance Basically it was too emotional and tried too hard to draw you in to an all too human drama when the vastness of space needed not the intensity of overpowering music to help you feel something Plot just went from bad to worse C mon we need it to be credible for pity s sake See it and see what I mean But see it it s stunningly beautiful,
21 April 2020,Gravity,Completely overwhelmed by the technical level photography sound scissors and mixing are impeccable Lovecraft said the oldest and strongest human emotion is fear and the oldest and strongest fear is the fear of the unknown The dark void of the universe is the source of fear It is because of this fear that I am unprepared to be hit by the traditional theme of Hollywood in the second half Karon used simple stories to lure out the most primitive human emotions,8

7 November 2013,A passionless review.,There are too many reviews on this film that either hate it or love it I don t agree with either Direction and Cinematography Very good Music and sound effects Very good Story and plot Good suspenseful but with flaws This type of film could have gone for 100 realistic and strive for perfection rather than try and be 50 realistic and 50 Hollywood fun but fake so as to try to allure audiences from both sides Acting I have to say mediocre I can t but compare Sandra Bullock to Sigourney Weaver in Alien A strong female battles for survival Well let s just say I wish this film was made back in the 80 s To be fair Bullock is very good in the movement part of her role P S No way is this the best film made in space Mr Cameron,6

19 January 2014,A Sci-fi movie with its own gravitas,Within its genre sci fi it has proved to be convincingly realistic and dramatic at the same time It maintains a good drama pace keeping many on the edge of their seats for 90 minutes The special effects are amazing but not for their own sake The whole production and special effects make the plausible story possible making the whole movie experience seamlessly entertaining and gripping The use of a limited cast in the vastness of space is perplexing and mind boggling to most moviegoers Years from now audiences will refer to this movie as a starting point when a new form of sci fi cinematography was capable of capturing a range of human emotions in a rather effective way,8
5 October 2013,very nice indeed,I was a bit reticent in the beginning considering Bullock s previous movies but i have to say the director made the right pick as her acting was truly impressive Also another nice thing about the movie is that they did not prolong the scenes unnecessarily things that tend to happen with actors like Bullock and Clooney It was actually quite captivating from beginning to the end and pretty much scientifically accurate So to sum it up considering the spectacular visual effects you really need to see it in 3d and the solid acting from both protagonists this makes an enjoyable experience especially for the sci fi genre buffs,9
4 December 2013,"Good Film, awesome effects, less talking please!",This was an incredible film visually it kept you on the seat of your pants throughout Sandra Bullock was a good fit to her part George Clooney however was in no way believable as an Astronaut Where the film was confident visually the dialogue really did not help I felt at the end as did my friend that it would have benefited from a lot less dialogue and back story which was not necessary at all and felt like a filler required for the majority audience If the film had been filmed in a foreign language and I had not understood a word it would have had more impact Great films that are suspenseful do not need dialogue to assist it is in the quiet and with the music and sound and visual views that one really gains a sense of Space The music was absolutely fantastic A good film but perhaps could have benefited with a little less Hollywood style influences,7

20 November 2013,An audiovisual marvel on a cliché pile,OK That is an anthropological behaviorism thesis all American critics have been thrilled with the movie while Europe and other parts of the globe not so much The exceptional ambiance of the film is constantly fighting against bad dialogue sultry family dramas nationalism and the heroic choir soundtrack It really is interesting to realize that the only poor reviews talk about unrealistic scenario science and physics wise while no one mentions the obvious pseudo heroic cocktail of epanaleptic superfluous easy Hollywood blockbuster doses Watch it in 3D though as it is meant to be watched a delight for your senses but please don give me crap about any depth whatsoever Yes James Cameron loved it I also love his films it s true entertainment not at all pretentious as in the case of Gravity and I do not seek any deeper meanings Mr Cuar n here would have loved to take his movie a bit further but some things are just not allowed in Hollywood,7

16 February 2014,A giant of a film!,For me a film is only ever as good as the actors actresses who hold it together and this film delivers hugely on both Starring basically George Clooney and Sandra Bullock the film centers around an issue with a satellite in space that they are up there to sort out I won t spoil it for you but at some point debris is sent hurtling towards them and they must rush to get out of its way and survive While i have seen better films in my life i have NOT seen anything as good in at least a year Its basic concept and small cast lead you on an intense journey that should have you on the edge of your seat at times I will say that in recent years there haven t been many films to keep my attention throughout but not only did this do it but it did it in a true classic film way hats off to everyone involved for giving us something worthwhile to watch again,9
20 February 2021,An orbital minefield forces astronauts to attempt an escape from space.,Effects were pretty but inaccuracy of the physics annoyed me at several moments most won t notice Some of these were key moments in the movie and inaccurate physics resulted in some immersion breaking mostly the inaccurate inertia Good acting as we would expect from Sandra Bullock 3 Plot is nice a single scene my film taking you through a specific crisis I wish the ending showed one step further in time but the danger felt real and I was along for the ride Decently good overall,7
8 October 2013,Intense,WOW This is a movie not to be missed The audio uses a Dolby technology called Atmos which provides a fully immersive experience The 3D video is impressive but not overdone The overall experience is almost like being there The scientific inaccuracies that some have reported can and should be overlooked after all it is still only a movie even if it does feel real It is was a very intense experience Not much to the storyline which is a matter of If something can go wrong it does but like most movies the heroine survives against all odds This is more than just a movie It s an event Awesome More than just a movie this is an event,10
1 December 2013,Only for those who like visual effects.,After seeing the mediocre trailer I had no desire to see this film however rave reviews had me interested so I took the opportunity to go Although visually stunning and beautifully acted the scripting is truly weak throughout the whole film obvious moments kept coming becoming very predictable and as a result quite boring My recommendation If you enjoy beautiful visual effects and graphics or in general are easily amused by the picture you ll love this However if you look for more than that in a film a great story great writing a great plot that keeps you entertained for the whole 2 hours that this film lasts beware because you might walk out disappointed I did,5

8 December 2013,The best horror movie without factious monsters.,In Alien by Ridley Scott horror and helplessness of a man in space and the prospect of a violent death were amplified from the clutches of a monster Cuaron who wrote the script Gravity get away without the fiction but made the Gravity one of the most terrific horror movies about the space Black abyss of interstellar space itself is an ideal medium for a thriller a place where no sound exists no top and bottom where it is almost impossible to control your movements and the probability of encountering something alive is zero Not to mention that there are no tools to survive All Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron had to do in this indifferent landscape is to place an experienced astronaut who about to retire and a woman who is a newbie to the space It would seem that with such an input data all that remains to the heroes is to beat their heads in panic or humbly wait for death suffocation Despite the utter hopelessness of the situation Kowalsky stays calm and tries to joke while Stone overcoming despair seeks to outline the homeland on the body of the planet But yes it is a story of survival in place categorically not suitable for life This is probably the only film today in which the presence of 3D technology not only justified but simply necessary 3D here performs its direct function it draws the viewer into the image allows to feel the horror of a man tumbling in space and who has no way to stop the rotation This awesome in all aspects movie is only spoiled by the set of disgusting Hollywoods formula with a mandatory American standard ending Where instead of profanity and hysteria Houston won t hear anyways encouraging imperatives and popular country music broadcast Heroes are utterly typical Stone is a direct descendant of Sgt Ripley and Kowalsky is an alien from a native childhood dreams of the most heroic profession,8
26 January 2014,"Good effects, Average Story.",The Movie contain nice effects experience best in 3D But if we talk about plot of the movie its average not so good nor so bad The film is set during a fictitious Shuttle Explorer s STS 157 mission The chain reaction occurs as the Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite which destroys the other satellites in the space The Crew members and their spaceship get destroyed The Sandra bullock George Clooney Struggle to survive While George Clooney detach the string which is loosely held by Sandra In order to save her Further than the story proceeds how Sandra reaches to next Chinese space station Which is 100 mi apart and how she came back to earth Somehow the plot was average but can be much better The effects are incredible Sandra George acted very well So here i rate it 8 out of 10,8
2 February 2014,The worst movie(?) i have ever seen,The movie starts stupid and ends even stupider You can wonder if it s so bad why it s rated so high well i tell you why Sandra bullock dammit uses a Chinese spacecraft for surviving while wearing a Russian spacesuit So all Russian and Chinese voted high and the movie rated high Maybe some teenager girls also voted high because the movie was obviously for them Sandra bullock should have died about 5 times in the movie but somehow she always survived i wanted so bad her to die in fire this was the only hope made me finish the movie but she survived again while she can t land the spacecraft even in the simulators she has done it in a real spacecraft so that was the last slap on my face and the movie ended finally,1
25 July 2020,Space,Is theres anything thats terrifying to me heights spiders drowning nothing is more terrifying than being lost in space Imagine it lost in space limited oxygen no gravity weird temperatures and nothing close to you to save you This is basically the premise of the film directed by Alfonso Cuaron who creates a suspenseful and one of the most amazingly shot films ever What I liked Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone in on a space mission with astronaut Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney Two veteran and incredibly well rounded actors playing characters in a terrible situation where their space shuttle is hit by debris of a fallen satellite For many moments in the film its a one woman show and Bullock delivers This is probably one of her most physical performances understandable considering what she had to do to prepare for this film The scale of the film is huge and so impressive The exterior focus such as suspense in space and the sense of wonder and mystery it brings is amazing The long takes are incredible as cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who worked with Cuaron on Children of Men and Y Tu Mama Tambien What I disliked Many may find the ending not plausible or that some scenes are consequential But i cant think of anything else Its such a simple story but the execution is incredible The less you know going into it the better I would tell people who ask about the film what I mentioned at the beginning of the review to allow them to gain the experience and truth of it themselves as it is more than just exploration of space,8
20 October 2013,terrible but entertaining,I was skeptical going in to this movie I thought it would be boring because it would all take place in space Another concern was that there were only two characters I later found out that was not how it failed the problem was that not much went on overall I think it would work better if there were more events leading up to were they had to abort there mission The events were dragged out by introducing new problems frequently Another main problem is that Koloski is lost early into the movie I think it would work much better if him and Ryan got separated near the end The drama was well done but did not have as much of an affect as it would of it wasn t constant Since this movie fails in plot it excels visually It was realistic looking and entertaining in that part I think that this movie is worth watching just because of the entertainment value,1
21 February 2014,An upper class lie,Some people say there world be no content in this movie but I think they are wrong But I think 99 of the people worldwide are not the target audience for this film But a lot of people do not understand this and tell everybody how wonderful it is and that the movie makers would avoid a political message But they are just wrong This movie is political motivated and Hollywood and the wall street boys give a about disputing problems in a time everything of the civilization is falling apart They just pay for arts showing someone privileged getting away from an alienated problem a problem not caused by themselves But in reality they won t be able to escape and their propaganda factory isn t believable any more A little bit of the subtext in Gravity is also shown in Children of men Cuar n avoids a philosophic discourse about class system human civilization and the search for reasons That is of cause because of the investors of his movies He is a casual writer working for the capital which makes the content of his movies a stupid lie,10
18 May 2020,Excellent technology,Movies on the theme of space have always been labeled with lofty labels such as the great footsteps of mankind science fiction and so on But the theme of this movie is escape The technology used in the movie is excellent Whether it is a fantasy depiction of vast space or a portrayal of the details of each spacecraft it gives us a very impactful experience But part of the plot of this movie also has contradictions with physics,8

23 February 2014,Can science and spirituality go hand in hand?,Enough been said about the impressive visuals and acting of the movie What I think is undermined is the message that the movie try to convey to the viewer To continue and fight in the face of a continuous and fervent adversary Here the adversary is the void space and we learn that it s such a dangerous yet mesmerizing place We can NOT call gravity a very scientific movie For instance traveling between shuttles and space stations is not possible because they orbit on different altitudes and inclinations On the other hand the movie is deeply spiritual I invite the viewer to note these incidents and try to connect them to the moments they happen 1 Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney talks about Ganges a holy river in Hinduism you should see the sun on the Ganges it s amazing at a very decisive part of the movie 2 We see a painting of Saint Christopher the saint of protection in Soyuz capsule these capsules are the only saviors in the space 3 We see Buddha status in the Chinese Shenzhou again in the capsule 4 The appearance of Matt Kowalski in Soyuz capsule P S I think this is the first time I ve seen Sandra Bullock not getting naked in a movie kinda disappointing as she promised us some action with Clooney,10

3 March 2014,Good drama but unrealistic,Picture 10 10 I cant say anything other than excellent it was very well executed Story 2 10 It was believable in the start but after the first few scenes things quickly made it into pure fiction While certain things were required to add to a thrilling experience the way they executed it made them unbelievable to me to the point of being a comedy Acting 8 10 Good acting but I got annoyed by Sandra Bullock a few times but most likely due to the poor plot rather than fault of the actor Overall everyone did very well My final score 5 10 If you don t care about realism and only want a good drama with an excellent picture this is a movie for you I however could not watch the whole movie without being frustrated about 4 5 details which I wont say here to ruin the experience Since I prioritize story when I watch movies I cant give this higher than a 3 of 10,3
10 December 2013,Good film but why is the hype OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!,A visual marvel depicting space as a place of great beauty yet great danger The stunning camera work flows majestically and is bound to win some sort of Oscar it really takes your mind away from the simple narrative of hopping from one space station to another with the films grand visual beauty The small cast heightens the sense of isolation and leaves you engaged throughout the movie for the most part The casting decisions for me are hit and miss it is understandable that this movie needed the biggest stars possible to draw in audiences and keep them engaged but on the other hand it is distracting seeing Bullock and Clooney two of the most recognisable actors in Hollywood playing astronauts so perhaps undiscovered talent would have been better off I hate ripping into a film that looks aesthetically pleasing but in the script department it is rather underwhelming why did George Clooney have to crack a joke about 10 million people losing their Facebook Lucky for Bullock half of her dialogue consists of grunts and groans must have been easy to learn those lines The 3D is also hit or miss sometimes it enhances the scene other times it just feels obnoxious such as the 3D tears coming towards your face The films most memorable scenes occur at the end I won t give away much but their are a few really great moments that provide genuine character depth more of this would have made it worthy of the hype this film has achieved Overall the film is extremely pretty much like Avatar it exceeds in visuals but provides little depth in characters and narrative making it a must see one off viewing at the cinema people are seriously missing out if they wait for the DVD or Blu ray because the film will lose much of it s majesty on the small screen The whole film kind off reminds me of a promotional demonstration for Imax cinemas which would showcase the great sound and visuals for Imax theatres,7
27 February 2014,Worth Watching,I wasn t entirely sure what to expect from this movie I hadn t heard a thing about it But I thought generally Bullock produces solid acting think The Blind Side where she single handedly carried the show Here with George Clooney as support it s a can t miss situation The story line is very basic trapped in space and I wanna go home not exactly rocket science story line still it works Clooney is the veteran style cowboy astronaut and Bullock is the tentative scientist apparently lured out to space to do a specialist job when the mission goes wrong and they need to return to earth The good stuff excellent score decent script solid special effects and top notch acting The script is basically all time deadline based which creates many suspenseful scenes with even a little comic relief thrown in It s not 2001 but it s worth watching Go watch it and enjoy don t be turned off by the haters,7
28 November 2013,Eye Popping,Gravity 8 5 10 Eye popping stuff When Avatar was made James Cameron said that he didn t want to overwhelm the audience with an overly complicated plot coupled with ground breaking visuals What we ended up with was Smurf Pocahontas in Space A film with two dimensional characters and a very bland script which is extremely forgettable Gravity offers a much more stripped down easy to follow and dare I say it realistic story line The characters are easier to relate to and fairly likable Any film that is predominantly designed to showcase new technology cinematic techniques is going to need a decent plot to go with it Gravity gets this just right Some of the best CGI work i ve ever seen The seamless blend of CGI and real elements is impressive to say the least Bullock holds the screen well not many actors actresses out there are capable of holding down such roles The performance doesn t quite portray the loneliness and isolation of being in space as well as Sam Rockwell does in Moon but it s a decent effort A film that NEEDS to be seen in 3D on the big screen,8
5 October 2013,Affected Only By Gravity,Wow I mean WOW Gravity is without a doubt the most mind blowing film I ve ever seen Storywise it s pretty simple a routine Hubble servicing mission turns into a fight for survival when a destroyed satellite floods LEO with 17 000 MPH debris and George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock both do a great job in their respective roles But the real genius of this film lies in its special effects INCREDIBLY long and complicated shots which totally generate a you are there feeling and PERFECT attention to detail Cuar n has taken Kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey to the next level and then some I dare say this puts even Blade Runner to shame in the amaze your eyeballs department although that movie is and always will be the pinnacle of pre CGI film The 3D is perfectly used especially in the spacesuit scenes If you can t actually GO to space this is the absolute next best thing I give Gravity a 10 out of 10 Go see it,10
28 February 2021,Expensive,Well it looks really expensive And the performances are fine as well But everything just feels so empty Like the vastness of space there is nothing to grasp onto And a ridiculous ending I d love to watch that with a bunch of astronauts,6
28 November 2013,There's No Gravity Here,I normally enjoy movies but this movie was so poorly put together that I had to make comments about it The storyline and its extremely poor scientific basis of portrayal is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a science fiction movie It seems the whole point to the story is to wow the audience with special effects If this was the Director s purpose he s succeeded However a motion picture should have a believable story that ties together to the end This movie did not even come close to achieving that What a waste of time and money Were there really any scientific advisers to the film crew Apparently not,1

14 July 2014,"Space movie aimed at very general audience, with little care for detail",Boy I am glad I downloaded this movie instead of buying it After all the hype around it even on this website it is currently rated at 8 10 stars I would have thought it was the best movie of 2013 But as I began to watch the film I started wondering how on Earth no pun intended this movie could have possible been nominated for accolades such as Best Picture and Best Director The first thing that struck out to me were the physical impossibilities rampant throughout the film Ryan the protagonist flies off of the space arm and spins off into space yet somehow a mere ten seconds later her spin has slowed considerably Or what about how the parachute opens later in the movie IN SPACE That is impossible Perhaps the biggest fault in the movie was simply how unlikely the entire plot was A chunk of debris is flying around the earth at 6 miles per second No way can you spot that with your naked eye and no way EACH AND EVERY satellite and space station orbiting the earth just happens to orbit along the same path No way Ryan would be able to move from one space station to another No way My biggest complaint with the film was how emotional unstable Ryan was How did she manage to get selected to go into space with only six months of training and a recently deceased daughter For the amount of hysterics and silly monologue viewers must endure one can only come to the conclusion that Ryan is not suitable for being an astronaut and would have never been chosen in the first place To end on a positive note the graphics were quite good like most other reviews claim I was impressed with the space stations and the depiction of earth In conclusion do not waste your time on this so called Greatest Space Movie Of All Time,2
26 October 2013,"So women can't drive - is that your point, Mr. Cuaron?",I was disappointed by this movie The plot is a dumbed down version of Apollo 13 Unrealistic elements abound Every seven year old can spot the flaws The character of Ryan Stone is so incompetent it is annoying While the acting impersonating a stupid character may be great the character itself is an abomination and spoils the entire movie No space agency would launch such a person into space Or perhaps the director wants to show that women cannot drive Some say that the visuals are great Yes they are but we have seen it all before Avatar and a hundred other films have great visuals So that is not enough I give it 3 10 because I was on the verge of walking out the theatre,
28 July 2014,Watch 'Apollo 13' or ''Alien' instead,at least those movies are consistent Forget the Physics some good but mostly laughable just the Culture of the astronauts and mission specialists is just wrong wrong wrong When the Challenger exploded the astronauts had the presence of mind to use their oxygen masks even though they knew they were doomed I bet SCUBA divers just roll their eyes thinking WTF when they watch Bullock and Clooney make their way to the Intl Space Station don t talk concentrate on not panicking breathe deliberately to conserve oxygen This movie needs better Writers and less Special Effects This movie is as phony as Fox News,5
27 August 2018,A Weak Force That Holds Planet In Line...,Okay so the plot is paper thin and its really short But saying the visuals are good is like saying Hitler was a bit of a wrong un I still consider this the most amazed I ve ever been watching a movie The stunning 3D effects the clever use of sound or lack of sound in most cases and the stress inducing score make for a unique experience in my opinion anyway Does it bear repeat viewing on TV Not really Was it worth seeing in 3D in the cinema Absolutely,8

7 January 2014,Best film of the decade!,Jesus Christ what a ride it came out on BLURAY today so i finally got to watch it thank God i didn t watch many trailers previews and tried to avoid anything i read which had to do with the movie i don t want a second watch to call a it a masterpiece and also it took the 1 from Wof of Wall Street and became my new favorite of the year aka decade Oh my God didn t expect that AT ALL i felt like i was watching it for 30 40 minutes i don t regret not seeing this in theaters cause i don t think i liked so mush watching with an audience but i think if a had 3D TV i couldn t get it off my mind for a very very very long time not that now will do but just saying and what a hell of a score seriously i had to cry like this since The Lord Of The Rings that s it,10
10 December 2013,"Great visuals, intense moments... and nothing more",I gave Gravity a 6 mainly for the visuals Other than that there isn t much of anything here Gravity is a nail biter for sure The problem is that s all it is It s 90 minutes of edge of your seat moments strung together We learn next to nothing about the only two characters in the movie so there is no emotional investment whatsoever I honestly didn t care much whether the characters lived or died There s no story either It s basically 3 real time hours of space survival crammed into 90 minutes And by space survival I mean floating around trying to grab onto things while watching for space debris There s your movie Gravity makes a mild attempt at being philosophical and falls short And the message it tries to convey is one we ve all heard before particularly in Shawshank Redemption No story no character development just 90 minutes of stressful nail biting moments Yes it s a beautiful looking movie The visuals are amazing But amazing visuals don t make a movie amazing If you re a sci fi geek or just in the mood for an intense edge of your seat movie give Gravity a go But if you re looking for a movie that cares about more than just visuals and intense moments look elsewhere,6
28 February 2014,The Hype is better than the movie,Bought the 3D Blu ray and watched it at home Many scientific and technical flaws lack of character development and unfunny jokes overshadowed the special effects I was also very disappointed in a 91 minute running time I just couldn t accept George Clooney as an astronaut Sandra Bullock was believable and did a great job with what she was given to work with More background info on her character s personal life would have helped this viewer in understanding her mindset Better space movies are 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 Sunshine 2007 and Silent Running 1972,2
4 March 2014,One Word Describes It All....,Yawn However the special F X were very good and the only reason I rated 3 stars Did a grade schooler write this movie How on earth did this thing receive so many awards So many inaccuracies So little plot movement So much Sandra Bullock grunting It was so boring my girlfriend made me turn it off and I had to watch the rest of the next day alone LOL I didn t get to watch it in 3D but I imagine it would have enhanced my viewing pleasure quite a bit The weightlessness F X were superb I d file this one under Movies to Nap By Cheers,3

4 February 2014,"See it for its technical marvels, but this film's significance will fade with time.",Gravity 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuaron explores the emotionally grueling experiences of a medical engineer Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock who has been sent up into space to service the Hubble space telescope alongside veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski George Clooney and flight engineer Shariff Dasari Paul Sharma Things begin to go awry when Houston advises the crew that the Russians have destroyed a satellite with a missile strike which has resulted in a chain reaction of space debris orbiting the planet at their altitude This debris eventually hits their location and destroys the shuttle marooning the remaining crew members at an altitude of 559 kilometers The film takes on the perspective of Dr Stone as she uses her wits and limited training to find a way to get back to Earth The actual narrative is pretty bare but this is a non issue to me given that it is a film about a personal journey Why did Russia blow up a satellite What is the political environment at the time of this film which takes place in the near future We don t know but we don t need to know This film isn t about the context of the situation but the situation itself The film more or less is paced in real time and thus eliminates the need for exposition to fill gaps of time that we do not witness The first 10 minutes or so of this film has one of the most technically advanced sequences that you will ever see on the big screen For me it brought back memories of Cuaron s Children of Men 2006 which had a car sequence involving a flaming tree machine gunners on dirt bikes and a ping pong ball that at the time was one of the most impressive interpretations of the long take that I had ever seen The opening sequence of Gravity is no less impressive with zero gravity acrobatics providing a visceral experience that may very well be the closest many of us ever come to floating in space Additionally Sandra Bullock s acting is as good as we have ever seen from her She s a natural at playing a neurotic character brought into extraordinary circumstances Think of Bullock s portrayal of Dr Stone as a more seasoned and mature interpretation of her role as Annie Porter in Speed 1994 Gravity sees her tread a more pronounced character arc but both films highlight the emotional highs and lows that Bullock can take the audience There is one sequence in particular that I feel will resonate for most people For the sake of avoiding spoilers I ll be relatively non descript and just say that this scene involves her character using a radio to communicate with Houston at what appears to be her lowest moment only to find that she has tapped into the signal of an Inuit fisherman This man Dr Stone s only connection to Earth then begins to sing a bed time song for his child Bullock s character feeling that there is no hope for survival begins to use the song to comfort herself in one of the most beautiful and devastating scenes in the film There is little doubt that the film is a technical masterpiece with solid performances but I feel that where the film falls flat is in its incessant need to entertain the viewers with zero gravity explosions and tense sequence after tense sequence I was certainly swept up in the theatrics of it all for the first half but towards the end the misadventures of Dr Stone start to become tiresome and unbelievable Now I understand that this film is about overcoming impossible odds but I feel the filmmakers passed a threshold when it comes to suspended disbelief By the end I was holding myself back from shouting Oh come on in the theater At one point a woman beside me let out some exhausted laughter over the lead character s rotten luck This ultimately took me out of the experience and made me very aware that I was watching a movie There are other minor issues that I have with Gravity including a ham fisted homage to 2001 A Space Odyssey but what really resulted in me leaving the cinema disappointed was that I went into this film hoping that this could be added to the canon of great sci fi To me sci fi is at its best when it deals with very complex or controversial ideas or when it s used as a societal critique Gravity is more of an action film set in space Don t misunderstand me it s a good action film peppered with moments of artistic brilliance but I don t see it being remembered and revered in the decades to come Final verdict 3 5 out of 5 Read this review and more at http cinemacave blogspot ca,7

This is called ""great budget""",This is not called a good movie This is called great budget End of the story Special effects should not affect movies reviews they come after Anyone could have written this movie I don t enjoy a movie if it s all about 3D graphics I don t really care about the effects This movie has got nothing to tell nothing new nothing original nothing to teach Its reviews are good because of the money spent on it and the feelings that the special effects give,6
19 March 2014,Hugely disappointed,I had great expectations for this movie especially cause it won so many awards But seriously what a disappointment It contains nothing but beautiful images from above which is the only plus I can think of The story if there ever was one is so thin that I really couldn t care less what happened in the end to any of the 3 characters The awards this movies received must have been bought and paid for I would not recommend any one to spend any of their hard earned money for this movie Their money would be much better spend at some real NASA showcase or Discovery program about space,2
21 November 2014,gravity reviews,first time i see the trailer of this movie i m so excited and wait for the movie to come out but when i see the movie i think this movie a little bit boring the character Dr stone at the beginning of the movie she said to be the most genius among its comrade but she to dumb to use a lot of her oxygen she s to panic to become the astronaut why N A S A put her on the space if he doesn t have a good psychology i think the director should be more realistic about the real event Dr stone is to nervous shes to mellow compared to her comrade he was calm identify the situation carefully Gravity has a heck of a lot going for it First of all it s a great survival story It follows in the footsteps of Apollo 13 Cast Away The Grey and many other tales of man or in this case woman vs nature There are a lot of horrific ways to die and spinning off into space has got to be pretty high up there no pun intended Gravity takes that basic fear of helplessness and uses it to underpin every action scene in this movie I m an action movie aficionado and I can t remember the last time a movie made me hold my breath like Gravity did And there are few environments as unique deadly and beautiful as space to set a survival story in If you re a fan of action or survival dramas you ll really enjoy this,2

22 February 2014,Not another disaster movie,If this film had something to make me think about after it I might have been more enthusiastic But in the end to me this is just another special effects disaster movie Boring Sandra Bullock in a space uniform is the first problem Snicker Hello can anybody hear me Maybe they did and didn t want to answer her because I wouldn t hearing that shallow whining voice And George Clooney is to me even less believable Great special effects is all this movie has to offer if you turn the sound off What really bothers me is that it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards I suppose that what this business has become awards for what appeals to those who would never see Kubrick s 2001 but generates lots of cash,5
25 October 2013,Could have been a great 5min short,The music made my ears hurt I preferred the dead space silence The acting was irrelevant in the utter disaster of a script with clich dialog The only way this movie could possibly be good is if Ryan continued spinning out into space after the first incident What was with all the slamming into things all the time And all the dramatic pauses at the most inappropriate times I felt like I sat through the same disaster 3 times only for her to score an extremely improbably lucky landing in the end Nothing about this movie makes any sense at all My advice smoke a big fat joint before you watch this movie and take earplugs or don t watch it at all Also not worth the 3D headache,3
2 February 2014,"Stunningly pretty, but dull as dishwater",Relying on CGI and breath taking shots doesn t cut it for me Sorry Felt nothing for George Clooneys character and very little for Sandra Bullocks character Mission specialist Dr Ryan Stone who s first space mission turns spectacularly disastrous Although the cinematic sequence WERE breath taking I didn t have the pleasure of watching this in 3D or at an IMAX and couldn t help thinking how much I was missing out on visually That said visuals aren t the be all and end all to a great movie Gravity is one of those films that should rely on facts and reality but was too far fetched to be enjoyed I felt this film was comparable to Redfords All is lost Nice touch by having Ed Harris voicing mission control see Apollo 13,4

5 November 2013,Beautifully and masterfully directed/acted,Really an incredible movie Heart pounding and riveting to say the least The film pulled me in a couple minutes into it and held me there straight to the ending credits The acting especially by Sandra Bullock was incredible And George Clooney did a great job too he added a light comedic edge I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and I wouldn t recommend watching it any other way There s something about IMAX that just makes the movie so much more realistic and it makes you feel like you re in the movie with the characters I never was really into 3D because it was usually uncomfortable but the Gravity experience with 3D was incredible,8

20 February 2020,Average space movie,Storyline was really wacky and was not infested to it for a little bit Visuals were quite awesome but the story should have been better with that budget 2017,6
8 November 2013,Definitely worth the watch!,The film keeps you interested in an interesting way It seems like the kind of film that wouldn t have much to other with the basic story line but the overall experience is pulled off phenomenally With a few minor things here and there where you feel as if the character is just doing silly things so that the story line can be dragged out a little longer it was still suspenseful almost every time I m not going to spoil the ending but I will say that I have mixed feelings about it even though it was good it feels as if it was cut off a little short The visuals were stunning and I would easily believe it was actually shot in space if I didn t know any better Overall a fantastic film But it does have its small and minor issues Definitely worth the watch,8

15 October 2013,Sandra Bullock and A Series of Unfortunate Events,That s the movie in a nutshell Disaster strikes less that 10 minutes into the movie and just doesn t let up It was tense and edge of the seat for a while but got extremely predictable half way through Sadly the story doesn t evolve into into something bigger better I can t believe the hype around this movie For me it didn t come anywhere close the drama in Apollo 13 or Moon both of which I found riveting On all technical and production aspects this movie gets high marks This is the most authentic looking space exploration movie yet The way they ve depicted objects interaction with each other in space is frankly astounding Great cinematography and score This movie should be quite an Oscar contender for the technical awards,6
13 October 2013,The Gravity Review,Wow Wasn t That a mind blowing film The Scenes made you feel like you were up in space floating around with the characters Sandra Bullock definitely deserves a award for this Movie The movie is a disarmingly low key drama of two U S shuttle voyagers played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock at their most emotionally grounded who wind up lost in space with no warp speed or wizardry to help them For all the viewers that love a movie to give you a feel of the outside world watch it The film has broken a new money making record for the October season making more 55 million on the box office Gravity will take this award as a new genre is formed Space movies really take you on a thrill ride leaving you feeling lucky for the non gravity atmosphere we now have today The 3D version is recommended to the people looking forward to seeing the film Ebony Rose,9
24 January 2014,Quite boring and weak plot....,I actually went to watch this at cinema since it had so many good reviews but what I saw was completely different from what the reviews say This was rather boring the plot was weak and you can relate it to a sht loads of movies released during the 90s about being lost in space The ending of the movie makes you realise how much of a waste of time this was to begin with I felt as if the time I spend watching this movie is precious time I can never get back the one thing I hate it was how she could survive in space for such a freaking long time with a standard air supply which could in reality not last half the time she was lost in space for the movie had way too many flaws and during quite a few scenes it defies the laws of gravity OK lets just say space that it looses credibility It was a screening that held over 200 people at the O2 in London and my god the majority left with a disappointed face I cannot disagree with them since I can understand their reasons This cannot be considered a master piece and should not have such rating as there are far better movies underestimated by those who believe themselves to be the pure intellectual geniuses of society get real people,1
12 September 2021,An anti-feminist movie,The main character is so stupid and behaves like someone with a hatred of women would think they do Within the first 3 minute you hope the main character dies swiftly so you can enjoy the rest of the movie but alas the suffering goes on at least another 90 minutes,2
4 October 2013,GRAVITY.... This is what cinema is all about!!!,Gravity is pure Cinematic Brilliance Words Cant describe this film The acting was phenomenal by both George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock Oscar worthy performances The special effects were insanely awesome and the story takes you on a roller coaster full of emotions You feel like your living the moment in space with the characters You even get tight chested as if you were loosing air and get filled with anxiety Its a MUST WATCH piece of art This is what cinema is all about A film you must experience in 3D Two thumbs up Alfonso Cuaron Def a contender for best Picture and Best Director for 2014 Academy Awards,10
23 July 2020,GRAVITY Film Review,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,8
18 November 2013,Worth seeing in theaters,Gravity has been the only satisfying blockbuster sci fi film of 2013 although some might argue it s too light on the science and heavy on the adventure ride This is only true if you consider warp drives more science fiction than a space shuttle because it s no less accurate than more futuristic sci fi movies and shows tend to be The acting and dialog is pretty good but the focus of this movie is the experience of watching it As even real astronauts have commented the brilliant cinematography sound and visual effects capture the experience in a profound way I was completely sucked in Unfortunately the reliance on effects to achieve immersion means that I doubt this movie would be very satisfying at home on a normal TV Without a big screen and good surround sound it would lose a lot of its appeal,8
26 October 2013,"Masala Story is nothing to write home about, still go and watch in 3D if you want to experience outer space",The 3D and experience of outer space is quite realistic and this is the reason I had gone to the movie The story is not great and there are a lot of instances of forced co incidence and contrived situations Reality is boring I know but this was a bit on the high side However the movie does show that space is not as glamorous as it is made out to be and it can be a dangerous and lonely place Being from a science background I could not help but remember Newtons 3 laws of motion especially how the 1st one is illustrated quite well objects keep moving in perpetual motion merrily in a constant perpetual merry go round Bottomline Go if you want to experience space in 3D with a little bit of story to it however do not go for the story alone,7
29 December 2022,"Overall a good film, down to earth",Three astronauts is in space When Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Sheriff are repairing the Hubble Telescope Matt Kowalski George Clooney a veteran astronout and the commander of the space shutter Explorer is giving them company He continuously talks to Ryan in between explorer captain and mission control Now reports are received that space debris are coming forth towards them they have to leave the mission there All dies in the shuttle But Ryan and Kowalski manage to survive in this disastrous situation They reach near ISS where Matt releases himself in the space to save Ryan The sole survivor of STS 157 Ryan have to return to the earth using Shenzhou space craft There is hardly a transition effect in this film Which depict that How is so important in this film Must say that the film has a great continuity and becomes a one character movie in the end To portray the space director uses reflections lights sound everything Kowalski once says to Ryan You gotta admit one thing can t beat the view,7
12 April 2015,Great fun,I found myself trembling through three quarters of the entire film I m glad it won as many awards as it did Set entirely in space Sandra Bullock George Clooney make a great duo There should be more films like this then again there d be too many copied ideas Particularly in the first half of the film where most of the action took place I found myself trembling on the edge of my seat there were a couple of moments where I was absolutely wetting myself in fear not literally As I previously mentioned this film deserved the amount of awards it did a worthy winner,9
13 July 2014,Poor story + mediocre acting + amateur CGI = Horrible Movie,First thing that comes to mind when you start watching this movie is how Sandra Bullock ruined her face so badly Her plastic surgery is so bad that she looks like she s wearing a mask Put her face together with her stuck up crazy liberal personality and you have a person of little worth She does nothing to redeem herself with her acting in this movie On the other hand you have another wacko liberal George Clooney whose acting is still barely fit for a cheap TV sitcom It takes little common sense to know how dumb the idea of this whole movie is Here these astronauts are speeding around space in space suits navigating their way around doomed space stations etc No amount of movie magic can make the elements of this movie believable It s just a really really poor movie There are certainly worse movies but this one barely meets the margin of the absolute worst movie categories Obviously these wacky bunch of Hollywood liberals have become so arrogant that they expect their movies to be hailed as the greatest just because they are in them,3
22 May 2015,"Gravity ...beautiful, artistic, sci-fi drama",This is a sci fi movie that is outstandingly good in terms of story limited characters pacing action sequences and the gorgeous cinematography Regarding the special effects used it is one of the best that I have ever seen and looked amazing in both 2G and 3G The camera shots are graceful and moves effortlessly between close to the lead character s viewpoint to general views I enjoyed the film s sound effects and score it had a fresh sound with subtle classical tones and just the right build up to climatic sequences The lead and supporting characters are great on screen played by Sandra Bullock Ryan Stone and George Clooney Matt Kowalski respectively Their chemistry and on screen banter was excellent The film albeit with less characters to show for on screen and therefore less dialogue makes the conversations that would take place all the more important and interesting The story had me gripped and kept my interest throughout although I only really appreciated the lead character more so upon second viewing perhaps from being slightly distracted by the photography and action effects The director and all the people involved had a clear vision of how to make this movie well ahead of it s time it was made to look as if the actual film crew were in space filming the sequences it is that good The extras on my Blu ray certainly indicated this was a bold attempt at filmmaking from direction to acting and every element in between there was hard work meticulous preparation and a lot of thought into how to make the film sequences as real and engaging as possible I will watch this movie time and again,9
9 December 2013,Boring?,Well I know a lot of people liked this movie and I don t mind I just hoped I d like it as well The visuals are great What I liked most about it was that it felt very real there are no super technologized fiction machines so you get to fully enjoy the out in the space experience and in this it excels Don t think any other movie provides same level of atmospheric mood that is gently contained within believable limits However with all that appreciated I was constantly bugged by the simplicity of where things were going and how it all turned out First the movie starts with three astronauts fixing a machine part in the space two man one woman The woman is the one fixing stuff one of the guys is the commander They receive an alarm to abort but the woman keeps fixing it with just a moment clich Then things go wrong So if up until this I was genuinely enjoying the realness of it all now I am watching somebody who was actually allowed into outer space to fix a machine postponing orders Okey she is trained for just 6 months but following orders should take about a minute to memorize Skipping it At some point the movie starts to shift from this is about space to this is about me And the rest of it feels more like watching a person s journey to self development more than anything else The other characters are thrown off very easily The spiritual aspect of the movie is OK I mean facing your own demons overcoming something and learning to move on is indeed important but not in any way original new or brilliant for a movie Even if it happens in the outer space So to wrap it up I m not sure how I felt about the change in the movie I know I was supposed to care for the main character but I was more annoyed at her for putting everyone s lives at risk I just didn t find anything in particular amazing about the movie Atmospheric movies require some patience in general but with the plot very predictable the only thing I was left with were the visuals and for that 6 10,6
13 July 2020,Great Performance,Just Watched this movie in 2020 during Corona Virus It was Realised in 2013 still VFX Graphics and CGI are Superb That s Why Hollywood is 10 Times ahead of Bollywood I liked the Movie and loved the performance of the Girl The is About Survival in Space and stay Alive because there is Still Hope nothing is Impossible The Ending was Lit,7
1 September 2023,A film that entertains on a regular basis.,Watching Gravidade I felt immersed in the story that the film wanted to convey at no point did I think that it accelerated or slowed down it remained constant during its two hours The performances are good and the setting soundtrack and visual effects deliver a lot too Usually movies in space can feel dull or dull visually after a while but as the movie progresses it manages to break that obstacle The plot is pleasant but with scenes that force our will to believe in some passages too much but it is possible to reveal the entertainment that the work brings A family film that satisfies for the time watched,7

7 March 2021,Agravic,It is some time ago that I have seen that movie but what I still remember is this I did not enjoy it Might it be that the watcher of this movie should also suffer like the protagonist or whatever the director s intention was I nearly could not await the end of the movie It had nice effects but there was no plot or at least a plot that could catch my attention I was bored perhaps this is how it is in space when you are alone But I cannot imagine why so many critics and users rated this movie 7 or more At best it is a movie to pass the time But it could be that you won t enjoy it I wonder why such famous actors accepted to be part of this movie what might have been their reasoning I hope they could see something I cannot and enjoyed making it,3

16 March 2014,Plot less and dull,I love science and science fiction but this movie just did not do anything for me Without writing a spoiler I could not find a plot in which someone could write a full movie script there was no empathy towards characters when the bad stuff happened and the ending was cut short I don t often write reviews because everybody has different opinions and I always like to disregard them all and judge for myself whether I like it or not but I do feel like this movie wasted 90 minutes of my life Yes the CGI was good but no more impressive than other films coming out recently so what did this really have to offer A full celebrity A List cast With only two characters in the entire film that doesn t really say much Watch it for yourself you may like it I may just be the one person that doesn t but at least I ve said my bit,2
31 October 2013,A good movie with amazing visuals and a little too melodramatic for its own good.,With George Clooney as the moral anchor the visuals are a treat and manages to take you along on the spacewalk But at times the movie tends to be melodramatic especially when they want to make the scene look symbolically significant But i guess one gotta give the director creative license when he has succeeded in holding your attention for an odd 91 minutes The moral message of the movie is beautiful and kind of put things in perspective PS For those of you who are scientifically inclined you would have to suspend disbelief and discount some of the science in the movie As the movie is about the transformation journey Sandra Bullock takes and not about the Science,8

1 May 2018,You don't see the bigger picture,I know lots of people found this film very disappointing but I can t see why This film was obviously for the visuals and supposed to make you feel like you re in space If you can appreciate the film for what it was then it really isn t that bad Don t look for action or plot this is not what this film is producing And who cares about the acting Sandra Bullock did a fine job The film tries to show you what the experience of being in space is like and how scary it can be It was very well paced and the obstacles the character Ryan Stone came across was very thrilling Also it was very atmospheric because of how silent the film was with some parts of the film,9
2 March 2021,One of the best films of 2013!,The plot of the film is very good excellent audiovisual one of the best and actors of great quality I recommend it and a lot,10
19 October 2013,"Beautiful visuals, hell of a storyline",At first I must admit that I am not a big fan of Bullock and Clooney Because of al the great reviews around I decided to watch this movie in 3D The starting scene is visually amazing it takes about 15 minutes of continuous filming Somewhat similar of what we have seen in earlier films of guaron After this scene we soon realize that the storyline has nothing even remotely interesting to offer Even if you let aside the credibility of occurring events there is no character development even present The only thing we get to know about one of the characters couldn t have been easier No creativity involved The story development and ending is so bad it might as well have been the story of Adam sandlers latest rom com Aside from this really bad storyline the visuals are unlike anything I have ever seen Generally I am not to fond of 3D movies because it doesn t add anything to the quality of the movie but at this movie it really improves everything you see The amount of attention paid to details in every shot is also amazing I think you can watch the scenes in the space stations a couple times and still discover new details Summing these things up I think it is a big shame that the storyline hasn t been developed more The characters were very very thin Although I can understand why they cast Clooney and Bullock budget sponsor wise I think the movie would have been a lot better with characters with a less Hollywood feel I would definitely recommend seeing this movie but see it in cinema in 3D Expect a space documentary and you ll be amazed by the details and viewpoints,5
6 October 2013,"Nice, but...",The movie is visually beautiful and tense but it takes as much care about laws of physics as Harry Potter serial does To avoid spoilers I won t be too specific but watching the movie reader will understand Rule of thumb avoiding technicalities to maintain stable orbit on certain altitude object needs to have specific angular speed relative to the center of the earth For example ISS performs DAP avoidance procedures moving significantly up or down by increasing or decreasing speed by 1m s Therefore when increasing speed object will move in higher orbit decreasing speed it will move to lower orbit Aiming at space station from 100 miles distance and then accelerating significantly in its direction wouldn t bring you anywhere near it If the orbits were perfectly aligned one would end up few miles above of below it Disregarding that approaching station with speed difference of let s guess 30m s isn t good idea If aimed correctly astronaut would end up as fly on windshield with or without auxiliary source of thrust Cloud of debris due to earlier mentioned rule can t return on the same place unless orbits were perfectly aligned in opposite direction Besides If speed of debris differs from target they would move to different orbit Just to mention that Hubble orbits almost 100 miles above ISS with different inclination Moving between those two orbits is very complex task requiring quite lot of calculation Still after accepting Harry Potter as reality standard I like the movie,6

16 August 2021,Breathtaking ride,I really liked the movie I liked that it showcased the inherent problems in a no gravity environment especially for Sandra Bullock s character who is inexperienced in space We take for granted that when we let go of something it falls to the ground And when we start moving we will eventually slow down That isn t the case in space Plus the problem they encounter in the movie seems plausible I don t know how realistic it would be for that problem to occur but at least they are not fighting Martians,9
4 October 2013,New era in film is born,This film breaks new ground both in genre and special effects It is a soulful and life changing experience to watch If in the back of your mind you have ever asked yourself what a film would be like if its director really did shoot it in space then you need to see Gravity This is the first hyper reality space epic so true to life so realistic so immaculately conceived that our vision of space is brought from the blurry hypothetical s of past science fiction into violently acute focus on the kinetic minimalism of a true space experience From now on all footage in space will be defined as before Cuar n s Gravity or after Cuar n s Gravity This will inevitably apply to TV and documentaries as well as film I can t wait until the director s cut which I pray will be at least 3 hours long,10
9 October 2013,A movie (almost) completely (literally) made in space,Amazing One of the best movies I should not forget Apollo 13 about space and spaceships Mainly two characters but yet a super story Another excellent point of the movie is the musics and sounds Of course 3D was nice but I suppose it could be better in some scenes I am not sure how realistic Sandra Bullock s costume is but it didn t bother me at all I missed Clooney for the rest of the movie Only problem I am having through the movie is loosing George Clooney Science cannot be true at that point He should not have any weight in the free space And fire Well I am not writing a spoiler However a very good investment Obviously I would recommend it,7
4 June 2019,While it is a good movie...,It s pretty forgettable I don t know why but it just is for me,8
11 February 2014,Unbelievable space waste!,People This is not a good movie First of all this is typical American crab Where was the fluttery flag I probably missed it When things start to go wrong there is no time to cry for Argentina its just stupid waste of time You React goddamn These monologues of Sandra made me wanna vomit and her acting was what can one say same as always poor The only good thing about the movie was the effects and those should win something but for a 100 million there should be some acting and script writing as well So the rest of the flick was a total screwup And the rating 8 2 I cant believe why people vote for this more than five No way Jose Sadly this probably wins Oscar or two but that is just not right,4
22 October 2013,Gravity: A movie that has weight,Gravity keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from beginning to end Unexpected events occur every few minutes that fuel plot twists to make this movie worth seeing more than once Sandra Bullock s exceptional performance could ring up another Academy nod for her George Clooney s monotonous interludes with Bullock subtract from an otherwise excellent movie Reminiscent of the movie Marooned Gravity never runs out of energy as the characters play out a well written script Millions have already seen Gravity and the reviews have been extremely positive I must restrain myself from revealing the plot to allow the reader to view Gravity from a fresh perspective Look for this movie to win multiple awards few others have equaled it this year Mark Davis MD your roving media critic twitter com americassage,8
15 December 2014,Not Perfect but Gripping,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,7
19 October 2013,What movie did these people see?,We paid 32 16 each to see this in IMax 3D After the hype on media we thought maybe this will be something special What a disappointment Better to wait and see it on DVD if you must The 3D effects were amateurish at best If you lift your glasses the movie looks basically the same If you ever saw 2010 the floating pencil the effects are the same And if you ever saw the 3D show at Disney World in the 1990s the not so special effects in Gravity are worse And the 3D effects are the best thing about the movie There is little if any plot OMG we re being assaulted by space debris We have to get some place safe Opps somebody died there Same plot over and over No surprises there I like Sandra Bullock and George Clooney but maybe this would have been more believable with unknown actors in the parts On second thought no actors could help this movie It s a perfect example of The Emperor s New Clothes Tell them this is the best movie of the year and they will see what they are told Hollywood save money on scripts like this and remake Metroplolis or 2001,2
17 July 2014,Go see,This was an amazing space film Gravity is as jaw dropping spectacular film as you ve heard It s magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone Sandra Bullock did an amazing job basically carrying an entire film on her back Sandra and George have amazing chemistry I would love to see them in more films together The cinematography was fantastic After watching the film and doing my research and learning how the non gravity affect came into play I was completely blown away with the genius of this film I wish Sandra would have won an Oscar for this film but there s always next year for her to give another amazing performance,8

2 March 2014,"""Houston... We Have A Few Problems!""",The script was very average The plot didn t offer anything innovative I don t think a person will look back 10 years later and say Gravity what a timeless gem It just isn t that kind of movie I think the effects covered over the cracks of a very mediocre film On the other hand the good things about Gravity It is well acted This film really did depend on two main roles Clooney and Bullock portrayed their characters very effectively In my opinion one of the most likable characters Clooney has ever portrayed The special effects are outstanding I went to see this in cinema and yes sometimes you would forget you are on planet earth The lighting sound cinematography and the design was sharp I liked the tone Alfonso Cuar n sets but I do think the story dropped off in a few places I can see why some found it a bit dull and boring It is a good sci fi flick however the script was a real let down because it could have been so much better But don t leave that turn you off go and see it for yourself It is worth the watch,6
6 October 2013,Not so good!,I went to see this movie expecting a masterpiece considering the reviews on IMDb What I found was a good but not great movie experience The good things about this movie are the spectacular scenes from the Earth as well as all the techniques used to make it names of which I don t even know But I think it lacks a strong story and character development You get almost no background information on the characters and all that happens in the movie is bumping into stuff and surviving them I didn t even get enough action and excitement I also think some of Sandra Bullock s lines did not exactly make sense I mean who would take the time and energy to talk like that in a life and death situation,7

5 January 2014,You can't beat the view !!!,When I first saw the trailer of Gravity sometime around mid 2013 I had to add it to my must see upcoming films immediately because it seemed something different and gave me the feeling that we all would get to see something which we haven t seen before And then I did get further excited after hearing everyone go gaga about it after the release in October 2013 Talking about my own experience well for the first few minutes it felt like I was watching just another picture of the earth and satellites But within no time the feeling changed Felt like I was myself drifting into outer space And I m sure anyone who has seen this movie in 3D on the big screen will agree that Gravity is not just another movie but an experience I can t recollect any other movie with a cast as small as Gravity s And that s what the film is all about George Clooney Sandra Bullock and the vast expanse we call as outer space I couldn t agree with James Cameron when I read his words about the film I think it s the best space photography ever done I think it s the best space film ever done and it s the movie I ve been hungry to see for an awful long time,10

21 February 2014,Lost potential,Stunning visual effects and sound engineering That alone would justify my vote of 7 However this movie is a disgrace to the efforts of countless people who dedicate their bodies and intellect to make space flight possible I will just point two things that made me feel uncomfortable except from the occasional violations of the laws of physics The character portrayed by Sandra Bullock has obvious psychological issues She is clearly not fit for space flight and she never would have made it in the first place That gives the impression that e g NASA is sending anyone on space without scrutinizing physical and psychological tests Stories don t NEED to have a happy ending It would pay homage to logic and to the people that dedicated their lives for the sake of space exploration if her attempt to reenter the atmosphere and land successfully was in her imagination 7 10,6

27 October 2013,Great but not the greatest!,Maybe its the hype that accompanied it i expected more Gravity turned out to be a great film but not out there with the greatest Here s why The plot is too contrived The links between the various stages of the film too tenuous C mon its implausible for anyone to slip into another satellite and chaperone it back to Earth using a manual written in another language And this is all before there is another satellite used to get there in the first place Anyway lets suspend our disbelief its only a movie The other problem is George Clooney He was outstanding in The Descendants His tentative nature showed his vulnerability there Here he is simply smug even through crisis Implausible again Thankfully his role is smaller than Sandra Bullock Now to the good parts The film shines in its cinematography Full justice to the locale Made Earth look as beautiful as it probably is from outer space Then the musical score Truly outstanding Considering space has no sound full justice Finally the special effects Getting a film done to show zero gravity is tough That seemed to happen effortlessly 3D Well parts seem to need it but for most it wasn t necessary And Sandra Bullock Full credit to her Looks like she s really worked on her role for a long time Her performance is accomplished despite weak dialogues in parts One last thing Sandra Bullock looks is the hottest thing in outer space since Sigourney Weaver in The Alien back in the late 80 s If nothing else go and see the film for her,7

19 October 2013,First half better than second half,Not really a spoiler but I will put a spoiler warning on here just in case First half of the movie is excellent suspenseful and ultra realistic The second half however goes a bit too far and loses its realism and the suspense takes a hit as a result The film is most suspenseful when things are in the realm of possibility but after one too many death defying feats one after the next you begin to realize you are just watching a movie and the suspension of disbelief is destroyed for the more avid sophisticated viewer I know I know I sound like a total film snob but I think directors try to do too much to create suspense and they end up having the adverse effect by going a bit overboard,7

17 November 2013,Amazing and very bad at different times.,I was thoroughly looking forward to this film seeing 10 out of 10 everywhere so was perhaps letting myself in for a fall Let s not get away from it just as so many other space films this was visually stunning probably as mind blowing as Jurassic park at the time These effects give the movie such a believable and realistic feel that you are gripping your feet to the floor and hands to the seats in fear you fly into outer space A movie is not great because of special effects though and this movie is a let down for a number of reasons The main reason is bullock she was not the correct actress for this and does not hold the attention of the audience in gripping scenes If you want the character to fail Something ain t right Bad acting or direction either way she didn t fit the film Clooney on the other hand was great and believable and carried the film Also For such a believable movie visually the storyline needs to be just as believable which it was not So I stopped believing and was only amerced in the action scenes The last 40 min was just an uncomfortable wait for the inevitable Not really caring which way the story line will go In having said all of that it is still a visually stunning and in parts thrilling film It s amazing and very bad at different times overall good,6

28 October 2013,"good movie ,dont be distracted by bad reviews",Gravity the movie is a good science themed logical and fantastic 3d movie those who are writing no sound in space give back money are with low IQ telecommunications travels as electromagnetic radiation and so many satellites serve for telecommunications what people are we not talking on your mobiles AS a avid science fiction film viewer i must say this stands apart the man behind this film has tried to bring all logical consequence into the movie the post film effect was thrilling see the movie and come out of the theater to feel it,10
16 February 2014,The best 3D film yet,Gravity Such a Marmite film you either love it or hate it but either way its hard to not appreciate the beauty of the film from a directional perspective Alfonso Cuaron has made a masterpiece of a film in the way that is a first of its kind Id go as far as to say the best 3d film yet and the start of a different age for films Its epic and beautiful and you really do feel like your their with the characters in space What the film lacks is depth to the story line having just two characters makes the film slightly boring in my view and I do not think bullock can carry a film on her own At times boring and at times magnificent I really don t want it to win the Oscar for best picture but I feel it deserves the award for Director as Alfonso Cuaron Its a good watch and probably better seen on the big screen so you can witness the 3D brilliance http raroe wordpress com,8
8 February 2014,Not even worth a watch at home !,Inspite of being a fan of space sci fi movies had to fast forward scenes to get through the second half No plot no sense in the movie and no reason at all for making this movie Is hard to even review Try and watch a space movies from the 1950s it would be better time spent There is nothing to write home on the acting as there was none needed There seems no plot and the visuals were what any sci fi movies show Had recently seen Apollo 13 and that was the sort of movie one appreciates watching I think its surprising if this move has recovered and made money at the box office,4
25 February 2014,It was like watching the ending of a movie,Title states it all its like watching the ending part of a movie Or a video short I gave it a one Both actors were just going thru the motions The best space movie ever Haha no way in hell Apollo 13 still not all that realistic character wise but technically very realistic and it was a more complete and coherent movie Russians detonated their defense satellites or something like that as it was said so fast and so short It s so very unrealistic and improbable in fact the whole movie was so unrealistic Trajectory s and pin point re entry procedures are ludicrous Pressing buttons by guessing Escape pods out of star wars Ridicules I many not be a astronaut but I am a real life Dr as my hubby is but I have 2 brothers who are pilots one in the Navy and one in USAF on flies the FA 18 the other the F 15E and they laughed at this dumb so called movie This film is an insult to my and everyone s intelligence Not even worth a rental And be respectful of my opinion as I respect everyone s opinion like it or not So be mature enough to respect mine PS To date the best space movie ever was and still is 2001 A Space Odyssey,

12 July 2014,Disappointed. What a bore!,Well that s 90 minutes of my life I ll never get back I agree with everyone else who rated this movie poorly I had high hopes for this movie as I m a big fan of both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney but everything in the movie is so improbable the dialogue so silly and the acting so bad it was like watching two high school students do imitations of Bullock and Clooney Quite a disappointment I don t know why so many people like it The movie should never have been made it s nothing but a ridiculous vanity project for Alfonso Cuaron like handing him a bunch of CGI toys to play with Gravity It really sags under the weight of stupidity,1
27 February 2014,Dull movie,While this movie might have been interesting to see in 3D I can t possibly comprehend why it would deserve such a high score on IMDb I m a very big movie enthusiast who likes blockbusters just as well as the more special movie but this didn t feel like a blockbuster at all to me And special it was most certainly not While I had some problem watching it till the end I always try to do so hoping something good will still follow With this movie however I was left with waiting for more when the end credits were rolling The visuals are absolutely fantastic make no mistake in that But the movie itself is so painstakingly dull and boring it really isn t something I would recommend watching to anybody,3
5 March 2014,"Great looks, story a mess.",Gravity is something for the eye and for the ear as well This movie looks spectacular Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski George Clooney can view our beloved planet from above and what kind of view is that I enjoy the view as well sitting in front of the screen It is amazing The sound sometimes completely gone adds well to the look of Gravity BUT movies are not only about visuals While I love the look and atmosphere of this movie I just cannot accept the story Stone does things I cannot explain She has been trained for this mission alright but HOW can she do what she does I am not going into detail Watch it yourselves and decide whether you believe the story or not I know that it is fiction only but compared to Apollo 13 it surely does lack logic Besides although all these fine visuals and sounds unfold spectacularly I cannot feel any compassion for anything that happens on screen Sandra Bullock does a fine job actually but she never touches me I am not moved by her performance but by the soundtrack that accompanies the more emotional scenes After all Gravity is not in the least a bad movie It is worth being watched But if you are looking for bright scripting and impressive performances this may not be the best choice,7
13 April 2014,the best space movie of 21st century so far,if you like Starship Troopers or Lord of the Ring do not bother to read my review Otherwise Gravity is the best space movie of the 21st century so far for me Very realistic portraying of space with very good play by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney It is a realistic survival story for the stranded in space Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock a scientist on a space shuttle mission It shows how small is humanity and how we can learn from each other If you are genuinely interested what is the space exploration nowadays you will learn a lot and will enjoy the plot Very good storyline with several twists and most importantly without any violence If you like typical American action space sci fi movie do not bother to watch it,10

6 October 2013,You will utterly destroy your chance to really enjoy this movie if you read too many reviews.,My recommendation to you is to stop reading reviews for Gravity except for this one of course I have to admit that I did indeed sneak a look at several of the early reviews for this movie since that is what I typically do before a night out with the wife I have gotten pretty good at reading between the lines of what I find on IMDb and other sites correctly separating the wheat from the chaff My goal of course is to determine which movies are the DVD Movies and which movies are of the Must Be Seen on IMAX variety It did not take long to determine that Gravity was one of those IMAX types So I spent the extra to see the movie with my wife on opening weekend sporting a pair of flashy yellow 3D glasses But wait Houston we have a problem Reading those reviews absolutely spoiled my Gravity movie experience Not because I already knew what was going to happen I had no idea since I did not read any reviews with spoilers in them but because my expectations were already warped by the way I perceived how this highly rated realistic action adventure movie was going to deliver the goods and give me that warm and fuzzy feeling walking out of the theater with my wife at my side anticipating an enjoyable and intellectual discussion about what we just experienced I do believe that we 21st century inhabitants of planet Earth have been so conditioned by our technology and modern conveniences that even our movies must now reflect that same level of overindulgence Not only do we expect and demand eye popping visuals but every Big Budget Hollywood Blockbuster must now contain ultra complex plots with dozens of twists and turns a powerful and ruthless villain a cunning hero and even more inventive anti hero that use Macgyver est techniques to save the day and finally a huge and I mean HUGE surprise ending that no moviegoer could have guessed think 6th Sense and Now You See Me Well at least both my wife and I were expecting that kind of movie when we sat down in the nearly sold out IMAX theater What we ended up watching that is after being contaminated by reading the movie reviews felt more like an episode of Space Survivorman or Man versus Space than a critically acclaimed Blockbuster that we both anticipated So for the next 24 hours after my IMAX experience I replayed every scene every sound and every delectable moment that I could remember while attempting to purge any of my review driven cinematic prejudices As my mind started to clear I suddenly realized what had happened the night before On reflection Gravity delivers a very different type of movie experience than what I have come to expect from Hollywood and what the glowing reviews would typically suggests As impressive as the larger than life visual and sound effects were they only exist to help transport the audience from their normal everyday gravity friendly existence to an alien and truly hostile environment where the lack of gravity is the true adversary What makes this movie an instant cinematic classic is how the tiniest subtle detail is meticulously handled For example the 3D effects are only used discreetly to enhance the moods of particular scenes like the drops of Dr Stone s blood floating across the giant IMAX screen that help captures the ferocity of the moment Admittedly I was originally disillusioned by Gravity s minimalistic plot line But it is now apparent to me that the point of the simplistic storyline was to portray a sheer starkness to Gravity s liner plot Clear your mind of thoughts of shape shifting aliens and NASA hidden agendas and let your eyes and ears soak in every subtle nuance that your senses can take in Allow the convincing story and subversive cinematography to sweep you away from your petty terrestrial existence Experience every moment of pain and frustration as seen through Dr Ryan Stone s blue and brown eyes Feel your heart pump those precious hemoglobins throughout your body while your mind fights to regain it s equilibrium as you spin helplessly between deadly pieces of streaking NASA debris and other space junk Notice how your body tenses up every time the distraught doctor is painfully jerked by her tether as she is slowly towed behind Kowalski s experimental MMU towards the hopeful salvation of a distant oasis in space There is even a tribute to a Pixar classic near the end of the film that gave me a calming sense of satisfaction This is not a movie that will Laserblast you through the final climax Just remember that a great sci fi movie experience can still be delivered without the resourceful use of duct tape or the heroine wearing an exoskeleton or even witnessing the final moments of the bewildered Alien Commander as he screams No that s Impossible,9

7 January 2014,Wow,worst film ever FM jdjvsv dissuasive busby fang GMT BSD nudge glint NM forking nuked fly Bandung Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it Clearly this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it and I do not believe that it would have come together without him However the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey s antics The set design musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical fab,1

4 June 2020,Gravity,Space experience film The first is a new experience The audience is another astronaut such as entering space floating with the characters After breaking the constraints of space and gravity the lens can rotate and drift more freely such as the eyes of an astronaut floating which increases the sense of presence The title of the film is gravity which is actually the most lacking Most of the time the character can t even touch his feet The hints of the mother and the umbilical cord are obvious The story is a bit of a drag It s too strange,7

24 November 2013,Same thing for 90 minutes,I guess people who liked Life of Pi would like this movie Those are the guys who go to watch 3D effects instead of a story Though inspirational to fight until death this movie shows you same actions over and over again for 90 minutes Sandra hitting on satellites over and over again and trying hard to get hold of it to stop from rotating I don t understand why this movie is called the best of the year Don t expect anything from this movie and watch just to look at the space and Earth on a big screen Giving 5 star only for the effects in space which was new Not exactly Some scenes seemed to be copied from Wall E Like use of gas cylinder to get direction,5

25 October 2013,Gravity lacks any gravity,Quite frankly Gravity is a demonstration of what is possible with digital 3D and to stunning affect Unfortunately I could only tolerate about 30 minutes of space junk and bodies flying at me which of course is the only thing Gravity offers I hesitate to call it a film or a movie since it has no interesting plot script or characters I really don t think it is fair to judge the actors one way or the other since the characters and script are specifically designed to provide a couple minute interlude before the next spectacular 3D burst of space detritus I can t imagine how anybody could sit through the 2D version An Oscar nod for special affects absolutely,4
23 October 2013,Great visuals lacking great story,Gravity starts with some great visual experiences especially in 3D and the first half of the film maintains interest and excitement in what is basically a very simple story involving the two main characters The second half of this tale is neither believable interesting nor realistic in any shape or form Veteran astronaut George Clooney appears far too cool during a major catastrophe in his attempt to save the damsel in distress a medical engineer but inexperienced astronaut played by Sandra Bullock Early on local critical reviews rated very highly some referring to a modern day classic of 2001 A Space Odyssey status I don t think so An enjoyable film at 90 minutes in length but very average in its entire context Somewhat of a disappointment after all the early hype and expectations,7

4 December 2013,Closest thing to being there ...,I m an astronomy and space flight buff painfully aware of some of the impossibilities implausibilities used to drive the film and for those flaws can only rate it as an 8 But those complaints aside will I ever be closer to being in orbit No It felt as if I were Surrounded by the infinity of space the earth like a glittering jewel nearby completely alone and unreachable the pleasure of swimming through a spacecraft in microgravity it was overwhelming Clooney is well Clooney capable calming in control bringing humor sanity and perspective to chaos Bullock is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time bringing us into her world with her fears uncertainties terror and past loss that haunts her present I ve seen this three times in 3D first time on an IMAX screen GO see it before it leaves the big screen You will not regret it,8
11 April 2014,Honestly- not worth it,There were numerous problems with this movie One of them is the scientific inaccuracies I won t go into detail but there is a lot But the main one is that it is extremely boring I saw at my home on my 11 inch laptop and let s just say that it wasn t as cool as it would have been in the theaters I do agree though that the special effects are incredible and Alfonso Cuaron did a great job as a director If your into that stuff then go ahead and watch it Otherwise that was it It was just Sandra Bullock in space not knowing how to do sh t and gasping and at times sounding like she was having sex to me at least It was a women empowerment movie someone described it to me which by the way they hated it too I thought i would like it because it won a lot of awards and got some good reviews but I finally saw it and I was like that was awful Everyone who saw it said it wasn t good or it sucked You can check it out for yourself but really isn t worth it,4
23 February 2014,"Space doesn't suck you out, but the over-hype did.",Wish I didn t pay attention to science so I could have enjoyed it more rather then thinking that is impossible or give me a break every 2 minutes And to all the non technically minded who don t care why anything works magic and say it doesn t matter would you accept your favourite romance scene in the rain if it was raining meatballs instead And I am not talking about little nit picking things I m talking the entire plot scene after scene Oh and I guess Bullock can act her way out of a space suit I mean a paper bag But best actress nomination that s Insulting to all the actors tending bars and waiting tables First time I ever thought a 90 minute movie was too long The visuals and space like zero gee are the most realistic ever for a fiction movie but hey why not just watch IMAX space station Giving it a one In your face people who hit ten Really the best ever Really,1
27 October 2013,Unbelievable visuals but not much of a storyline,This movie was riveting in many ways the visuals are truly unbelievable Your stomach churns right along with the title characters and you might find your hands reaching up from the darkness of the theater to grab hold of all those bars and hatches Bullock and Clooney spend a lot of time trying to grab as they spin wildly through space But let s face it the script is really weak If it weren t in 3D and we weren t 200 miles above the Earth there d be absolutely no reason to take the slightest interest in these people Only one question drives the entire film will they or won t they make it And since they re pretty much random people albeit really bad ass pilots and expert grabbers of things flying through space it turns out the only way to produce the slightest spectator interest is to stage the space equivalent of the car chase debris fly by at rip you to bits speeds and tethers snap off at the worst possible moment It makes for a roller coaster evening and for a linear one track impressively visual film with lots of little gotcha s but no real surprises If that s what you re looking for it s a great great film It s very entertaining It ll take your mind off work and make you wonder if a couple of things are scientifically possible If you re wanting a three dimensional fictional universe instead of 3D images see Moon 2009 on netflix,7

1 January 2014,"'Gravity' Pulls You In, Leaves You Stranded",Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky George Clooney While on a routine space mission an unforeseen danger falls upon them Their shuttle is destroyed their crew is dead Completely alone and with limited resources Stone and Kowalsky must try and get back to Earth before it s too late Gravity is quite possibly the best looking film you ll see all year It s possibly the best looking film you ve seen in the last five years too The technical marvels on full display in this film are revolutionary Gravity takes an environment we are all fairly familiar with and shows it to use in a way that has never been done so well before It s at times terrifying exhilarating and then just flat The best elements in the film take place in the first 40 minutes Stone works on the shuttle that will not transfer data back to Houston Kowalsky floats around her and the shuttle telling old stories from his past It s peaceful Houston calls in an abort mission due to Russian satellite debris and that s when everything becomes a whirlwind The shuttle is hit Stone becomes loose in space and it s absolutely horrifying All of this the first 20 minutes is done in one shot There are probably cuts but it is done in a way to mask it from the audience and it is a sight to see Director Alfonso Cuar n has the best cinematography on full display in this sequence and with such a powerful hook the film tries hard in re creating that the rest of its runtime Like Stone s oxygen levels the film begins to fall exceedingly fast as the narrative goes on Gravity tries to express many themes the key one being about isolation As much as we are alone with her the audience never gets to know Stone that well After becoming the sole survivor of the shuttle the film does not let up in throwing any possible hurdle at her to make her survive Because of this there is rarely time to reflect on what makes her a compelling character and there is only so much you can take watching someone float around space if there isn t an emotional pull Even the scenes that play to tug on sentiment do not work because we barely have any idea who we are watching Why should we care if she survives There were many times that tried to break down the wall of her character Learn to let go Kowalsky yells to her a striking image of her in the fetal position of an escape pod is shown etc but in the end Gravity chose action over development which hurt it quite a bit There is no denying that Cuar n s film is a stunning example of today s effects creating a masterful portrait Every shot is flawless from beginning to end Gravity creates a beautiful landscape that much like space itself ends up feeling empty,6
5 May 2014,"A superb masterpiece, that only conscious heads and hearts will understand.",I had to create an IMDb account just to review this particular movie and I will explain why For too long I avoided watching it My friends and most people I know kept bashing on Gravity and making comments on how poor lame slow and overall uninteresting it is So that kept me from even looking up the trailer for it After a couple weeks I felt this urge to watch it just to have a good laugh on how stupid and ridiculous it supposedly is Let me just point out right now that I like mostly all genres of movies but focus mainly on Action War Terror movies for those usually entertain me the most So when I decided to watch this movie I wasn t expecting much just the big laugh that people were telling me I would have By the time it was over I got off the TV sat on my bed laid back in awe and realized this is probably my favorite movie ever Such is the power of watching a beautifully written and directed masterpiece having the lowest expectation being used to fast paced popcorn movies being really in need for a movie like Gravity The movie held all my attention from the very first minute Not for a single moment was I bored for there is tension action emotion and beautiful photography in literally every second of it and it s all so superbly balanced in a way I ve never seen before It s been a very long time since a movie touched and moved me like this one so I wanted to kinda thank that by writing this review and recommending it to anyone who s thinking about watching it It s a complete breath of fresh air from everything I ve watched to date There are people who simply didn t like this movie for a variety of reasons and that is perfectly fine I can understand that But then I see so many people stating this is the worst movie ever made well those people are probably used to only watching Vin Diesel movies and their own favorite movies probably Nolan s Batmans or The Fast Furious series or The Avengers etc I m not saying this one s better than those though I m not comparing anything Those are all great titles and I m a fan of them too But Gravity is like Her WALL E Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Moon you gotta be conscious and open to fully enjoy it,10

4 October 2013,Top 10 of the Decade,I awaited this for quite some time when I reviewed its budget and resource leverage heavy funding on two actors cinematography and footage rights from NASA Disregarding from my pre analysis and onto the movie it was one of the top 10 best of the decade fact The film utilized reasonable advertising and frankly I thought it would be hit or miss when seeing the trailers don t believe what I said about miss it was dead on target gold My reviews rarely go into detail of the movie for the sake of urging you to just go see it since everyone has their own interpretation but it s obvious this film s strengths excel on every wavelength of the spectrum My opinion of its only weaknesses are slightly sub par self dialogue for such a huge breakthrough flick intense spiraling sequences for those who view it in theater and get easily queasy and the obvious twists that unfold like that feeling at the end of Inception to put it into simple terms These weaknesses in no way detract the viewer s interpretation and I guarantee you will love it Lastly I recommend you see in 3D not something I would EVER say as I hate the idea but it puts the scenes into perspective such as the character being inside of the pod and focusing the shot to the outside of the window spend the few extra bucks and do IMAX as well for superior sound This is not a movie to be deteriorated by viewing on your mobile device for sake of saving money this is the James Cameron film of today if you don t see it you re missing out,10

10 October 2013,Who are these people,Essentially an excellent special effects movie Beautiful to watch and 3D did nothing to add to film No character development We don t really know who they are Clooney Bullock Pretty much all dialogue with a helmet on At the end of the movie I felt deflated because I didn t know the characters and who they were Just immediately jump into special effects and a lot of heart pounding but that s it Poster picture for staying on terra firma But there needed to be a build up to the accident and a development of the 2 actors in the film so we know have a vested emotional interest In my theater I became deaf during previews so I may have missed some important dialogue but I doubt it Wait for video,7

6 April 2014,Fantastic!!!! Just Lacking The Story,The Music and Visuals are awesome the way this movie is done is awesome the detail in the way things happen is awesome but the story the story needed more in it the sound Effects and CGI is Awesome which my opinion with out them this would just have been Crap If this movie had more story it would have maybe been one of the top films out of 2013 but anyway i would recommend this movie to anyone that likes space and Space related things Overall i give it 10 10 for visuals and music and sounds but not for story SO GO WATCH IT NOW ON A BIG SCREEN Enjoy,10
20 October 2013,CGI doesn't make up for boring and dragged out sequences of floating and talking in space,Granted I did watch the movie in theatres in the fourth day of release but comparing to the hype I ve been hearing about it there was barely anyone else that came Really the three stars I ve given is for the CGI I have no intention of overrating this movie just because Sandra bullock and or George Clooney is in it like some other critics do I really love space movies I watch 40 minute astrology videos on you tube daily but this movie doesn t deliver the same excitement Yes I am an action lover but I like adventure and sci if as well I have to admit the acting was decent it felt like they were really endangered and it wasn t a movie but somewhat exaggerated and annoying at times because that s all they seem to do There are so many points within the movie I wanted to sleep or strangle myself of frustration because the director doesn t know when to cut out and go to the next scene They literally took a two minute shot of Sandra floating around I was more entertained by peoples reaction in the audience The person beside me had slept through the whole way and whenever the intense scenes were over I would hear loud sighs The only good thing about this movie is that it will bore you to sleep and won t fail,3
24 January 2014,Overrated as hell!,I cant understand why everyone loves this Movie I think its way overrated Mainly because it has NO story at all The Movie starts in Space then an accident happens and Bullock tries to get to earth safely Thats it Even THOR 2 has s better story Althoug i don t like the Movie i have to admit that Sandra Bullock plays really good and the CGI effects are quite impressive I really hope that this movie wins no Oscar because Movies like The Wolf of Walstreet or Hobbit 2 were much better Why do you like or dislike the Gravity Do you think that the 10 Oscar Nominees where justified and should the Movie Win a Oscar,9

26 April 2014,Love Sandra in everything ... ELSE,This was a slow movie I gave it 3 because it did have beautiful cinematography and the weightless shots were very believable It was edging a 4 but the movie had little depth Even the late introduction of back story to try and develop the characters was too little too late I understand that they wanted to convey the feeling and desolation of space And that could be a driving factor for the long periods of nothing This is however a movie and not cosmos or some other educational film The value of film is in the entertainment and the quality of immersion into the experiences of the actors This film only did that about a third of the time,3
15 July 2014,what a gem.,This movie is absolute garbage I would rather be kicked in the testicles repeatedly while eating a turd sandwich then have to suffer through this monstrosity again To clarify I don t mean a sandwich that does not meet my expectations we are talking about a sandwich made of poo I do not understand how anyone could like this movie I think more enjoyment could be found being sodomized and castrated at the same time Oscar worthy Not even close If this movie was never made I truly believe the world would be a better place I wish I could give this movie a negative rating of one million to compensate for the dummies who rated this movie a ten Wow OMG look at the shiny spaceship zoooooom 5 STARS BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME Anyway I m off to make a sandwich,1

27 May 2019,Technically brilliant film,It s a technical marvel appropriately breathtaking in its evocation of space s vastness and the buffeting suffered by the two astronauts in their efforts to anchor themselves to something solid But Cuaron also knows how suspense works,9
4 May 2015,If you know anything about space exploration then don't watch it!,I was unable to sit through the whole movie due to the abundance of technical errors For many years I ve been a vicarious astronaut so I m well versed in what happens on the ISS the shuttle RIP and other missions The movie shows Clooney zipping around the space station on his MMU Manned Maneuvering Unit which would never happen due to safety concerns losing control and injuring yourself or damaging the space station The other flaw that bugged me was showing the astronauts flailing about at the end of the 100 foot long tether At no time has NASA ever used such long tethers for the obvious reason of becoming entangled around exterior protrusions like antennae Since I wasn t able to sit through the entire movie I don t know about other technical inaccuracies but it s a safe bet there are plenty,3
8 June 2015,Great guy,George Clooney stars such a great guy in this extremely intense and almost depressing film George reminds me of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca since both actors leave the women they love in order for them to remain in safe by taking their own risk In the real life people tend to be eager to survive instead of trying to help others The recently wedded George seems like a nice guy in both on screen and off screen I really like his attitude towards the media because he seems like he s honest and open towards his fans However he isn t a good actor since I always know that it s George He always looks the same,6

5 January 2015,Missing the point entirely,Those who have seen this movie and complain about its vapidity and lack of intellectual scope Well is it me or are people today uneducated Or just dim Gravity is a modern mythological journey it s about loss depression spiritual redemption and ultimate rebirth rich with symbolism for those who can actually see and discern It s Phoenix rising from the ashes Ulysses the technology is simply the vehicle to convey the story Here are a few signposts The image of space itself without direction an airless void suited to Dr Stone no coincidence to her unfortunate name Someone in a spiritual wasteland since the death of her only child who when she is at work just drives no particular direction or motivation in a spiritual wasteland Clooney s character would be Mercury the winged messenger facilitator of transcendence sometimes described as Trickster which he literally is in this situation When Dr Stone is about to give in and give up the ghost so to speak he comes to her in a dream and offers the option of returning home Her final journey from Tiangong translates as temple in Mandarin is marked by fire and water She has to save herself from drowning and shed her space skin like the mythical snake before rising to the surface preceded by a little frog swimming before her another nice little touch of mythology the frog symbolizing transformation and rebirth being born in water and living on land The last words of dialogue in the movie from Dr Stone are thank you She repeats this directly to the earth as she is holding on to fistfuls of sand The last image we see of her is one of her rising like a colossus standing on two feet for the first and only time in the movie then taking a few tentative steps like the newborn which she now is,9
17 October 2013,"Some Sci-Fi, Some Action, Some Drama, Average Script, Average Acting = about a 7/10",I like sci fi do you then you may likeee this movie but it s no documentary i e don t expect to learn anything new or cool that you didn t already know or assume Double I E whatever you ve ever hoped to be portrayed in floating in space movies you ve already seen in movies like Apollo 13 and Armageddon I like action do you well this movie has some i e a little like 4 10 worth quantity wise but it s like 8 10 largely due to the nice visuals animation graphics cgi rotoscoping whatever you call it If you like to play video games like me you may like the occasional moments of being suspended in space and wondering which buttons one might push to reorient yourself while avoiding debris at the same time I like drama do you this movie could just barely qualify for drama though it s no save the world Armageddon or Downtown Abbey or whatever you please I did tear up in parts near the end but i do that moreso than most others do generally anyways i presume I tear up too when the trumpets blow during starting television coverage of breakfast at Wimbledon each year if you know what i mean What fails most about this movie is the blatant use of two of the worst and most gratuitously used emotional tugs of all time the same old never ending clich oft used in movies about Ditzy girl gets chased falls down shoe comes off or heel breaks barely makes it out routine and the man needlessly sacrifices self for woman routine I found myself angry at the film about 5 to 10 minutes in when i realized that that was the direction they were taking it with the S Bullock character And then i more or less had to give up completely on the reality aspect and emotionally involved aspects of the film with the purposefully and needlessly gratuitous hangin by a thread throw me a line use of death routine Literally I have no problem with total carnage ala Saving Private Ryan or everyone lives ala The Lord of The Rings but gratuitous use of men stepping on grenades so that some ditz girl can go the distance is bound to turn off much of the population both male and female Like i said in the subject line about a 7 10 IMDb says budget was 100mil i guess i can see that and you can too just by looking at the long list of animators used on this film on IMDb s credit page for this movie I m glad i saw it i wouldn t say it wasn t worth the money as it at least adds to the cannon of sci fi movies i ve seen over the years but i doubt it rises to the level of water cooler talk that a Apollo 13 did nor should it I suppose it s OK in a way to see a director or script writer try to make a minimalist movie that largely revolves around 2 characters as that tactic is seldom used and for that the director could receive some credit however if he d wanted to he could have elongated the introduction and the conclusion just a bit though what he had worked in a get to the point and let the viewers imagination decides what happens next sort of ways I can t really comment too much on the acting since these are your typical typecast big budget actors doing big budget roles and sadly they seemingly took stereotypical scripts that involved the aforesaid helpless girl chivalrous guy routines Don t expect to learn anything but be impressed with the visuals much like you might for a Transformers or really any modern movie that now uses cool unknown effects from the minds of all sorts of background contributing artists Whoever is responsible for some of the scenes and or camera work involving the destructive chaos and debris mayhem what with the dangerous fly bys and rotating camera views deserves some props for viewing angle choreography Last word i almost forgot yeah i partly went to see if because i was wondering if it was at all based on reality which it is obviously not There s no Apollo 13 true to life history to be had here It s all fiction And lastly there were a couple brief shots of S Bullock trying to make her look like the Tomb Raider girl if you know what i mean albeit in an A Space Odyssey fetalesqe position it s just too bad they had to use a B rated KeanuReevesish MatthewMacConaughy type actress to do it I would of rather wished she either puked or crapped her pants at some point or just gone all out hysterical as no doubt many of us would or at least let out some primal scream of victory at the end not the emotional mediocrity we were given Washed up on the beach yes but Lost it is not Oh and also last last word the other reason you may decide to see it is because of the title character Clooney i admit his bearded pieces in recent years have given me more hope that he too may rise from B actor kevin costner like movie qualities even though his bearded characters still had a one dimensional or overly violent quality to them Sadly it seems he has taken a minor step back in this role though due partly to the script script choice as his character is whittled down from main draw marketing to passe narrator repeating for 1 2 an hour what we were all already thinking relax breathe calm down relax calm down breathe relax breathe calm down etc etc,7

12 November 2013,I recommend seeing this in the theatre in 3D,Gravity tells a story about survival in space afer an accident has taken place That story is not very profound nor original in itself but it is executed in a fantastic way enough so for me to recommend seeing the film If you have seen the director Alfonso Cuaron s previous film Children of Men then you might have some idea about how absorbing it can get The intense action is what really makes the film great but there are also some scenes of sheer beauty and calmness that balance the action The acting by Sandra Bullock really helps to become abosrbed in the experience and Geroge Clooney does a fine job as well The music is perhaps the weakest point of the action sequences not bad but not memorable either just a bit bland In certain emotional scenes the composer Steven Price fares very well If you intend on seeing this film I definitely recommend seeing it in a movie theatre in 3D I m not generally a fan of 3D but here it is definitely a positive factor that builds up the immersion instead of creating distraction,8

20 May 2014,Fabulous and quite surprising.....,Didn t get round to watching this movie for ages felt it was over hyped but was more than surprised Its a movie its about space so suspend belief its not a documentary and on first pass you don t get much of a story but wait a minute Its a movie and entertainment it does deliver and mostly Its fun the effects are perfect and largely unbelievable but then this is a Hollywood movie and aren t they all For all its clich d and cheesiness I loved it easy to cast a critical eye and forget This is space sit back and just enjoy the effects and flying debris I doubt this will make my will watch again list it does lack some of the drama of Europa Report or blackness of Prometheus but is well worth a bag of popcorn and and a couple of hours pure entertainment,8
6 October 2013,The best sci-fi for the grown-ups,Almost 24 hours later I still have the post viewing thoughts that the Gravity gave me I have never watch a single movie twice in a single night at the cinema in my life till Gravity came I embraced it first time in 2D and then in 3D Thought that I would like to share some of the amazing things about this movie without spoilers This movie unlike other sci fi this one is specifically for the grown ups The story telling is smooth and fairly easy to understand yet terrifying and breathtaking Start from the beginning the movie managed to have a 20 minute take without a single cut this is one of the most important thing need to be noticed when watching it You will always immersed by the breathtaking views in the space from the first person perspective and the third everything seems so perfect until something went wrong It s all about realism everything is just so REAL Even James Cameron praised the movie saying the best space movie ever made I wonder what s going to be for his Avatar 2 I have no a single clue about how this movie could ever achieved this kind of visual effects Almost EVERYTHING is done through CGI via dedicated computers This movie has to be nominated for the Oscars best visual effects Enough saying about the visual effects the acting that Sandra did really letting the audiences being her and sensing the fear she was in Little did I know I have not seen many movies that a female is the lead role But Sandra is and she did perfectly showing how should be done as a lead character The movie cost 80 mil and spent 4 5 years to make But 80 mil is actually quite good not like other sci fi which spent too much on unnecessary explosions and s t and 4 5 years it is surprisingly long perhaps due to the tech back then could not been done til recently And the director did mentioned that it took them long time to select the characters especially the lead role The movie soundtracks are brilliantly made it is very important to make sure they sound right the reason being is that there is no sound in the space and all you heard just the radio conversations and other sounds transmitted via space suits If you are an ambient music fan you will love more about this movie The movie Sunshine taught me how amazing the scores have to be in order to be enjoyable So the soundtrack are awesome too This movie is absolutely EPIC or awesometacular There is none like it This movie did push the limit of current film techs and made a super fine model for the sci fi filmmakers or even any other types Don t want to stress too much on the movie clich just watch and watch in 3D at all cost Lol that is all,10
3 November 2013,Great,I thought that this movie was great Amazing graphics and storyline Good for those who enjoy a good movie It is a slow moving kind of movie but when the action begins it is intense I did go with my partner and he didn t enjoy it very much so I m guessing its up to the viewer really Ideal for anyone who lives Sandra bullock and George Clooney Those two make a great duo in this movie very glad my partner and I had the spur of the moment to go and watch this movie I wouldn t say great for all ages but it wouldn t hurt bring your child along in my opinion It didn t just drag on wither which was a good thing Always had something happening,8
20 October 2013,What am I not getting here?,I cannot figure out what all the hype is about this movie My husband and I took in a double feature today Gravity being one of them and we both agreed that it left much to be desired Aside from the beautiful visual effects the acting was mundane the writing was insipid the story was predictable It was not edge of my seat in the least I don t mean to insult people who loved the movie or who think it was one of the best made but really And I don t think it s right to be condescending by asking if people who didn t like Gravity were ones who liked Transformers or Avatar never saw Transformers and Avatar was not much better than Gravity In my opinion I don t think Gravity even compares to great movies such as Shawshank Redemption The Green Mile Slumdog Millionaire The Usual Suspects The Departed just to name a few I should have gone with my gut saved 30 and waited for the DVD release,6
4 November 2013,"Amazing cinematography, but a little headache-inducing.",Undoubtedly the film s cinematography is amazing If a film s purpose is to transport its audience to another world then Gravity has wildly succeeded The palpable silence as space debris zoom past the astronauts at bullet speeds leaves viewers gripping their seats in apprehension At the other end of the spectrum the long shots of the sun creeping behind the Earth are nothing short of breathtaking Yet for all the film s brilliance I didn t enjoy it as much as I hoped to The panning and the spinning shots taken from the astronaut s perspective gave me a mild headache during the film I half expected it and when it came I was wary of it escalating and could no longer immerse myself in the film Which is a real waste Because ultimately Gravity succeeds by engulfing its audience in an experience the freedom the beauty the terror of what it feels like to be in space,8

5 November 2013,A must see...worth the money.,I enjoyed this movie and so did my girlfriend I don t know why it received such a high rating I thought that the new Star Trek and Star Trek into darkness we re also excellent movies which deserved higher ratings like this or gravity deserved to be a little lower to maintain a level of fairness and equilibrium We also thought the special effects were great in the 3D format All awesome movies and it comes highly recommended from both of us Rated a little higher than I would She would be closer to 9 I have to say that I would give Sandra a ten and her hair a two In summary This is a great night out and we enjoyed it thoroughly,8

25 October 2013,Sandra Bullock in Space...and that's about it.,It s positives are good suspense and good camera work But that s it This is IN NO WAY comparable to 2001 A Space Odyssey and is certainly not the best film of the year It s Sandra Bullock in space Sandra Bullock does what Sandra Bullock does for Sandra Bullock because Sandra Bullock IS Sandra Bullock I m not trolling I am NOT kidding This film is NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY Go see something worth watching Oh and its 3D SUCKED,1

28 December 2013,Gravity – Alfonso Cuarón (Darrell Ron Tuffs @ aworldoffilm.com),Every other blogger has written about it now its my turn I have to say I really liked Gravity I believe it is my personal favourite film of the year so far Cuaron and his team create a magnificent but also horrifying image of space That on one hand gives space a very tranquil and beautiful feeling It is all the space you could ever need with no humans getting in your way A world that is a million miles away from the crowded morning commute for most people Not only that but it is filled with beautiful scenes of the Earth the Sun and other distant stars all floating around however they choose not needing the laws of gravity to hold them back On the other hand we witness one of the scariest places we could ever imagine to find ourselves filled with such a dark empty coldness that it is unrecognisable to us humans Gravity shows how space can be both of these things at once In a way it is good to have some space from other human beings but too much of it can lead to emptiness and extreme loneliness once you float off on your own I will start with the bad news of which there is very little Ultimately what will happen sometimes with a film such as Gravity is that character and story development will be disregarded in place of technical amazement This did not happen so much with Gravity but I must admit that in some important character moments of the film I found myself more interested in how great the visuals would be when big moments happened rather than whether the characters were in danger There are some smart attempts to introduce personal back stories which I did appreciate However when it really matters I do not think these attempts stick so well That being said the characters are interesting and developed enough to want to go on this journey with them and see it through till the end As far as what I enjoyed about the film the main thing was obviously its photography Never before have I felt like floating off into the air in a cinema screening but the photography work in Gravity is so convincing and free flowing that it is very hard not to feel dizzy at the sight of its imagery There is no up or down no high or low only space and a lot of it One of the background commentaries that I felt while watching Gravity and not a lot of people have brought this up is the way us humans need the earth and are only possible because of it In Gravity the earth is always there shining like a huge ball of hope in an otherwise dead and cold infinity We begin to see how life and evolution would just not be possible without it There would be no heat no food no breathing but as well no control of our own bodies Ironically space could be seen as a freeing from the frustrations of human life when in reality like the films characters floating with no control of even your body is one of the least freeing things we could imagine Gravity is more gripping in its narrative than most critics are giving it credit for There is a human story and some genuine personal emotion but in the end I believe Gravity is more about space itself and how humans can and are reacting with it I also think Gravity has much to say about our animalistic need for the earth and all it provides for us We truly could not live without it not out there in that empty mass of nothingness anyway,7
23 October 2013,"Solid Film, but Sunshine and Moon had more substance as space films",Cinematography and visuals are absolutely stunning They filmed as if you were in space looking out from an astronaut s eyes A lot of views from inside the space station and space ship Bullock and Clooney gave solid performances but I would have preferred more dramatic actors with more depth maybe Michael Fassbender and Jessica Chastain I still believe Sandra is at her best in the Blind Side and not this film I think she is better suited working in scenes where she is interacting with other actors and actresses In this film it is only her on the screen where she is not able to react off another person s emotions or conversation From a story perspective I felt this film was a little rushed and far fetched I like the mystery used and the scenes that left the audience hanging but this film had a number of plot holes Definitely watch this film in theatres to get the full visual experience it deserves But do not expect much from a story development stand point,8

24 February 2014,GRAVITY sucked out all the story,After seeing it being rated an impressive 8 2 on IMDb I decided to watch it in 3D with all my friends And to be honest I was visually blown away as I ve seen nothing like this before But after I picked myself up and moved past that initial awe of awesomeness I found how empty and dull this film actually is The dialogues were so boring and even completely unnecessary at times The acting though was pretty believable but such a poorly written script couldn t provide the support that it required There was so much irritating and pointless background score build up which ended in nothing and the director used Sandra Bullock by making her strip at all the unorthodox places which involves Space and even Underwater But if you can look past the atrocious dialogues and the sorry excuse for a plot I bet the visuals will surprise you Hope you enjoy watching Sandra Bullock scream and gasp for air for 90 minutes with excellent visuals,6
8 March 2018,IMAX screens ONLY,Gravity is video evidence that the quality of any movie shouldn t be based on the size of the screen alone The special effects while visceral and amazing were obviously only meant for a big screen Not only that they also don t hide the minimal plot too well either Since every actor actress who isn t Sandra Bullock and George Clooney got axed really early in the film it s clear to see which side of the bread this movie s toast is buttered on Watch for the breathtaking special effects and try not to be disappointed with the lack of story and dialogue You aren t getting the best of both worlds here Final Score 60 100 Copper Medal,6
10 December 2013,"Down to earth, if u can",Firstly I need to say this is a fantastic movie some of the images in this movie are really beyond my imagination In fact my recent job is a little related to Astronomy but I don t think I could gain any joy from my work I got bored and felt desperately about my life However this movie makes me feel very excited I even started to meditate on some questions which I never thought before What s the meaning of a human being to live on or to die Without gravity we will flow into the endlessly dark and quiet universe forever absolutely loneliness can u imagine that If it happens to me I ll be definitely scared and panic After watching over this movie I am keeping thinking a question We are destined to die our earth is eventually to be destroyed our university will doom to disappear so what s the meaning of to live to have or to enjoy The answer is really terrifying me My friends told me to stop thinking that kinda questions Because we cannot change anything We are so useless when we face the ending of our world Yes I should be down to earth literally but these feelings will haunt around me for a long time,8

24 October 2013,Wrong Stars,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,7
12 April 2014,Annoying woman has unpleasant time in space,This movie had great special effects when seen in 3D at the I Max as I saw it And good special effects was where the entertainment value of this film began and ended This film had all the emotional intellectual and philosophical depth of a wet puddle It was just one long series of impressive special effects with some boring bits involving Sandra Bullock floating around in space to break up the relentless monotony of watching one disaster after another The plot may be succinctly summarized in a single sentence a woman has a rather unpleasant and frightening time in space Be content that if you are capable of reading and understanding that sentence you know all you need to know about Gravity No reason to go and see it I can only put this film s high critical and audience acclaim down to some form of mass hypnosis perhaps involving subliminal images which were doctored into the film,3
27 December 2020,Good visual effects Runtime was bad,I have seen many SciFi movies this was one also good though but It doesn t match my expectations afterall it s an average movie from my side I just rated it 8 because of the visual effects that s all,8

3 February 2014,"A Terrifying, Outer-space Experience.",Gravity will take you on the closest outer space venture you will ever to experience Astronaut Viewers not included I want to start off by stating Gravity is a film made to experience the incredible horrors of outer space It s not made to rival other films in terms of writing character development or storytelling Gravity is a bottled simulation of space And that s a good thing The suspense in Gravity is much different from one of ghosts or zombies films The heart racing suspense is delivered from the constant struggle of an astronaut Bullock trying to survive a devastating wreck And the viewer is taken along for the ride I strongly suggest watching the film at the theater as the large speakers accommodate the sound design soundtrack silent frequencies and not to mention a large screen that pulls you right into perspective The dialogue may seem poor but I believe there to be a contrast of a Smooth Talking Cloney and the breathless peril of Bullock The film is only focused on a single task surviving While many other films used various locations with rich set designs and architecture Gravity keeps the viewer confined to the point of claustrophobia in small spaceships and the darkness of space A suspenseful location which is sure to cause anxiety peril and anguish that is sure to bet the fast running zombie Many people will argue the film is just an hour and a half Special Effects and in this present day Special Effects seem to be a burden for any REAL talent in film making and storytelling Sorry you crazed SFX ranters the film could have not been filmed in space But to those who do enjoy the hard works of SFX Artists you are in for a Beautiful Sight of Planet earth and the terrifying vacuum of space Gravity is a film you must experience for its haunting tale of survival leaves us to understand how small weak and defenseless we really are against the universe,10

7 February 2014,"Little verisimilitude, too much suspension of disbelief required, boring, not intellectually stimulating",I had very high hopes for this film due to reviews from both industry critics and lay people I m sorely disappointed Caveat I saw this film on an airplane The one of the main problems lies in that there is insufficient verisimilitude to compensate for the required suspension of disbelief e g believable characters compensating for poor storyline or vice versa It s not particularly thrilling nor gripping either There are also weakly saccharine aspects to this film which I suppose was meant to be subtle human interest I can t account for the visuals since I saw this film on an airplane I thought the characterisation was very poor I did not feel engaged neither positively nor negatively with either of the two main protagonists Perhaps you need to be from the United States to do so Given the back story of the characters there could be so much more The way that the protagonists back stories impinge upon their characters is very crude there s little subtlety and nuance I did not believe that the characters could be real nor are they interesting and I felt minimal empathy with them The poor characterisation could be compensated by the storyline I did not find it interesting nor trilling nor gripping nor believable Again so much more could have been made of this aspect I did not find the film intellectually stimulating Often I go away from a film thinking about particular aspects that are posed or suggested There s little in this film that did this for me apart from being irritated that I could have been sleeping instead The film is so bland that it s akin to being spoon fed weak saccharine solution Perhaps other reviewers were distracted by the visuals which I did not have the benefit of enjoying to the full As for the reviews from within the industry I can only surmised that there must be some self congratulatory aspect clouding judgment The two main actors are not usually known for this type of film for the actors to perform in a mediocre way against type must have seemed like a great achievement It might well be but that goes to show that the wrong actors were chosen for the roles,4
9 February 2014,"Boring, Boring",I never thought I d rate any movies But these ratings are so distorted I felt I had to The only good thing about seeing this were the visuals they were only about a 4 out of 10 because reality physics are nowhere to be found Script was boring boring really babbling boring Time was shifted to fit the script not what was happening in the movie This is just a Bad movie Ms Bullock has never made a movie I would rate as less than 5 until now You could not pay me to watch this again anyone who thought this was a good movie knows nothing about how things act react in space Out of 11 friends who have seen this movie not 1 has said they liked anything but visuals they were only a little better than average for sci fi type movie Sad,2

23 October 2013,A perfect work of art,Once in a while the Man creates a work of art of such beauty that experiencing it arouses in us very intense unique feelings of appreciation admiration sometimes even awe This was what I felt when I watched Gravity for the first time For the second time in an IMAX theater my feelings grew even stronger because already knowing the plot I had time to admire and savor the finest details of the movie During both showings I came to the same conclusion that beauty is indeed the product of perfect proportions and discipline just like the ancient Greeks believed When talking about Gravity we can elaborate on the outstanding performance of Sandra Bullock the breath taking images of the Earth the stunning 3D effects or the captivating music of Steven Price And still none of these elements alone gives the movie its final shape All its components are perfectly balanced equally important and complementing one another The form of the movie is so disciplined and precise that it brings to my mind a music score in which every bar every note has its place To me Gravity is a perfect manifestation of beauty and watching it is a pure pleasure,10
25 January 2014,an instant classic,when i went to see this for the first time i had low expectations but when i came out from it my mind was blown away i thought about it everyday for months after and will still think about it for years to come My third favorite movie of all time When i went to see this the first time i saw it in imax 3d and a second time in 3d i think you get the best experience from imax 3d but it will still probably be good in other formats One of the the biggest strong of the film i think is they with a very small cast they carry it the film perfectly because your always at the edge of your seat even when its just 2 people talking back and forth So i think its a must see in theaters if you can see it,10
28 November 2013,Weak Script! Stunning Visual Effects....,I saw this film yesterday and found it lacked a lot in the script department Everything was clich throughout the film and it felt as if it was way too short Acting was the good part though but wasn t like something totally out of the world The visual effects was the only thing I enjoyed in it It gave an almost perfect feel of life in space The way they visually illustrated the astronaut suits and the surrounding environment is beyond what you see in films 3D element was the best so far I wouldn t really recommend it to other people but if you are into films with visual effects and stuff then its definitely a film to watch other than that nothing new or special here to watch,6
30 January 2014,A Technical and Thematic Masterpiece,Gravity is a film that I never expected to be so effective at what it tries to achieve and convey The film provides a simple concept astronauts adrift in space that need to persevere and get home yet this simple concept is one of the strongest aspects of the movie as it conveys it s beautiful imagery orchestral soundtrack and excellent acting It beautifully encompasses such themes as mortality nature helplessness perseverance and rebirth Imagery and dialogue convey these themes especially well in that we journey and sympathise with Dr Ryan Stone Sandra Bullock throughout the movie as we witness one horrible event occurring after another anything that can go wrong will go wrong Gravity is also an absolutely beautiful film and can stand tall with special effects cinema legends of the past While not perfectly scientifically accurate the film portrays the concept of space travel in a gorgeous unknown but horrifying visage The soundtrack is perfect for the movies style from the opening scene to the credits orchestral and ambient themes perfectly capture the mood of each scene Gravity is named by many critics as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time and certainly one of the best this year Tarantino names it as one of his favourites of 2013 while Cameron regards it as one of the best space films ever made If you go in with the expectation of a simple premise expect a film that focuses on an individual level and exceptional CGI then you will thoroughly enjoy it It doesn t aspire to be the next generation of film making but it does achieve far more than it intended Minor complaints are pacing and a few science plot holes that don t distract from the main movie but still prevalent when you identify them Know that this film isn t for everyone but if you love Sci fi love CGI done properly and appreciate poignant themes then this film should not be missed 9 10 One of the best Sci Fi films of all time and one of the top of 2013,9

15 January 2014,Daring adventure worth riding!,Great movie One of the top ten space movies of all time Its not the typical good guy shooting bad guy movie But its the adventure in different form The tension between serenity and disaster is what keeps us on the edge of the movie The soundtrack plays a huge role in building and adding the tension and by keeping to minimal it shows is presence even in its absence Space movie is not so easy with zero gravity setting but the fact that he pulled it off is just worth taking a seat and admiring the technical achievement Brings the fragile side and the loneliness side of humanity played well by Sandra and Clooney Visual effects are stellar Can t tell CG from real Well done,9
20 October 2013,I can't believe this movie has received good reviews...,Sure I went in with high expectations based on the things I d heard about this film so perhaps it was never going to measure up But I hated it It was SO boring I kept waiting for the action to ramp up but it never did A few times I found myself yawning and my mind wandering Sandra Bullock played her usual character annoying whiny little wimp which I also found irritating Clooney was good though The great space visuals and the Clooney factor were the only good things about this film Had they been absent I think I would have given it a 1 out of 10 I saw the film in 2D but doubt seeing it in 3D would have increased my rating,4

16 October 2013,Great Sensations,The great success of the film are the sensations Feeling of solitude contemplation fear despair relief anxiety dizziness lack of oxygen lack of sound in space even the feeling of weightlessness you can feel The Director inserts the viewer inside the helmet of astronauts And it really was fantastic It s the kind of film that is well worth it to see the film by sensations The story is nice and could be true although I find it difficult that outcome happen The film deserves the note that gets on IMDb but I hoped for a different outcome more unpredictable Anyway it does not take away the brightness and focus of the Director which was precisely the feelings of people in that situation Everything was very well explored I liked George Clooney as the talkative astronaut than the Sandra as protagonist I do not think she did an interpretation worthy of Oscar Already Clooney was excellent as supporting actor,8
11 April 2020,"Visual effects are great, script is awful",If you re in the mood to see something that is visually stunning this movie is a good pick but the script is so awful in comparison that the second I left the theater I said I would never watch this movie again,4
12 May 2014,Centrifugal Force at work !!!,A masterpiece in terms of direction and techniques used to define space and beyond A major shortfall is that the movie being repetitive and slow paced The action never stops a pulsating thriller maybe not what I d call it Floating in space in a minefield of space debris wish there was more to the movie Script is pretty much the same as all other prior to it with space mission as a theme The saving grace is the wonderful portrayal of space Zero gravity floating debris mammoth scale of spaceships are all woven into the stunning visuals Use of CGI Computer graphics and creating stunning visual effects is what sets this movie apart from the competition A must watch even with a slightly glitched and representative script,6

25 February 2014,Not good,I just watched the movie Gravity its not the kind of movie I would normally watch but I watched it all the way through just on the strength of how many Oscar nominations it has I thought it was a load of rubbish and a waste of 91 minutes of my time When a movie like The Butler doesn t get nominated for any Oscars at all and this movie gets 10 Oscar nominations then in my opinion it doesn t bode well for the future of movies I realise that not all genres are suited to everyone but I can t understand how well this movie rates through all the different age groups It makes me very dubious of IMDb ratings which I had regarded as reliable until now In case I haven t written 10 lines so that this registers I thought it was RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH and more RUBBISH and obviously I wouldn t recommend it to anyone unless they have 91 minutes to waste If it was worthy of ANY Oscar nominations at all Special Effects is about the only one I reckon it would qualify for I also object to being told that realise is spelt with a z In the USA it is they make up their own language also spelt is an English word The dictionary needs updating,1

17 October 2013,Repeal the laws of physics,I m giving it a 5 because I haven t actually seen the movie yet but did someone repeal the laws of physics I read the extended synopsis and it appears that space debris is constantly running about destroying things Any debris from something in a static orbit should be in the same orbit not overtaking something else in the same orbit with enough energy to do damage If something blows up and accelerates it will go to a higher orbit If something blows up and decelerates it will go to a lower orbit In either case it will then be traveling at the same speed and velocity as other things in that orbit If something blows up and enters a different orbital plane of the same diameter it will intersect the other orbital plane twice per orbit but still at the same relative position it won t overtake an object in the first orbital plane Or am I missing something important here,5

7 October 2013,a small step for film-makers...,this movie is a huge step forward and when i say huge i mean huge It basically changes everything we know about film making and stuff it has like 3dimensional computer generated special effects i mean effects and stuff made with computers can you believe it i have no words you need to see it for yourself the history of movie making basically starts all over again year 0 a new beginning the new testament and gravity the herald bringing the message to the people movies no longer need to be good they have to look good amen gravity is a solid 5 6 but considering the rating at the moment let the one star ratings come in people should know what to expect,10

22 December 2013,Gravity Falls Flat,My review of Gravity First off the good visually it is stunning and some of the action sequences are truly jaw dropping especially in 3D The tension is also high particularly at the start as the feces hits the proverbial fan Sadly that is all it has going for it whoever wrote the script needs shooting some of the dialogue is utterly cringeworthy One of my biggest problems with this movie is thus If you are going to have one of the characters spend a long time alone don t have them talk to themselves every few seconds to explain to the viewer how they feel or what s going on a good actor will show their thoughts and emotions through their body language and facial expressions Unfortunately the writers for Gravity consider the actors to inept and the audience too stupid to have to pull this off and I m insulted by that You re also forcefed the obligatory emotional bit near the end that was so painful to watch I wanted to get up and walk out In conclusion I do not recommend this movie without being at least fairly inebriated 5 10 I gave an extra point for Sandra Bullock s legs which are impressive,5
28 October 2013,More of an experience than a film.,This is for short an impressive series of pictures in 3D The plot is nearly non existent It is a 3D experience but not what I came to watch I came to watch a Film You get the constant impression that some things are just there to show off what the graphics department can do They try to make us feel attached to the characters using pointless sad side stories and from my point of vue totally failed There are major flaws in the plot which kills off the aim of the movie They wanted something realistic beautiful and extraordinary and the flaws just make the story unbelievable Next the music It controls and makes a film Here it is fabulous maybe a bit overly dramatic but it does not suit Gravity Space is all about the silence But this music is constantly there and ruins this moments that could have been wonderful if they were silent Over all Grativy is a great movie to watch if you want special effects lovely scenery and a out standing 3D experience But if you want a film with a plot this is not for you,3

18 October 2013,The Humdrum of Gravity,I wasn t very eager to see Gravity Boredom was a guaranteed companion coupled with the annoyance of donning the bulky plastic 3D glasses over my prescription ones did not sweeten the deal Nevertheless the film was playing at a near by theater and I had a free Sunday afternoon to spare I sat through the previews both 3D and flat with deflated enthusiasm and I braced myself for the onset of nausea promised by most of the reviews I read prior I am happy to report that Gravity was a 90 minute nausea free affair for me Since I suffer from frequent bouts of motion sickness and always get dizzy at planetariums I am led to believe the nausea rumors were merely a Hollywood ploy in an attempt to authenticate the outer space experience of the movie As a nausea expert I find it hard to believe that Dr Ryan could have performed her duties while disposed Moreover the lack of perspiration and heavy breathing are counter to my motion sickness experiences With these first few scenes my conviction dimensioned even further I understand that gravity is a movie about outer space and in that respect the cosmic imagery is truly amazing I was transported and thoroughly moved upon the site of George Clooney and Sandara Bullock aimlessly floating with earth in the background centered on the illuminated outlines of the Red Sea and river Nile as George asked Where s home I m from Egypt There were a couple of head jerking moment successfully employing 3D gimmickry Yet had Gravity stayed true to it s original purpose as a movie about space I wouldn t have deplored it as much However the invisible intrusion of Hollywood is blatantly apparent with the film s feeble attempts to create a plot and characters that defy reason and stretch the realms of physical possibility I must say that the best thing about Gravity is it s brevity I believe the film makers would have been better off in keeping the story simple about astronauts doing what astronauts do So if you want to gaze into outer space then by all means see Gravity preferably in imax If you are looking for adventure I believe you d be better off with Prisoners or Captain Philips,3

27 February 2014,Spacey,The main message I got from this film is that there is a lot of debris in orbit that really needs to be considered soon Honestly that was the main message The rest of it was mainly a well done treat for the eyes Yes there was a long time between camera switches which was a visually nice effect each take lasted so there was time for the immersion experience into space which gave the film some some atmosphere For the actual film content I was left feeling that it was a film which included a lot of real world considerations No it wasn t real it just included a lot of the issues that they d experience I wasn t left feeling this is space it was this is a space film with a few doses of realism,5
20 November 2021,Good effects but lousy movie,Basically a vehicle to hear Sandra Bullock pant endlessly Everything was way too obvious and the storyline was extremely weak I watched it a second time just to give it a chance and I don t understand how this b movie wound up being so popular A huge disappointment on every level,2
30 January 2014,Great Movie!! Don't let those nerds get you!!,As I watched this movie from the beginning I knew this was great The script the photography and the direction are quiet awesome There s a lot of pseudo science nerds trying to put this movie down because a pen did not float in zero gravity as it is expected to float Get a life This is one of the best movies of 2013 and for good reasons First the casting I think it s quite good Sandra Bullock and George Clooney could not be better for their roles Second photography is just outstanding I could watch this movie easily four or five times without getting bored because every time you discover something you missed before There s quite a few of good lines and the technical specs are great,9
13 October 2013,Fact and fiction = a better space flick than any other.,Sound doesn t travel in space this movie really captured that truth From radio comms vibrations in suits the audio was fantastic Audio mistakes was a in then out scored music I don t think the space dementia was wrong either however it wasn t explained at any point This would have explained a lot to normal people This movie was a great example of the will to live as well as a leap in the tech to show the physics of living in 0 gravity Personally my biggest complaint is i don t believe the Hubble ISS and the Chinese locations are that close together to hop hop and hop As she can do Sandra B represents a calibrated woman that is just in an unlucky situation constantly George C represents a seasoned astronaut that seems to waste a lot of jet pack fuel that would have eventually came in handy as hell burn out comes to mind with NO pun intended he was fantastic just mulling around I recommend seeing this in 3D i would say IMAX if those Canadians would reduce the price,10
5 February 2014,What a craaaaap movie,Nice visual effects indeed but that s it Sandra Bullock can t play she simply can t Speed 1 2 3 whatever she proved it she s simply bad Clooney looks like he could get a coffee anytime just floating around like all is fine the whole time Where is my Nespresso I was so waiting for that line Anyway seriously Nice Visuals Effects CGI to a really perfect level but the scenario come on God Bless America cause they Can We re stuck in this American Spaceship and we ll use the Russian one and then the Chinese one What the I ve wasted 2 hours of my time,2
26 February 2014,Truly Awful Film,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,1
8 March 2014,Terrible movie.......,This is seriously 90 minutes of my life I cannot get back Clich d terrible story line and development and I have seen better cgi in Toy Story Not what trumps things worse Sandra Bullock s terrible acting or Clooney playing a role of a hero that I acquainted with the same role he played in the Peacemaker and at least that movie had a decent story line This movie seemed to drag on and for those who are smart enough to have any inclination of science this movie has terrible references I would make my vote a 0 but the stars do not go that low,1

11 March 2014,Very Suspenseful,At first during the beginning of the film I was a bit disappointed with the character Ryan for seeming to be so helpless As the film progressed there were some intense moments and truly interesting character development The graphics appeared realistic to a certain extent kind of like what you see on public TV space programs There are excellent moments in the film where the characters show real human emotions and a bit of a surprise at one point I think the ending was excellent but lacking a bit No spoilers here It gives you great pauses to the intensity of the space explorers and scientists and shows a side that is not always seen I was not happy with the sound track as I had to turn the volume way up to get a clear soundtrack Sandra Bullock shows a new side to her acting dimension George Clooney was cast as usual but his character was serious and direct I would recommend the movie,8
16 June 2017,"A visual treat, but with an age old story",This film is a technical extravaganza The visual details of the space the space stations and crafts and certain bits like the water droplet scene the absolute calamity that happens when the wave of debris strikes each time etc are crafted with an eye to detail The background music and the clever use of silence at key sequences throughout the movie is appreciable Sandra Bullock does a fine job as the protagonist especially in the earth communication scene Clooney gives a memorable cameo and his voice stands out as usual The story line is something that lets down this scientific treat It drags quite a lot through the movie with the emotional aspect of Bullock s character not quite reaching the audience I also felt that dubbing sounded too artificial at certain points an example being Ryan s gasps for air Sound mixing is also not perfect Efforts taken by the actors especially Sandra Bullock for the zero gravity scenes should be specially appreciated Overall a film that is worth watching for the technical beauty it is,7

23 October 2013,Civilization's Orbital Decay,Gravity is pulling us down Yes it had several gripping scenes but it also had George Clooney and Sandra Bullock two of my least favorite actors Also I m not a fan of films where the laws of physics are treated like Play Doh Almost 50 years ago a film about space weightlessness and isolation stunned audiences as Gravity seems to today But compare them Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey was a deep profound subtle masterpiece whereas Gravity was dumb thrill ride of no substance 2001 looked forty perhaps 100 years into the future while Gravity reached back eight years at a now dead shuttle program Civilizations do spiral down their populaces trending courser and dumber This is documented in their movies,4

19 January 2022,Neuton,The film around which there is so much hype should be much better than it actually is This movie made a great impression in the theater but it is not suitable for repeat viewing When you watch it on a small TV screen it s incredibly boring because you can t enjoy the amazing visuals and stunning cinematography like you could in the theater Alfonso Cuar n is the director of this film and even though Sandra Bullock only plays in it most of the time she really plays amazing and you always see the fear in her eyes However on a second viewing the film is a bit disappointing because you can t get the amazing experience you got in the theater,9

27 January 2014,No no no no no no,In my opinion if you ve seen the trailer then you ve seen the movie The effects are interesting for about 5 minutes but beyond that there is nothing to this snorefest Maybe I missed something but then again I like a story that has more to it than something that can be written on a post it note in large writing I don t hate this movie but if I had seen some of the more recent user ratings of this movie I would not have wasted my time unfortunately I only saw the high rating and went with that Usually IMDb is reliable but the current rating 8 3 seems crazy high for a movie that is so dire I really would never watch this movie again and can only suggest that if you like to be entertained when you watch a movie then avoid this one,1

12 November 2013,"For an SF buff, Gravity is like homecoming! Both authentic and sensitive.",I have a problem praising the film Gravity I saw the film recently in 3 D on the giant screen of Imax Wadala Mumbai and I was suitably impressed with the detailing the 3 D effects the uncomplicated plot which does not allow your attention to wander and thus enables you to enjoy the wonder of special effects bringing out the spacefaring in weightless conditions I am neither a space scientist nor am I an astronaut So I am not in a position to comment upon the arrangement on the control panels the positioning and the alarms of the various indicators the accuracy of the thresholds of the locks and human endurance etc I remember to have read that American astronauts and the crew of space missions were shown the film and that they expressed satisfaction about the way all such details were depicted in the film I tend to trust the news report as fact and not doubt it as a publicity tactic I accept that the authenticity of every detail should not be an issue since the film is not a documentary the overall representation and a commitment to scientific truth should suffice Moreover even though the film does not introduce or assume any new scientific breakthrough it is set in future and that makes the story Science Fiction and in SF liberties with technical and technological details are permitted I have no problem with that The problem that I have goes beyond these issues I have read a lot of science fiction For example stories by Arthur C Clarke In Fountains of Paradise Clarke describes how the Earth acquires spokes all along the Equator extending into space to a distance where there is no gravitational attraction pulling an object to the Earth He postulates development of a synthetic crystal with tremendous tenacious strength And as an appendix to the novel he presents plans and schemes of such towers already put on paper in great detail by scientists and engineers As a result a story which could have been exotic becomes plausible and comes down into the realm of engineering projects planned and executed by present day mortals In Rendezvous with Rama he observes as a part of the story that not a few spacecraft accidents are the result of the distraction caused by the unstoppable oscillations in weightless conditions of the two orbs human females and therefore female astronauts possess Clarke is always conscious of the laws of physics which provide the frame in which everything in his novels happens and so when the alien spacecraft accelerates towards the Sun without any apparent push someone exclaims There goes Newton s Third Law Such attention to the manifestation of laws of science in day to day life is not an exception in SF I call such SF as engineering fiction because in it the exotic fantastic happenings are subordinated to the universally valid Laws of Physics Such references give an air of familiarity to the tale which then transcends its futuristic setting and attains a sort of contemporary existence albeit in a parallel universe As an avid reader of science fiction I have a second home in that parallel universe I do not have to suspend my logical judgment there all I am required to do is to accept some new contraption or some such technological advancement which is a part of the common existence of the parallel universe What happens in Gravity is commonplace to a resident of that universe and one does not applaud the commonplace It may sound presumptuous but the film began and in a few moments I had the feeling of being at home There it was home and someone had created limelight all around it My heart swelled The film being 3 D I wanted to say Hi to the ones at home Sandra Bullock and George Clooney without disturbing them of course They were busy with some repair work and while Sandra was serious and sombre George was his usual composed self spreading the contagion of composure which is more than confidence into others During the interval and after the film I became aware that I had company And they near unanimously praised the ambiance and the floating tear drop and the upside down image refracted in it and the normal of the place being expressed so evocatively in the never ending slow motion and the bumps and of course the silence Their chatter irritated me this is how my home is you ignorant guys I wanted to exclaim at them I loved George that he was so composed even the gravest danger and I adored Sandra that though she talked to herself a lot all alone for a million miles around you anyone will talk like that but she did not go into hysterics was not even heroic but doggedly went on and on and on and laughed at herself a little when she had difficulty standing up in earthly gravity I liked the film for taking me home Come to think of it I should say I adored the film The problem is these words will be so commonplace if I utter them to anyone at all They all claim to adore it How can I explain to them that my joy is different from their pleasure Got to see Gravity a few more times to notice and then cherish the smaller details the nuances one so takes for granted while at home I just don t want to be in an awestruck crowd gawking at some exotic object,9
14 May 2014,Gravity- A Travel To Space,The idea of travelling and exploring space has always fascinated human mind Gravity which is a effort of 3 years of work is a magnificent experience It takes you so close to the space like never before It has an emotional element to it where Sandra Bullocks is shown fighting her past and overcoming the pain she had developed Gravity is also a story of survival a show of strength which leads to a person overcoming odds to survive Every Moment in the movie is well directed How this tremendous motion picture was shot still remains a big mystery Gravity is a magnificent piece of direction to be enjoyed by anyone who gets fascinated by idea of exploring space Though it may not be termed as a cinematic masterpiece due to its lack of a strong storyline nevertheless its an experience like never before,7
19 January 2014,Watch it. Better yet watch it when you are stoned.,The movie is eye candy The background score grips you deep in Gravity is a movie which isn t very strong when it comes to plot or story However it is one of the best executed movie I have ever watched Yes maybe it is not really physics friendly as pointed out by some of the astronauts but to the ordinary eyes this movie is surreal I have always liked Clooney and this movie wasn t any different He was pretty decent as Matt I was never really Sandra Bullock fan but this movie was probably made for her Brilliant Rating Plot 5 Background score 9 Momentum 8 Effects 8 2D Acting 7 Overall Weed 9,9
2 May 2014,Gravity...Good movie by my book,Visually Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive On every other front the movie falters badly Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals the chinks start showing up Overall the script is very weak Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed smashing everything in its way Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request Kowalski who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while floating around spouting inane dialogs orders Ryan Bullock to disengage from whatever she is repairing Apparently Ryan has six months of training only and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human Apart from this minor bit nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists Who is Kowalski Who are the people who died in their space pods No idea Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock she does it three times the debris presents itself like on cue every single time Then a fire in a space station then running out of Oxygen then something then something It s fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense Also at times I couldn t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them Really Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20 phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can t understand this thing machinery The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy I wont even mention the in your face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is So what works for the movie It s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking But it s not Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either,9
26 October 2013,Perils of Pauline with great space shots,In this movie the best parts are the panoramic views of earth from space and the endless vistas of stars The astronauts go from one danger to another with improbable self rescues and unneeded sacrifices The characters are slightly annoying Sandra Bullock cannot carry the weight of being the only actor on screen for long stretches and conveying the depths of the emotions her character is feeling I was unable to forget that I was watching a movie and get caught up in the story My companion at the movies loved it though and thought it was excellent so your opinion will probably depend on what you look for in a movie,4

7 June 2014,Mostly Silence... Really expect to hear anything in a near vacuum atmosphere?,A good movie about space quite realistic and great monologues Don t expect many actors or dialogs other than self reflection and thinking out loud A Thriller you think you know what shall happen next but are you really sure that Alfonso Quaron isn t playing with widely accepted psychological cause and effect relationships You ll have to see it to find out Great music great photography realistic recreation of 0 gravity environment a near vacuum environment and hyper realistic deep space and earth views from a craft orbiting at near geostationary distance from the Blue Planet and last but not less important in the US Original Sandra Bullock even performs and acts quite well Yes I swear She actually hasn t forgotten how it s done Amazing Isn t it,7
20 January 2014,Gravity,In all candor Gravity has been the most overrated film of 2013 Our movie club cosisting of 21 members gave the movie a rating around 4 out of 10 For us the film is a success in terms of digital technical achievement but there is nary a story and the acting is honestly very limited at best like eating a sandwich without anything in between the slices We discussed the brief film in detail and most of us shook our hands trying to determine why the film has garnered so much attention from the critics in particular Nobody I have spoken with in a period of several weeks since the release of Gravity late last year could understand why the hoopla and praise other than the special effects Sandra Bullock looked uncomfortable in her role and Georgle Clooney was on screen but for a short period of time,
5 February 2014,"Brilliant Visuals, But Not Great Movie",The visual effects of the movie Gravity are absolutely stunning Through 3D and IMAX the breathtaking view of the earth and space is supremely beautiful The reflection from the helmet seems frighteningly real When they are hit by debris everything was crushing apart and Ryan was thrown out alone tumbling The set was enormously impressive Many people women specially don t like this movie because the plot is rather out of date Only two active characters in the movie and most of time it is only Ryan Stone who is playing It doesn t make sense that only two of them outside the spaceship survived whereas the all crew inside died from the debris attack And it is more ridiculous that every time Ryan operates the spacecraft the Russian space station or Chinese space station evil things always happen It seems that dysfunctions of facilities were the only way to spin the movie out The only funny part is Ryan was propelled with a fire extinguisher which reminds me of Wall E which has a similar plot Likely in the Wall E the earth is surrounded by the cloud of the debris which becomes a catastrophe in the movie Gravity When Dennis Tito became the first space tourist in 2001 a new era began Nowadays it seems that everyone even students at middle school can send something into the space which at last will turn into the debris floating about In fact the environment of outer space is easily destroyed in this movie an unintentional explosion of a Russian satellite killed all spacecraft one after another Maybe it is time to consider protecting outer space not just our own immediate environment,5

12 November 2013,Did the movie seriously needed so much acclaim ?,Okay first of all whats with the ranking i am seriouly not able to understand the IMDb ranking system these days and then the GRAVITY Seriously did the movie had so much gravity in it if you remove the 3d effects then its like watching a reboot of 127 hours and whats with Sandra Bullock when will she try to understand that there are othr people in the movie also who need some credit and if she has a fan following so do others have i would rather say play a sci fi space game a trilogy and u will find that better one and about the ranking and reviews i don t think there were so many good titles in 2013 who received so much acclaim while they were not even a bit good to be compared to the word GOOD i think so if GRAVITY should had been placed near a TV video or than a artist films with no sounds then the movie deserves a 8 5 by the way u have to have a great imagination to put yourself in the movie and take a ride with sandra bullock,6
13 November 2013,Not a bad try !!,The movie Gravity is the sad indictment of current film critics such as Claudia Winkleman her BBC co presenter Danny Leigh the hype for this film has been extraordinarily over generous this small engaging space saga tries to show that women can do what is usually depicted by Hollywood as a mans job for the life of me i could not see why fellow astronaut Matt George Clooney was so much in a hurry to cut himself free from his co star become just another piece of floating space junk i found Sandra Bullocks expertise sadly lacking not least by her rather amateur attempt at fixing a malfunctioned circuit board attached to the Hubble Iam sure NASA would not have sent someone into space who had failed miserably to learn the docking unlocking procedures that might be just needed on such a perilous mission that said Bullocks role was well acted but certainly not Oscar material Clooneys role for what it was could have frankly been played by any actor special affects were very good but have been bettered I found there were hints of the Signora Weavers character Ripely in the far superior Alien movie but lets not even go there nonetheless not a bad try but keep your expectations to a minimum 7 out of 10 MJC,7
19 November 2013,Gravity,I know the producers wanted everyone to have the reality of space delivered to them via this film But the overall effect was marred by the type of jump cuts and camera motions apparently to convey the danger of space and the velocity of objects in orbit Fine But after 10 minutes the whole approach became well it wore out its welcome for me and my family It was worth the trip to the theater even though we all ended up with slight headaches from watching the fast impact style of filming The film also did not resolve a basic central question none of these movies take up How is it that the astros aren t FRIED by the level of basic radiation present in absolute gobs at that alt The space suits would have to be like 8000 lbs to properly protect against the rads in orbit or deep space These film s in reality are in the business of convincing thatergoers that they were given a glimpse of life in space Well not exactly,7

29 October 2014,Dr. Ryan Stone-a really special mission specialist?,Me personally I fail to give this movie 10 of 10 votes because of the simple fact that Dr Ryan Stone cannot really be called a specialist Where did she get her Dr from and in which subject medicine yeah right which mission specialist says enemene when she tries to navigate a space capsule which mission specialist has to read an instruction manual for a capsule that she possibly used on a daily basis Even if not THIS capsule most of these capsules are probably quite similar to handle So I really doubt that something like that would give a real expert that much trouble I think Gravity really failed in this regard The other aspects of it are great otherwise it s a great movie with a great story worth to see But I still refuse to call Dr Ryan Stone an expert There s simply no way for me to do that at this point,7
21 August 2015,I expected more,There was a lot of hype and critical praise for this movie however I felt somewhat underwhelmed watching it I bought gravity on blu ray as I hadn t seen it I ve got to agree the visuals were amazing and the facts of being in space were used really effectively The acting was OK but I can t help feeling that George Clooney was underused for the fact there were so few actors My problem with Gravity was the story I felt it was basic and quite boring at times which was a real shame I also felt it was disappointingly short and this mix of boredom basic story and being too short was frustrating This movie is good don t get me wrong The visuals are amazing and it is well worth a watch but after seeing it once I ve ended up selling the blu ray Because for me watching this film once is enough Gravity is a work of art but not a masterpiece,7
7 December 2013,Good up to half way,I am a huge fan of scifi and this movie promised to be something really good Its not everyday you get these two actors together so I was looking forward to seeing it It was excellent up to about half way when they kill off George Cloony Such a pity as from then on you get an overdose of Sandra Bullock that is rather over the top and not credible she needed a second protagonist to maintain a thread of credibility and did not deserve having her part in this movie ruined by this weak ending The jumping off from one base to another was ridiculous and so was the haphazard button pressing or the grand finale if I had seen just the second 50 of the movie by itself I would have given it 3 stars as it is I gave it 5,4
15 February 2014,A solid 5,100 000 000 budget and yet not enough money for a decent script Outside of the action scenes and the amazing yes I give credit where credit is due special effects the movie was quite boring and predictable The acting wasn t bad but didn t blow me away The details seemed authentic i e inside and outside the ships the suits the zero gravity effects of space though admittedly I m no expert But overall it was like watching a guitar virtuoso who can t play a song but can play notes really really fast All technique and no soul I can understand how this movie was nominated for awards SFX art direction sound but I don t see how it could be nominated for best picture Were the movies that came out last year really that bad On a list of space movies this one would be at the bottom for me,5
16 May 2017,Close call,This movie can best be described as a series of close calls Even though the CGI is beautiful the movie gets really repetitive At the end of the movie you will be immune to suspense due to over exposure Some scientific errors makes it less credible and adds to the feeling that the writing i sloppy I give this movie a 5 because of the CGI,5

26 October 2013,127 Hours in space (the watered down version),It was as if the director just wanted to make a space survival movie and so he did But after it was completed it was decided hey why not add in the element of human drama you know for ratings or to make it seem less shallow I guess No a rewrite wasn t necessaryl just sprinkle in a few lines here and there about a baby dying cause what s more dramatic than a baby dying and enjoying the cold dark desolate lonely silence of space hey that sounds pretty bleak amirite and thus a back story was born Oh and what an effective back story it was because at one point I think at least I maybe might have thought possibly that Bulluck s character a horrible or perfect miscast as this actress has no emotional depth just like the movie had no will for survival but then again maybe she just was running out of oxygen and just didn t have the energy only to realize she wanted to live I guess I wonder if flashbacks to life on Earth was considered to make the audience care about her personal life but later shunned because that might distract from how visually stunning this movie was ALl in all tho this wasn t a bad space movie I d place it right below Wall E and right above Starship Troopers,6

27 October 2013,Hyped space drama,Some really good special effects the 3D really works well in this picture But the drama action ratio was awful You never get to feel with the characters in the movie you simply don t care There is some exciting and suspense scenes but they quiet scene in between are too long and slow Mainly cause you just don t care about Sandra background she lost a child blah blah blah its just so damn mainstream typical filling in these drama 3 10 1 for effects 1 for originality its like a submarine movie but in space and 1 for well trained thighs,3
17 January 2014,"Great Movie, Impressive Cinematography",Gravity deserves all the praise it has received It has engaging characters and a fast paced plot not to mention some of the best visuals I ve ever seen Almost every scene in this movie was breath taking from beginning to end The 3D was also impressive I usually dislike 3D movies but Gravity was really enhanced by the 3D effects The acting was top notch as well with Clooney and Bullock giving excellent memorable performances There isn t much dialog but you quickly come to care about their characters I have some minor issues with the plot but overall this was an excellent movie that I would recommend to fans of almost any genre,8
26 June 2021,Impressive,There s a terrific and shocking visual job impacting our Senses which i believe deserved the most of the awards but also a clear and direct appeal to the gravity which leads us to keep Alive in our world for most part of the film AND this is in perfect match with the p nic AND beautyfulnes of the universe shown Can not be indifferent to any of such an enormous prropposal,9

12 February 2014,Seriously NOT THAT GOOD,Everyone kept telling me how I had to see this movie and I finally obeyed regrettably This movie was boring predictable mainstream and annoying I had to press myself to keep watching and that was backed up by my whole family who watched it together with me It has some amazing animations etc etc But seriously the story lacks in so many ways it s sad to see the high points on IMDb This is a simple and plain Hollywood standard 6 10 It is watchable if you are not annoyed by scenarios constantly manufactured for the sake of making the plot more exciting I would never recommend it however,6
5 December 2021,A Feast Of Visual,The formor part of the film is a fascinating Immersive experience The geninus filming method let me experience the same tension with Block The director really created an amazing visual effection by his brillant mind let me feel an excting journey to the space If the last part of the movie could have more detials but not just let the backway to the earth so naive this would be one of the best movies in Sci fi movies history All in all this is a really good movie thanks all the workes in this movie,7
3 September 2021,Good all round film,Visually fantastic flows really well and keeps you drawn in,8
13 May 2021,hold your breath 😆,I love this movie i was so into it i felt like i was suffocating the ending or her birth almost brought me to tears from embryo on an umbilical cord to her first shaky steps was an awesome ride and i was so glad it was Sandra and Clooney who took me on it Coincidentally my cousin i grew up with whom reminded me of Sandra referred me to the movie she passed away from an aneurysm new years 2019 and now the movie has special meaning for me,10
21 June 2021,Realistic movie with breathtaking visual effects,Gravity stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in a heart pounding thriller that pulls you into the infinite and unforgiving realm of deep space Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky Clooney But on a seemingly routine spacewalk disaster strikes The shuttle is destroyed leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue As fear turns to panic every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space For all its stunning exteriors it s really concerned with emotional interiors and it goes about exploring them with simplicity and directness letting the actors s faces and voices carry the burden of meaning It s a film about what happens to the psyche as well as the body in the aftermath of catastrophe To be astonished frightened and entertained all at the same time that s the power of Alfonso Cuaron s masterful film A mindful and meticulous meditation on mortality tragedy and the human spirit Gravity is driven by both stunning cinematography and Bullock s artful complex performance,9
6 February 2014,Did I watch the same movie as everybody else?,I am really confused This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen And there are very few movies I hate Why does everyone every one else love this movie Horrible script predictable plot and very untrue with the science It missed every piece to be even a decent movie one of the pieces making me most annoyed was absolutely no character development I think the point I decided I officially hated the movie was when they were tethered together and George Clooney for some reason was being pulled away even though there was no gravity and no inertia to keep him from being pulled away The movie did a great job of following science when it worked for their plot and just being completely void of it when it made what they thought was a more exciting story line Come on if you are going to make scifi movie be true to the science part of it I will say I do love Sandra Bullock even after this unfortunate movie,1
19 January 2022,"Interesting, but not perfect",I didn t really like the movie because in some places he was naive and implausible and terribly predictable Every time it was already clear what Sandra Bullock would do the next moment But some moments were amused it s necessary to come up with it an American cosmonaut in a Russian space suit on a Chinese shuttle nevertheless flew to Earth But I also had to be sad there were many moments when I even cried especially for those who have children I think Involuntarily you begin to empathize with the main character,8

16 April 2014,NIce graphics shame about the characters,I had no real preconceptions when i came to watch the film and ended up watching more by accident than design I watch a lot of Science Fiction films for a variety of reasons including future speculations and how technology effects our lives either for good or bad often the latter Sometimes for fun or something to watch This film was mostly this something to watch and marvel at if you will Films have characters we relate to hopefully and go on the journey of the story etc with them The film disappointed because the characters where so thinly portrayed The central character played by Bullock was kind of abstract and unmoving She was out to prove something to her self and ultimately some resolution to past tragedies was all i got from the film I watched it till the end and though exciting and visually impressive it didn t impress me neither did her story,3

17 April 2014,Angular Momentum (2D viewer),I feel I am being generous when I give this movie 3 10 and given the average rating it seems most would disagree Do allow me to explain I am perfectly fine with entertainment taking a creative license however you cannot tax my intelligence by giving us absurd realities while portraying our existing one If it s the Matrix and the rules can be bent sure go ahead and fly into an agent and destroy him Neo and I ll go ooohhh but if you don t bring any new rules in you better play by the ones in place or release the movie as a comedy and I ll sit quietly Gravity is pure eye candy and it only makes sense if you re watching it in 3D There is no story to speak of and if you are going to send a medical officer to work on the hubble space telescope well you re telling us not to take you seriously in the first place just buckle up and enjoy the ride Okay let s go I am pumped but the ride isn t that exciting In fact the ride in 2D is much much less entertaining than almost any space documentary that explains the universe There is so much awe and wonder out there and given how the laws of gravity are responsible for everything that exists here we have it misrepresented to have no meaning at all just that in zero gravity you will float around that s it Not your hair of course or at least not sandra bullock s hair but everything else Fine let s continue oh no it s done That s it She has to find her way back and she will just jump from space station to space station figuring everything that s need out when she gets there They try to imply how big space is how important gravity is yet if you re watching in full HD on a fair sized 2D screen well it s a poor showing without much else Let me explain how big space is Voyager 1 launched in 1977 and travelling faster than any human made object is on the outskirts of our solar system on the verge of entering interstellar space It is travelling at 17km s If you can somehow manage to travel at the speed of light starting right now you will catch it in 17 hours and a few mins If you continue to travel at the speed of light you will come across our closest neighbourhood galaxy Andromeda in 2 million years That s 2 million years at the speed of light Andromeda is one of over 400 billion galaxies that we can observe today That is how big space is Because of gravity Andromeda will merge with our galaxy the Milky Way in 5 billion years and the super massive black holes at the center of the galaxies will merge That is how powerful gravity is The reality of our universe is more glorious than we can imagine more wondrous than any poet can pen and more complex than our collective knowledge today Why dumb it down We can appreciate these things on their own without an American high 5 style story You can do so much to enhance these wonders with 3D and you give us this rubbish Or hey maybe I should have just seen it in 3D,3

20 January 2014,Really? Waste of time..,I cannot believe this movie is so highly touted It never grabbed me Nothing flat line So totally phony Especially the ending I don t vote very often but just had too Waste of time Should pay me to watch this for my time A pointless movie What was the point A movie is supposed to what Put you in their shoes Make you feel like it is you in the situation I fell asleep and had to make myself stay awake for this To place a review on here I have come up with ten lines of text Why How many times can I say I am disappointed in this film Bad acting Looked like fun to be floating around At one point it looked like Sandra Bullock was actually an animated character like in those video games everyone loves Oh that s it this movie plays to all those people The video gamers Again really bad movie I d say a B movie Sad but true,1
13 December 2013,A better movie if seen in theaters.,As much as I would like to give this film a higher score I just couldn t I felt like Gravity was best seen through the big screen Don t get me wrong the movie was good and all but to truly enjoy this film you would need to be totally immersed and the a small or medium TV just wont cut it If you have a large TV screen at home and an elaborate sound system then this movie is totally going to blow you away Aside from that Gravty was a great time Probably my favorite Sandra Bullock role since Speed The story was simple but everything else makes up for it and I especially enjoyed the musical score,7
17 February 2014,"Doesn't soar high, just plummets down.",I picked the film to watch because I like Sci fi films and the reviews were saying great things about the film It might just be me who thinks this but I found the film very boring to watch The film started off fine It seemed like a normal beginning which would then pan out into an interesting storyline It just felt like that there was no storyline It was a film which was total chaos with flying debris smashing into various space stations and killing loads of people After half an hour I already guessed how it would end I guessed right and just had to sit and wait till the end There were some good things in the film For example the camera work and the CGI was all fantastic Also the sets they used were all great but what else do you expect for that kind of film with a massive budget I think I was just let down after reading raving reviews about the film Remember that this is my opinion What you think and what I think can be very different from each other,3
30 December 2013,Effects instead of content,Gravity The films title was well chosen by the director Alfonso Cuar n although gravity itself is not the main theme throughout the storyline It s of course more about the non attendance of gravity and how it is shown in a cinematographic way But in the end that is the only aspect for whom Gravity can be seen as ground breaking If you are going to watch gravity because you are excited about an innovative storyline with great dialogues monologues and a beautiful screen along the way you ll be disappointed It s going to get much less than that There is not even one conversation that holds you in tension or feels profound in any way Therefore the acting is OK But as far as George Clooney s character is concerned it s just ridiculous and completely out of place The audience gets stupid gags small talk and only few moments where the seriousness of the situation and the fear of death comes to light As a result of partly emotionless acting flat character sketches and in my opinion an average screenplay the film deserves critical consideration On the other hand the camera work is astounding The weightlessness feels almost real from every perspective you get That is the one aspect that can be seen as superb Of course the effects and visualizations of space were great too but let s face it that s not an achievement that can justify a rating like that All in all I think it can be said that Gravity can be seen as a great movie for everyone who does not expect more from an innovative idea For everyone who does not want extraordinary thought provoking dialogues For everyone who sees the cinema as a place where he can get great effects and a little bit excitement in his daily routine In my opinion it should be more,5
23 February 2014,Brilliant but not very credible,The plot assumes that gravity does not apply in deep space which is fair unless you find yourself in the proximity of a planet However the movie scene is very close to Earth surface Hubble Telescope being low orbit Given that Earth radius is around 6000km at 600km altitude you should feel around 90 of the gravity on Earth The movie completely oversees that Actually the only way to be gravity free at this altitude is to be inside or hooked onto a Geo stationary orbiting unit like a satellite Withstanding that you are subject to Earth gravity Floating around chaotically is not an option you will be sucked by Earth s gravity field On the other hand if you are on a stationary orbit you will revolve on a fixed position relatively to Earth so you cannot see Earth spinning like this movie magnificently shows I find it difficult to make terms with laws of physics being completely skewed I guess that attention to detail could have been a bit better,5

30 January 2014,Brave Man saves Whiny Woman,It takes no courage to survive more to save someone else The real hero of this picture is the male astronaut The female panted and whined her way through it all In terms of sexual politics would have been more interesting if the sexes had been reversed Since film was written by the director I now think I know his view of women By the end of the film I wanted to brain the female character and tell her to shape up Some minor points of disbelief I don t know why she stripped to her underwear in what had to be an unused and thus cold spacecraft Russian except to give the audience some skin I don t know why trained astronauts would leave so much junk floating around It was amazing that all the space stations were beside each other I don t know why they didn t salvage more from the destroyed abandoned vehicles before moving onto the next AND I don t think NASA would have sent someone so psychologically damaged into space Scenery awesome and I love space science fiction so still gets a positive score,7
3 June 2014,"It's fantasy, folks, not a documentary",I am also a nerd and I agree with all the nit picky complaints about irrational features or unscientific details but they are not enough to ruin the movie if you recall WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE Please allow me to explain Would you criticize a Mazda Miata because you can t bring a set of table and chairs home in it No it makes a lousy pickup but it was never intended to be a pickup truck Judge the movie for what it was INTENDED to be a fictional account not a spaceflight documentary Would you slam a western movie where the sheriff is at full gallop chasing the outlaws yet manages to shoot them with a handgun from the back of his speeding horse Would anyone over the age of 9 years believe that Why don t we pick of the Harry Potter movies or Lord of the Rings They are full of mind stretching details I could cut them enough slack on all that if the movie had a real plot if the screenplay had any believable characters Unfortunately it has neither However the most annoying feature of all is the thunderous music soundtrack Cuaron begins the movie describing the total silence of space except for radio talk Floating loose from your ship in dead silence would seem more eerie and frightening But movies need music and this director and composer have resorted to a cheap trick You can build movie suspense by hammering the audience with loud dlscordant music but then it is the noise that makes us tense and uncomfortable not the action I actually had to turn it down during the loudest scenes I did not want to injure my 2 dogs hearing I did get one smile though When Bullock finally made it into the Soyuz capsule and floated weightlessly while removing her space suit it reminded me of Barbarella that AWFUL sci fi spoof from the sixties This may be the worst sci fi spoof ever made and it doesn t even try for scientific veracity but the opening scene is justifiably famous Jane Fonda opens the movie floating weightlessly and removing each part of her space suit just like Bullock revealing her rather amazing 30 year old birthday suit No I am not asking Sandra Bullock to do the same Overall a thin story that is being used to show off their skills at cinematography and computer generated action Admittedly excellent but the movie is all hat and no cattle,4
7 October 2013,What kind of watch,Great movie Does anyone know what the stopwatch that Sandra used to time the return of the space trash was My wife finds movies with lots of space very scary like being in the middle of the ocean or even simply being sense deprived Her hands were sweeting the whole time If I was thinking about going to space I would no longer be thinking about it Oh as far as the unrealistic part of the movie that would be US still having space shuttles Sandra looked great as usual well maybe not the hair and Clooney you are the best at talking about yourself Sandra s barking was great I know she got it right on the first try you god you But really can someone help me find out what that watch that she wore was The big stopwatch I love watches,
24 November 2013,Pulling 'Gravity' back down to earth...,This film is clearly visually stunning from the first few seconds however it falls short in plot Since there is only a brief mention of Ryan Stone s past we feel little connection towards the character George Clooney displays a lack of emotion in his portrayal of Matt Kowalski destroying any human relatability I can t believe it has been rated so highly In my opinion every film should have a strong well thought out narrative with characters that are understandable emotionally I think with their big budget they went overboard on visual effects and forgot the key elements of a film The effects were outstanding but this novelty shortly wore off Utterly disappointing,5
22 October 2013,Watchable but forgettable,This movie is pointless to watch in 2D but epic in 3D Plus point about this movie is it s visual effects The movie s special effects are magnificent and realistic This is like a space version of Cirque Du Soleil Either you will find this movie extraordinary or boring after sometime it depends on your personal taste The plot is weak with lots of clich s The characters aren t that well developed All the characters are almost one dimensional You will enjoy the movie while watching but after one week you will hardly remember anything about it at least I did If you are a Sandra Bullock fan you will enjoy more than others I will recommend one should watch it once in 3D on the biggest screen available,

16 November 2013,"acting was pretty poor, story was alright, directing was great",Ill begin with the good its one of the most visually beautiful films I ve seen all year however this cannot make up for the fact that the acting was average at best and I felt a complete lack of empathy due to Bullock playing a character who was completely unrelatable The story was lazy at times and I felt the director was trying to build up false sense of suspense only to lead to cheap jumpscares Although it was to be expected i found the trailer very misleading I came into the film expecting to see quite a lot more about the struggles she found herself in BUT she spent almost a third of the film doing nothing and a great length of time with very feint audio and watching a POV of space although this does build suspense too much of it made me lose interest and did not really make great cinema To summarize Visuals fantastic Directing good Plot nothing special Acting meh 6 10,6

25 November 2013,Short-sighted,The movie does nothing to get it s audience to get to know the characters even Sandra Bullock s character None of the characters were ever introduced If you do not know who the actors were Conley and Bullock you would not feel attached to them at all The visual effects were good and there was a semi solid use of physics concepts but it missed out on so much The sun is not yellow we see it as yellow because of the atmosphere which in space is nonexistent The movie should have had an introduction to it If you watch this film on the big theater with 3D glasses you might like it but as soon as you buy it to own it will loose 70 of it s value as the movie is mostly a visual spectacle no plot or story to be praised for,5
18 January 2014,Worst space movie ever,Actors are cool but story is pretty bad Something I can t understand is how the girl didn t get hurt at the end She didn t even get a headache People is rating the actors instead of the whole movie Effects are nothing special even in sitcoms such as the big bang theory effects like these are seen Pretty bad Actors are cool but story is pretty bad Something I can t understand is how the girl didn t get hurt at the end She didn t even get a headache People is rating the actors instead of the whole movie Effects are nothing special even in sitcoms such as the big bang theory effects like these are seen Pretty bad,4
28 December 2013,Fine space movie,Ignore the reviews that give Gravity 1 star and ignore the ones who give it 10 It s a damn good ride for 90 minutes Anyone who thinks a sci fi film has to be believable or closer to reality shouldn t be reviewing it It s not the greatest film ever made but if you give in to the fantasy you ll be on the edge of your seat A lot If you go in as a film critic you ll come out disappointed Sandra Bullock went up in my estimation after this and although I m not a fan of CGI the visual experience is immense I reckon CGI should be a last resort when you can t use other methods not used for everything for the duration like revenge of the sith Apollo 13 was a better story given it was real but it got dull and you can t say that about Gravity,7
3 January 2014,"""Emotion"" is the keyword",I am starting this review from one fact I suffer from vertigo and this movie kept me in a state of tension for three quarters of the whole time The movie is overall visually stunning The camera creates the depth needed for the outer space scenes and at times focuses on small details which become crucial to the development of the action This visual device helped to create a sense of inevitability you actually saw things coming The main plot is not particularly complex and the dialogs aren t either but there are some narrative devices that suggest more layers of interpretation The two characters were convincing enough Dr Stone Bullock more than Lt Kowalski I saw the whole movie not only as a thrilling story but also as the tale of an emotional evolution and growth One of the best films I ve seen in this late period it still lacks something that would make it a true classic,7

11 November 2013,A roller-coaster ride in the final frontier,Like most movies that revolve around only a handful of characters with little or no extra casts that i ve seen i expected this to be a film that focused primarily on the character s behavorial patterns and how it changes throughout the film This film definitely has that but only as a minor driving force to push the story forward This is one film in my opininon that is one perfect ride experience The film doesn t even get into the tecnicalities of the tasks assigned to astronauts but what it would be like if you were in space and obviously something went wrong This is a movie about isolation and survival with an accompanying soundtrack that only makes the experience so much more worth it,8
20 February 2014,"Visually good, but not more than that",This is a movie that you watch for the audiovisuals The makers of this movie have done a good job regarding the visuals The soundtrack is also useful But that are the only things that are good There is absolutely no story to tell The acting is average and sometimes even annoying The movie is too short too have a decent story The movie tries to be realistic but fails too depict this to the viewer It s a shame because this movie could be so much better if the makers had took some time to improve the above points I recommend this movie only to the people that want to enjoy the good visuals For an intelligent science fiction you should be searching elsewhere,5
10 February 2014,Yawn,I did wake up several times during this debacle but the first few minutes completely destroyed any reason to continue watching Mission control Move there s a load of debris about to hit you Woman Oh no just a minute I know better I just want to finish my cross stitch End of story I do agree with the one star reviewers but a couple of items impressively floated out of the screen and my wife and children enjoyed it so I generously give it three I am required to put 10 lines of text so I will refer to probably my favourite film of all time 2001 which is still a masterpiece As I recall the women in that were either wives or Space Shuttle Stewardesses not incapable token female astronauts,3
23 February 2014,Not quite as good as I thought it would be.,When I finishing watching the movie today the first word out of my mouth was BORING I think this movie should have started w both DR Ryan Mat at their homes letting the audience get to know them by showing Ryan Mat s family life getting ready for the flight to outer space then going to space I was surprised at the ending that no one met the shuttle I loved the great photography of outer space You really captured the reality of outer space making us feel like we were right there especially seeing it in 3d as my friends I did To some it up there could have been more of a story not leaving the audience with 2 3 of a movie,6

10 March 2014,"Beautiful images, but...",The special effects and images are stunning but I found that the movie was lacking substance the story was somewhat ordinary for what I was expecting out of this kind of movie Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were obviously hired to sell this movie because their role could have been played by just about anyone They add nothing but their names to the acting I suggest to potential viewers to see it in 3D where you will get the full effect of the stunning pictures and action but I would not waste the money in purchasing the recently released DVD unfortunately Didier,6

13 September 2022,Hollywood in space... but not in a good way.,Imagine you put George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in space They re not pretending to be astronauts they re just themselves In space Now imagine that they say things like a couple of writers who want to write bar banter Here it is Gravity Don t worry about hard sci fi stuff It s called Gravity That means it s about hard sci fi stuff There are ways to make this work There are ways this could have been amazing honestly but when you hang at the bar with your writing buddies and listen to bad ideas from producers all day long you don t make Das Boot You make this In truth Alfonso Cuar n wrote it with his son That s a factor Poorly researched The script is garbage and the film is poorly executed Writing a basic two character script shouldn t be difficult but it is when you write like this CG is amazing Cuar n has done some good work Children of Men Roma This ain t it So watch this then check out Adrift which gets lower ratings but is better mostly because of the writing acting and directing,4
13 July 2019,Awesome movie! A must see.,It illustrates why I will never go there Great movie,9
22 August 2020,Watching on BBC one,Well it s just finished It s ok not my first choice to watch Sandra bullock was very good but I can t stand George Clooney Thank god he wasn t in it too long But overall surprised me in a good way,6
31 July 2018,One of my favorites,All the people saying wow this is so unrealistic well yes it maybe isn t the most realistic movie out there but how many films are realistic I personally love this film and highly recommend it to anyone who loves thrilling action The music is super intense and the acting is also great,9
