10 June 2002,Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

14 May 2007,"In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....","Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.

Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.

I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.

But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.

I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.

7 April 2006,Pure Charm,"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.

Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film.

The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.",10
19 May 2016,Dropping My Keys,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.

I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fianc√© at his side, clean-cut and happy.

Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""

And the water-works just started to flow.

I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""

Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.

I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.

When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.

The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.

I can't help it.",9
8 April 2002,A beautiful fable for now and the future,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.

I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.

The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.

I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.

The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!",10
22 December 2012,The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...,"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.

Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made.

Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it.",10
15 December 2007,Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!",10
31 May 2004,Purity and innocence retained,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.

22 December 2015,a box of chocolate,"more than adaptation , it is a visual parable. about vulnerability and its magnificent potential. about innocence and its importance to discover the real essence of life. about love, family, fight and courage. a film like a revolution. because it propose the best manner to be yourself and to not be a victim walking on that way. more than story of Forrest Gump, it is the story of people around him. a film like a Rubick cube - many faces, each for complete right color. and a image who remains its mark - the box of chocolate, the run, the ping - pong match. it seems be the best role of Tom Hanks. in fact, it is definition of a new period after the Cold War. a pledge. about the small things.

1 December 2007,Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.

This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)

Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing.

Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.

Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.

See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made.",10

25 December 2020,Encapsulating...,"... all that is, all that was and all that will ever be, through the life experiences of the titular character performed to perfection by Tom Hanks whose generous performance leaves us humbled and in awe of what we can achieve, how we can achieve it and why we would want that achievement in the first instance. A piece of cinematic storytelling that will perpetually resonate no matter who or what you are, where you are going or who you are going with - timeless.

22 January 2023,"Thirty years on, and it's still as wonderful.","A very eventful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.

Tom Hanks, we all know just how good an actor he is, but there is something about his performances here that's extra special, he is simply outstanding. He's given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.

Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.

It's funny, it's moving, it's wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It's a long film, but it's one that simply flies by.

The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you'll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it's a terrific soundtrack.

I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn't appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it's a captivating watch.

Keep on running Forest.

1 April 2000,One of the best films of the 90's,"Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas.

And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves. Well done, well acted, and well directed to pythagorean procision. A++

12 February 2021,Mama said ...,"Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.

If you can dig all that and go with the flow, than the chocolate box this opens up for you, will taste quite delicious. It had been quite a while since I saw this the first time, but it still worked its charme to say the least. Great movie, great actors - you have to be in the right mind set and mood though. And be able to forgive certain things ...",10
13 February 2010,The Hand Of An Unseen Providence,"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.

It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.

Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.

There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different.

The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clich√©s.

Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.

It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.

To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.

In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.

If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.""",10
14 February 2005,why such a low rating???,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

20 June 2005,The zen of Forrest Gump.,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",10
25 May 2005,Life's Lessons in one Movie...,"When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...

18 December 2003,Neither as good or as bad...,"People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea. But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that. The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.

But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here. Sinise was excellent as well. Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.

If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie. But then, she fell asleep during Casablanca, so....",7

9 September 2014,"After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years.",10
22 December 2006,Tom Hanks' best performance,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.

Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.

Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.

All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful.

18 January 2020,Impressive film,"It's a feel good film, that's not a bad thing. In this modern era of sequels and reboots, films like Forrest Gump offer an escape. I still believe Pulp Fiction was the better film for the best picture Oscar, but this is still an incredible film. Touching and heartwarming storyline leads our central character through some important moments in history. One of a kind film, that was not followed by a sequel. Tom Hanks is the foundation here, but is surrounded by a great support cast.

11 May 2016,"A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.

Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.

Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.

Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.

On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended.",
1 November 2003,A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture ¬ñ any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers),"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

1 November 2019,"I liked it, but I did not love it","I get why so many people gush over this movie, I really do. I have watched it quite a few times myself. It is good to kill a few hours and be entertained. It ain't great though. The overwhelming emotion I feel for Forrest is pity, as he is strung along and used by the object of his affections. This is a decent movie, perhaps one of the best from Mr. Hanks, but I do not feel it deserves as much hype as it gets.

4 November 2014,American History Through The Eyes Of A Simpleton,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), eludes him.

This film is fun, funny and touching, if not a little bit sad. If a school wanted to (and no doubt some have), it would be an interesting way to teach the second half of the 20th century. Elvis, Wallace, the Kennedys and more.

This is probably the film that ""made"" Tom Hanks. Although he was already big in the 1980s with ""Big"" (no pun intended), this was probably the turning point where he went from comedy to serious actor (well, somewhat serious). And it probably remains his most-watched movie of all time (well, besides maybe ""Sleepless in Seattle"").

15 November 2013,Tale worthy of Frank Capra,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. It's his journey through American history. His childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. His journey is heavily influenced by his mama (Sally Field), Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), and Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson).

Director Robert Zemeckis has added another chapter to the American mythos. It is a magical tale where the good guys win out. That you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. That a good heart will enlighten all it touches. It is a tale worthy of Frank Capra.

If I could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to Gump's journey. For example, he's given a chance to comment on the Vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike. I would have like to hear what he had to say. But that might have been asking too much. More than anything, Gump is not controversial.",8
3 October 2020,American history book + fairy tale for adults,"Of course I heard about this famous 'Run, Forrest, run!', and how Forrest Gump is the best of Hanks' acting career. However, I'm telling you this was not my kind of movie according to basic information provided. It has one narrative which happens to be biographical. My first thought is that 'Forrest Gump' will be another linear story talking about one character throughout the whole movie. Linear story lacks dynamic and bores me. Second, it is very AMERICAN, the stuff only hollywood clique will enjoy. I keep myself away from the literatures that emphasize patriotism too much.

However, this movie does not bore me a bit for 150 minutes. Even though Gump narrates his whole life from the childhood to fatherhood, it feels more segmented. By cutting each chunk of life story and getting back to Gump in the bus station back and forth, it feels like the movie is giving the audience break after each session. I get to refresh and sum up at every scene of Gump at the bus stop. Also, supporting characters are unique and powerful, making the movie more dynamic. Rather than having many insignificant supporting characters, the director chooses to select and concentrate on three. Then, the audience can hear about the full story of Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan, sharing the story with Gump.

Even though there were many American historical moments, they were just necessary to develop along with Gump's story. AND it was funny to see Presidents and Elvis alive again with visual effects. Life lessons given to the audience are not just for Americans. Many countries go through conflict, turmoil, and destruction, and 'Forrest Gump' concentrates on what choice an individual, Gump, makes during those historical chaos. I cried a lot watching this movie because every character was me, my parents, my grandparents, my neighbor, and my heroes. Gump's warm heart really console me at difficult times.",10
3 January 2000,Revisionist history:- after only 30 years.,"The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.

Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.

This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were ""Unamerican"" in every sense of the word.

The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.

It's enough to make a person gag.

Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either.",5
22 March 2022,Nearly perfection,"It's hilarious, and it is tragic.

Tom Hanks is...amazing as Forrest Gump, striking the balance between ""stupid"" and ""normal"", as many choose to describe people.

There's parts where you can feel how sad it is, but it's not crammed in there, or overpowering. It strikes the right balance with the comedy.

Somehow, this movie has found a way to be underrated, as it has 70% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics.

10 June 2000,No one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American public,"This is a ""cute"" movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say nothing of technologically advanced. Let's face it, this guy Gump knew everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a ""dull normal"" in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!

18 September 2013,Uplifting & Wondrous Fable.,"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump in Robert Zemekis's Academy Award winning(Best picture, director, & actor) fable about a simple and honest man who finds himself floating through life like(the ever-present) feather in the wind. He is often bullied growing up, but finds solace in his best friend Jenny, whom he comes to love dearly as they get older. She tells him to ""run Forrest, run"" and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt. Dan(played by Gary Sinise) whose life he saves, giving him a medal and inspiring him to be a Ping-Pong champion, where he meets three different U.S. Presidents, and later becomes a multi-millionaire by investing in ""a fruit company"" that takes off in a big way. He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again...

Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it. A truly marvelous achievement by all.",9

6 September 2023,A unique & wonderful modern-day tall tale,"Much like the titular character, Forrest Gump is such a unique movie. It walks, or rather runs, the fine line between drama and comedy so effortlessly that it doesn't feel jarring when the tone shifts. Plus, I think some may have forgotten how groundbreaking the visual effects in this film were. Tom Hanks is unforgettable as Forrest, and his performance made an impact in pop culture that was almost as big as the many cultural & political events portrayed in this modern-day tall tale. It's a wonderful experience to see a timeline of our country's history through the childlike eyes of Forrest Gump.

5 September 2005,I used to love this movie.,"*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers ***

Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.

A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.

I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.

The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.

And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.

It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.

Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.

As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.

As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already.",6

16 March 2009,The Ultimate Fad Movie,"""Forrest Gump"" is the ultimate fad movie. It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation. It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history, and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important. But all these years later, this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable.

The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion. It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.

Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.

This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.

12 September 2002,"Technically Brilliant, Otherwise Barren","Yes, I watched in awe as Tom Hanks was digitally inserted into all the major events of the second half of the twentieth century, but my already opened jaw then went slack at the banality of the screenplay.

Sorry, but ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" is not a philosophy for a grownup. Or even a retard.

I loved the opening shot, and was really wanting to like this film, but Sally Field is embarrassing, ditto Tom Hanks. Gary Sinise is good, but Robin Wright's character makes no sense.

There IS no moral or philosophical coherence to this film ... it just allows woolly thinkers around the world to project their own feel good mantras onto it.

This is Excellent Entertainment, but could be Dangerous Entertainment. It's like those Infamous Subliminal Messages you Hear about that Enter the Subconscious without Your Consent or Knowledge. In this Movie nothing is Hidden, it is Unabashedly Up-Front about its Intent.

This is a Fun Film but be Advised. It has a Political and Social Agenda. In one of the First Scenes the Audience is shown how Forrest got His Name. From one of the Founders of the Ku Klux Klan. And We're off and Running.

Gump's Unanswered Love for His Sweetheart Jenny is Hammered Home throughout and She, along with any other Liberals are Treated here with Contempt and Her Behavior towards Forrest Gump is more than Contemptful, it is Hateful until the Bitter End in this ""Sweet"" Movie.

If this Film is Approached with just a Little Cultural Awareness and Realize that it is Manipulating the Audience on All Levels, it can be Enjoyed as a Philosophical Point of View on any Number of Subjects. But the Filmmakers Know that most Folks are not that Discerning and Therein Lies the Danger.",8
30 September 1999,Good if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge,"The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'. ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show'). Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'. I took this as a deep personal affront. I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront. It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long. Ah, well. Life imitates art.

Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue. Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing. The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply. He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on. (If only a bomb had landed on his foot. It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)

The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.

`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.",2
28 June 2007,Overrated melodrama,"Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.

As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext ""In America""). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.

And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours ""disease of the week"" performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" - why did that get overlooked?).

But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special.",4

11 March 2014,"Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in ""Forrest Gump""","YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutes

I haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.

THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.

""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.

Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:

-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.

-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""

-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).

-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.

-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.

-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).

-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.

-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).

-- Keep your word.

-- Pray and have FAITH.

-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.

We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.

From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?

Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""

Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fianc√© at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).

""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.",9
14 February 2010,...And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump,"I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.

The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.

When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.",10
4 March 2017,Gets Better Every Time I Watch It,"When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with ""Gump"".

For a very basic summary, this movie tells the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple mind, touches so many others.

First and foremost, this is a movie that perfectly captures the angst of the Baby Boomers generation. Throughout the course of the film, everyone takes a stand on something and refuses to budge. Jenny is a hippie, Lt. Dan has a death wish, and even Mama Gump is okay with her boy selling out for U.S. ping-pong. The ultimate point made, however, is that such behavior cannot last forever and eventually one has to find their true self. That's exactly where Forrest comes in, as he never loses himself to begin with. Despite his simple mind, he ""knows what love is"" and shows it to everyone around him, even when they are using him for various reasons. In a swirling, turbulent world, Forrest is a bastion of self-awareness (ironic, as his awareness in other life areas is so low!).

In order for all those things to work, it takes the acting performance of a lifetime--exactly what Hanks is able to give. There may never be a more deserved Best Actor Oscar given to anyone, as he perfectly nails both ""goofy simpleton"" and ""emotionally self-aware adult"", often in the the same scene. As many juicy themes as there are for Zemeckis to work with, this is as much a Hanks masterpiece as anything else

Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" is no less than landmark cinematic effort. It captures the essence of Baby Boomer social struggles and does so in ways that make it timeless. Much like Zemeckis' earlier ""Back To The Future"", it is also a film in which not one scene is wasted. There is something interesting to either behold or ponder in quite literally every frame. Every time I watch this movie, I appreciate it a little bit more.",10
23 July 2002,Over-rated and disappointing!,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

12 September 2014,Sincere and Sweet,"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives little¬Öat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are fought¬Öyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and na√Øve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybe¬Öor maybe it's just great filmmaking.",9

Forest Gump: Movie review by Josephine

So, it's about this really stupid grown-up and there's blood and stuff and it's not appropriate for anyone else in my class, probably, but, you know, you guys let me watch stuff like this. What is up with that? And there's this really bad girl named Jenny, and I hated her clothes. But once she cuts her hair she turns good again. And a guy with no legs, who was weird. He made shrimp, which is gross, except for the popcorn kind. He got a lot better when he cut his hair, too. I liked it. It was funny. Can I watch it again tonight?

18 April 2010,"Sometimes American Movies Are Like a Box of Gooey Chocolates, and Gump is Pure Sap: One of the Silliest Movies to Win Best Picture","There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".

Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so.

A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.

So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?

During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.

The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.

The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why I avoid them.",3

20 September 2023,Best ever made,"Released in 1994, the critically acclaimed and widely beloved film Forrest Gump tells the story of the titular Forrest (Tom Hanks), who's written off by many due to his low IQ, but he continually proves that he's an extraordinary man through his key roles in major moments in history. Forrest's kindness and compassion are the defining traits of his character, as well as his desire to contribute to changing history. In addition, Forrest and those around him demonstrate an impressive level of wisdom about the world they live in. This means that the film is full of inspiring and memorable quotes. You'll love it.

8 October 2006,"Like the chocolate in a box, my feelings are mixed....","(r#79)

I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn't an extremely well made movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. The ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but I still can't help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. There are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself.

The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and I loved both ""Sling Blade"" and the more obscure ""Den Enfaldige M√∂rdaren"". In the former, Billy Bob Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, Bad Santa. In ""Den Enfaldige M√∂rdaren"", Stellan Skarsg√•rd was also utterly believable. But I just can't buy Hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsg√•rd, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human and real as you and me. Hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He's just too goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. I did laugh at Gump's cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just ""Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"".

Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'Gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way.

This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. On the surface, ""Gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. At least Hanks and Sinise do their best.",7
30 June 2002,Surest Way to Win an Oscar,"Make a movie about a retard, or play one. Look at Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or Miles in ""Ryan's Daughter"", they won Oscars for playing retards too. You can't go wrong with a stupid person as the focus, sort of like the chimp lead. Better yet, endow him with all sorts of savant-like talents like superhuman strength and sports agility. What silly, contrived hokum. This is a sentimental piece of schlock that is always simple and forced. ""Life is like a box of chocolates"", yeah, right! The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth. It proves that pop culture really sucks. ""Pulp Fiction"" was it's dark Oscar nominated rival in 1994. It was a better movie with a sicker message so it lost to this treacle,

8 July 2010,"The movie works overall, but like a box of chocolates there are way to many bad pieces here and there.","""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

25 January 2020,Must watch!,"An absolutely remarkable film about a decent, humble man who throughout his life met a few presidents, fought in Vietnam, was a professional Ping Pong player and ran around the whole country of America while also meeting celebrities like John Lennon and Elvis Presley. A truly heart changing film that will change your life forever. After all this Forrest had an I.Q of 75 but that didn't stop him.

12 August 2015,A good movie but it's not the masterpiece that many say it is,"This is a good movie for what it is but I really don't know why people say it's one of the best films ever made.

Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he has accidentally been present at many historical events. While sitting on a park bench, he tells strangers about what he experienced in life and the people he met.

The musical score is well-done and perfectly timed. It hits all the right notes at the right time. It does a great job drawing different emotions out of the audience.

Also, I think that this is a very entertaining feel-good movie. It is also pretty compelling. It has a nice message as well. It's message is that you can achieve all you can in life. It can inspire many people and it does a great job doing what it wanted to do. However, then there are the flaws.

Firstly, the movie often gets crippled under its own sentimentality. I get that the movie was trying to draw emotions out of the audience but it does it too often. Its sentimental moments can be real overwhelming at times. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending seemed to exist just to add more unnecessary sentimentality to the movie.

Also, this movie is overlong and stretched-out. It could've been cut down a lot. Several scenes I felt could've been cut down or could've been completely left out altogether. I grew bored several times throughout.

In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie and I like it for what it is. I just don't think it's anything special like many people say it is.",5
26 August 2022,Exquisite warmth,"Delicate and warm American theme. The different fates of Forrest Gump and Jenny are almost a mockery of the affirmative action movement in the 1960s, and Forrest Gump's burial of Jenny is also the burial of America's own history in the 1960s. The writing is beautiful, the editing is clever, the monologues are soulful, and Tom Hanks' acting is flawless, but the film's values are dubious. So divided.

10 December 1998,why I think this movie stinks,"first of all, I've only seen this movie once, but I was actually very offended by it. It takes itself far too seriously. The commentary embedded in the film's core, relating to the 60s revolution and drug use in general, are shockingly naive, reactionary, and simple-minded. This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as ""simple truths"" much like its foggy-headed main character. Not so. It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues. This movie is for people who voted for Reagan.

30 May 2016,Real Message,"My friend suggested me to watch this movie. I didn't expect anything out of it, just wanted to pass some time. After the movie ended, I felt like I had never seen anything like this before.. It even made me write a review. Such a beautifully made movie, has got everything. Teaches you about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our life as granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tells you how to realize and work with all that you have, no matter how you are. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and his life. Not only through the eye of Forrest, but a mother, a friend and general people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come across is exceptional, and all you will leave behind is love and respect. Magnificent movie.

15 February 2016,No one does it better than Tom Hanks.,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man.

2 September 2001,A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.,"Once again, I watched ""Forrest Gump"" for Christmas. While it isn't a ""Christmas Movie"", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.

To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.

This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine.

Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way ""A Wonderful Life"" has become a classic.",

11 September 2003,Only In America,"I remember the BBC coverage of the Oscars in 1995 . Barry Norman was asking the Brits in Hollywood - Among them Tracey Ullman and Alan Parker - what they thought of the years nominations and the British view was unanimous that FORREST GUMP was nothing more than an overated mediocre movie . After seeing the film for myself I`ve got to agree with the standard British view - This is an overated mediocre movie

It`s impossible to believe anyone outside America could love this movie . The overated ( Third time I`ve used that word in this review ! ) Tom Hanks plays Forrest the local town idiot who experiences many of the truimphs and torments of 1950s 60s and 70s America , and it`s all produced , played and written in a sickly sweet way , so sickly sweet you should watch this with a bucket in your hand so you don`t get any vomit on the carpet.

Amazing fact . Both American and non American voters on this site give FORREST GUMP an identical voter average - 8.1 . I`m at a loss to explain this",4

6 February 2002,"""Bye Bye Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country.""","I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big').

Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.

Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10",
25 July 2002,How is Gump ageing?,"I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it had improved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance! The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically the film is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sickly and insubstantial.

In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents of social change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If it wasn't so nauseating it would be funny.

Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars, when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly and morally bankrupt its a disgrace.

Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book ""Vietnam War Movies"" wrote; ""Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worrying is that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give this evil little film a U certificate. How can we protect our children against such insidious brainwashing"" How accurate an insight.",3
5 April 2002,Jon Monsarrat review: an overly sappy soap opera,"I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.

Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.

These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.

Who should see this film:

-- Soap opera fans

-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do have

an artistic film school depth

I'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout. If you don't like the first ten minutes, stop watching.",2
16 September 2004,Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film,"FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.

The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell.

Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.

On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.

According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write ""Imagine"" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.

FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.

I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob.",
1 May 2019,The 10/10 Gump,"One of the best films, well portrays the 60.70.80 years. It shows various social movements in the United States, discussions about loyalty and love of neighbor. 10/10 cinema masterpiece with certainty

29 September 2001,"Forrest has ""gumption""!","Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy.

In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" Although it had been some seven years since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once ""loved that movie."" When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been assuaged.

By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen ""Forrest Gump."" At least once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. ""Forrest Gump,"" when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness follows.

My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl! Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... ""HALLELUJAH!!!"" Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, ""Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should be!""

And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest ""touches"" everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world.

I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" She spurred me to watch it once again. Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do. Peace and love to you, Forrest.",10
9 April 2023,Not a fan of this movie,"Over the years I had often heard how great the movie ' Forrest Gump' really is or was and it's one of the best movies ever made. My mum on the other hand thought it was boring. Over the years I kept switching back and forth as to whether or not I really wanted to watch this movie because it didnt look appealing or something I'd be interested in other than iconic pop culture line of ' Life's like a box of chocolates"" thing

Well I finally decided to watch this movie. How bad or good could it be, right? Well sad to say I didnt like this movie at all, it was boring and dragged on for too long throughout the story. I get what ' Forrest Gump' is trying to tell - appreciate the little things in life, what really means most to you and being the best that you can be even when life slaps you in the face. I get it

Im just not a fan of it and that's ok. A movie can have great meaningful lessons and themes to take a way especially if it really touched you but eh if the story is such a drag and so boring, then my interest or the movie's likeability is completely out the window

The character of ' Forrest Gump' is ok. He's wholesome, humble, simple minded, kind and not smart but means well. But eh didnt think he was all that interesting of a character. I dont know, this movie and the character itself didnt click well with me. If I had to say one good thing is the relationship between Forrest and Jenny, they both clearly loved each other but due to the traumas Jenny suffered as a child she felt unworthy and kept running away until finally overcoming her demons and accepting Forrest's love. The different paths they choose before that with Forrest somehow doing well and Jenny not so much was interesting

But overall this is not a movie I think I would want to watch again at all. Not a fan.",5
24 September 2007,That's one special man...,"I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.

It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.

I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.

Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.",10
2 March 2009,Best Picture Oscar winners are like a box of chocolates.....,"Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.

Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.

What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.

If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10",9
22 January 2019,Might be the Greatest Movie Ever Made,"If not, it's in the top 10 and a true masterpiece.

Revisiting it after over ten years, it still hits hard with so much heart and excellent writing and acting by Hanks and Wright, as well as another unforgettable role for Sinise. Might be the only movie that can make you cry and laugh out loud at the same time.

There are many morals of the story, but one that seems universal is to make the most of life with what you got. Not everyone is privileged or handed things easily and people have different unique traits, strengths, and weaknesses, but you can at least make the most out of your life even if you have disadvantages. Forrest doesn't make excuses and does what he can.

Wish they still made Oscar winners like this. Miss the good old days of pure filmmaking.

10/10.",10
29 June 2010,One of the best films of the 90's.,"""Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""

No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.

Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him. 

Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like. It's a classic in every sense of the word.",9
16 March 2006,The Good & The Bad Of Forrest Gump,"Wow, I found a number of ""good"" and ""bad"" in this movie, too much to go into detail here without writing what looks like a novel, so I'll condense my thoughts with notes here. I don't expect many to agree with me but overall I found this good very good storytelling and a film that stays with you.

The GOOD: 1 - a totally unique story back when it was released and still that way, unlike anything else I've seen; 2 - an involving story. You really care about the lead character ""Forrest Gump,"" who is magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout, with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all ""peace and love;"" 8 - a sweet, tear-jerking ending.

The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock is just fine is not a good message. (""You didn't do anything wrong, Forrest,"" says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.

Overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics."" Maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a negative light. That's too bad. I owned this DVD and got rid of it. I'm sorry I did because I'd watch it again and I've seen it three times. Love it or hate it - you don't forget it.",8
31 March 2008,"Watchable, with the right expectations","What I mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but I wouldn't pick it either. It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.

I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.

What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.

While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clich√©s and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.

The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.

I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.

If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive. But the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat.",5
5 September 2023,"A perfect movie for everyone, anytime.","9.2/10

This film made me genuinely laugh and genuinely cry. Few movies can do one of those things, this movie does it both. The story is so simply yet so compelling and fun. And Forrest narrating it to people he sat on the bench with was absolutely genius, first it's a smart way for them to tell the story, second it gives mystery as to where he's heading off to, and third it gives us great silly moments. So because of that, this movie has impeccable pacing. It never bores you and it never overwhelms you. The smart writing does help quite a lot with that of course. Tom Hanks acts the heck out of this movie, he knocked it out of the part and utterly became Forrest Gump. You know someone's done a legendary portrayal of a character when you forget what their real personality in real life is. Gary Sinise also stole every scene he was in, and that's impressive cause Tom Hanks' aura alone carries this movie. There's just something about him and his performance here that just never gets old watching. Him and Forrest's chemistry and friendship was super wholesome. Some other things would be the amazing cinematography by Don Burgess and the underrated score by Alan Silvestri. Overall just a masterpiece in storytelling, acting and cinematography. A pop icon for a reason, anybody can watch this and not get bored. No matter how many times you watch it in your life.",9
14 March 2014,A travesty,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

3 July 2009,Overrated And Unbelievable,"The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal ""Bosom Buddies."" Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....

To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.

The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.

Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many ""good"" and ""upright"" citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better.",1

30 January 2022,Just no,"The film isn't terrible...it's actually a pretty well written movie with amazing characters...the thing that irritated me most about this film is the fact that Forrest had to wait for a woman who didn't want him in her prime only for her to settle with Forrest until she was past her prime, abused and all used up. That was just not fair on the main character...I don't care if you guys here on IMDb have a different opinion, or you don't like what I am saying ...but fact is fact. That is why I will never like this movie....very overrated, bad, and definitely does not deserve to be in top 250 movies of all time on imdb....

10 July 2014,Not my favorite but the Best I've watched so far,"This is the only film for which I can use the word ""Beautiful"" without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.

Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.

Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.

The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.

p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story. And about the academy awards, open your mind.",8
20 June 2003,Absolute Garbage!,"I hated this movie when it came out and I still loathe it. All the people in the audience I saw it with were ""oooo-ing"" and ""ahhhh-ing"" at this cornball, manipulative, simplistic garbage. I notice now, nearly ten years later no one talks about this movie at all. Krap is as krap does...Hollywood garbage posing as ""art"". Ugh...save me from stuff like this... What's strange is the Zemekis' next movie, ""Contact"" was Excellent. It's one of my favorite movies. Go figure...

Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

1 October 2011,Simply one of the Greatest American Films ...,"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.

Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""Forrest Gump"". There are no villains in ""Forrest Gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.

The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.

And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget ""My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump""? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.

And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""Run, Forrest Run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.

That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix ¬Ö ""Forrest Gump"" is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.

And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""Forrest Gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.

This is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""Forrest Gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only ""felt like running"". Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is"". On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!",10
2 December 2006,Why so high in the Top 250????,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

2 December 2001,Disappointing is the very least I can say,"I was chided for not having seen this film...now I can chide back. I really shouldn't be writing about it since I DID NOT see the whole thing. Yes, I had to turn the DVD off after an agonizing hour. What a ""cute"" movie, but that's all it is. And to think academy voters chose this stupid, egotistic film over Shawshank Redemption. It's a sign that Hanks has way too much academy pull. Great actor but the film comes up short. Don't be chided into renting this thing.

21 April 2009,A magical and powerful celebration of life. A true classic.,"Every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.

I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.

But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.

Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this ‚Äì in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.

Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.

Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. Forrest Gump is a classic that will look handsome in any DVD collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older I get. A true classic.",10
29 April 2021,Amazing move all well acted,"Best film story and perfect acting by all. You connect with all the characters. Emotional and funny yet entertaining. Gary Sinise will always be 'Lt Dannn!!' to us. Unforgettable and Unbelievable.

11 June 2013,A Perfect Film,"Wow. An incredible film. I watched many other movies of Tom Hanks, Now i understand that i made a great mistake by not watching this movie this long. This is such an epic. Terrific acting by Tom Hanks, dint knew that he was this versatile. The film just creates a very good feel inside you that even after watching it just hangs within your mind. Gump is spontaneous with great talent even though he looks retarded. Every scene in the movie drags our full attention into it, by the spontaneous actions of Gump. The movie's BGM is also perfect and syncs nicely with the scenes. Everything, everything is perfect for this film. Such films are extremely rare. This should have been a multi Oscar winner and indeed, it is. Watch it. No other words. Just watch and feel.

14 June 2006,"Read the book, avoid the movie","I read the book and saw the movie back in the 90s when both were out and popular. The book was wonderful. The movie was pure junk!

All the darkly sad and darkly humorous parts of the book were completely chewed up and regurgitated into pablum for the masses, so that Forrest Gump the Movie would be the feel-good experience of the year. Which it was, apparently. The masses are stupid.

If I was the author of this book, I'd be pi**ed at this movie.

This review requires 10 lines, but if I were to write more, it would be to give too much of my valuable time to this crappy movie.

But I want to warn intelligent viewers out there who might not have seen this clap-trap yet, to avoid it.

So I will try to accomplish 10 lines via the return key.

Do I have 10 lines yet?

Edited 9/20/96 - adding 1 star to this; I've seen the worst movie ever made (Crash-1996) and it's a true 1-star; no movie deserves to be in the same class as Crash, therefore I am adding 1 star to all my previously rated 1- and 2-star flicks.",2
8 December 2000,"Preachy, Simplistic, and Sappy","Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan.

Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime.

This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way through to the ""resolution"" with Jenny at the end.

With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.

Watch this film and ask yourself ""What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?""

Forrest seems to have made the ""right"" choices and been at the ""right place at the right time"" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?",4
3 August 1998,Like a box of chocolates,"A much more likable character than the one in the original novel, Forrest takes us on a surreal tour of every major event in the period during the birth of the civil rights movement and the anti-war era. He is so simple, open, and direct, that the audience can't help but like him. The film is at various times funny, sad, exciting, and moving. Tom Hanks so personified this modern Huck Finn that he well deserved his second Oscar.

18 July 2023,A recent day classic...,"One cannot dispute that the 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump"" is indeed a relatively modern day classic. And it is one of those movies that everyone is familiar with.

Writers Winston Groom and Eric Roth put together something very unique and memorable when they concocted the script and storyline for this movie. And it is indeed a very memorable movie, one that actually leaves a lasting impression and impact on the viewer. Even now in 2023, ""Forrest Gump"" is still a movie that very much holds its ground and proves even as enjoyable and entertaining today as back in 1994. So thumbs up to writers Winston Groom and Eric Roth on that accomplishment.

And of course the impressive acting performances put on in the movie were a big part of making the movie so beautiful and memorable. Tom Hanks simply is phenomenal in this movie, and he shines in every single scene that he is in. The movie also have some great performances from Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field.

The character gallery in the movie is great as well, another testament to the writing skills of Winston Groom and Eric Roth.

I do believe that ""Forrest Gump"" is one of those type of movies that will forever stand as a watchable and enjoyable movie. And that certainly makes it a very good movie.

My rating of director Robert Zemeckis's 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",8

He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

17 May 2007,A story that contains all,"This is the ultimate movie. It contains within it all of humanity and human history, wrapped around one special guy: Forrest Gump. Gump is clueless to this fact, he is just looking at the moment or forward, and in the process he changes history and fates of humans around him to the better.

I recall no other movie that has satisfied me as a human in such way as this, in both drama, comic and thrill, with a manuscript that seems god-made in it's completeliness.

Only a few other movies ever made, can get close to Forrest Gump, if you ask me!

23 April 2023,Precision-tuned to win hearts and awards,"Not having seen ""Forrest Gump"" for decades, the online cynicism really started to take hold with me; the American mythology, evil Jenny memes and the obedient simpleton messaging; it put me in a weird headspace for this particular rewatch. But here's the thing: it's just so well-made.

No one in this move feels out of place and most of the humor lands as intended. It's not hard to see why this movie swept the Oscars and ticket sales; we're talking Hanks and Zemeckis here, it was a '90s dream team. I'll admit I kinda checked out during the cross-country running scenes, but I was right back in when Haley Joel Osment showed up (it's all heartstrings from there).

If there's anything about the movie that doesn't work for me, it's the people around Forrest; most of them end up either sick, ruined or dead, and I had a real problem with that. Jenny fares the worst here, and she honestly deserved better. I hate her father with the power of a thousand suns.

I get all of the criticism over the years, I guess I just don't agree. This is by any measure a good movie, and my rating would probably be higher if I wasn't so sick of hearing about it. My brain tends to lump this in with ""The Lion King"" for that reason.",6
24 February 2002,Ridiculous,"This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous accents, too many special effects, unbelievable story. The high point is young Haley Joel Osment as Gump Jr, and it's only at the very end of the movie that we see him.

5 November 2005,A thoroughly nasty piece of work,"This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw it away.

I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work, how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.

Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office success and win multiple Oscars.

Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work. I still hated it.",1
24 February 2016,One of the best cinematic works of our time,"Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.

Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?",
21 July 2006,A Journey You Simply Cannot Miss...,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war.

4 June 2001,You're dumb...,"...but the USA can make you rich, healthy and famous with the minimum trouble to make this a pure Hollywood movie. Should I say that this movie, though cast is okay and directing conventional, is much overrated. This movie seems made for a religious and puritan American audience, and it received here in France a particularily mixed opinion. Script has to my mind many flaws, music is irritating, and again I completely disapprove the meaning... so watch it (once only) if you have time and make yourself an opinion but don't think you are going to watch a wonder just because of its 6 academy awards! 6/10

15 March 2016,A man with a mental disability lives through and takes part in many points of history.,"Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever to be shown on the silver screen and only solidified by a stellar performance by the cast and crew. One of the few films everyone can say they have at least seen once, this movie deserved every Oscar it won and will go down in history as one of the best and well-done films ever to be created. Many can say that this film does have some very minor issues, things such as the questionable moral depicted by the love interest, Jenny, throughout the course of the entire film. Some could take umbrage with the less-than amazing special effects (though the time of production should be added into context).

21 June 2001,One of the best of the 90's,"I have seen Forrest Gump about 15 times, and every time it drives me to tears. It shows how a man who is not exactly ""right"" can be very successful and lead a full life. I hear people all the time criticize this movie, but why? How can't you love this movie? Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas. Tom Hanks pulls in a great acting performance as Forrest and their are other great performances, also. Too many of them to name. It deserved that Oscar. I feel that wholeheartedly. I give it an A+.

11 September 1998,Will be classic in years to come,"Forrest Gump is one of the best films Tom Hanks has done. In this 1994 film his portrayal of Forrest recaptures the sprit of his classic performance in Big (1988). The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse turning in performances that deserved Oscars. Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R. Hall who plays Young Jenny will probably forever be associated with the line ""Run Forrest Run!"")

In conclusion, a film which given time to mature will be a classic.

5 January 2007,Simply Unmissable and Totally Unforgettable,"This movie is the story of a little boy with below average intelligence, but with a heart that's worth far more than a few little I.Q. points.

Tom Hanks delivers this outstanding character to the screen and his performance is truly captivating; just like the story of his life. The beautiful Robin Wright brilliantly portrays Forrest's most cherished friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny. And this review wouldn't be complete without thanking Gary Sinise and Sally Field for their wonderful contribution to this truly heartwarming experience.

Forrest's story sees him touch the hearts of the entire world with his simple innocence and strong will to do only what is right; making life better for many people along his journey.

Forrest Gump is a movie that you feel as you watch, you will empathise with the character of Forrest, sharing his experiences whether they are humorous, heartwarming or tragic. And along this journey you will learn a great deal about life and its many twists of fate.

Good enough to inspire everyone, even the most cold hearted among us.

22 April 2023,Is criticizing this movie a sin?,"No matter what I say here, it won't matter. People see this movie as a classic, and I respect that. But despite the raving reviews, I was not in love with the concept; Forrest Gump is a ridiculous series of events, portrayed seriously.

The accents, the outcomes, the behavior? Ridiculous. Yet its tonality is serious... Its message? Serious. Now, perhaps the humor was just a miss for me, and there is something comedically appealing to others, or perhaps celebrating mediocrity is truly that moving to some. But in neither case was this film redeemable for me.

The pacing was slow, and to be honest I was a bit bored. But I sat through slow burns before, such as The Shawshank Redemption, and that was a far better movie. And with a much better message, plot and delivery.

I feel like I'm desecrating someone's grave here, but I stand by it. I've witnessed much more compelling storylines, acting and cinematography than this. So, 5/10 for me, but I know my opinion is unpopular and most will think differently.",5

13 July 2004,Gomer Pyle meets Rudy...,"It doesn't really surprise me that so many people think Forrest Gump is a great film... it only reconfirms my feelings about the average filmgoer. Simply a poor man's Zelig (that's another film for those who don't know) that's been dumbed down to reach the television audience. Anyone who really believes that ""Life's like a box of chocolates..."" is too naive to even be reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections were confections and some excrement. Don't mean to sound bitter but live a half century (with your eyes open!) and see if you don't agree...by the way what type of chocolate did it taste like to you when you saw the world trade center collapse? Gump is Gomer Pyle who can't sing...and before you rush to defend...it's been 10 years and what were Zemeckis' other great films?

18 November 2010,Magnificent,"To say it with a clich√©: they don't make 'em like this anymore. ""Forrest Gump"" is pretty much everything that was great about 90s cinema and more. It's incredibly long, but it isn't boring for a second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they're fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they're slow and horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president. Everything just feels right in this movie, the script doesn't have a word too few or too many. If you haven't noticed, to me this is one of the best movies ever made.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

1 June 2001,"A totally overpraised movie, and basically for US people.","Well, leaving aside the sad memories this movie brings me - which don't have anything to do with my overall point of view, I would like to express how annoying Forrest Gump results to me. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.

Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been premiered in the rest of the world. I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it, though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because the word had been out that they had to.

I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.

Five out of ten, and that's being too fair.",5
19 June 2014,One of the best films of the nineties,"1994 was a pretty good year for film. Along with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" we got ""Forrest Gump"", an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. Popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the Best Picture Oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year.

The story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted Alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. From inspiring Elvis Presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), Gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. This tour through American history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in American history will also get a kick out of it. However, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. The central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does Gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends.

That being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. Tom Hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. His performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive Best Actor Oscar. The rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. Sally Field as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright as his long-time love interest and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan all gave awards-worthy performances. Also worthy of note is Mykelti Williamson, whose relatively small role as Bubba was nevertheless highly memorable.

In terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. The story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ILM's Oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted Hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. Throughout, Alan Silvestri's Oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs.

Ultimately, though, ""Forrest Gump"" is not without its detractors. Some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. I don't agree with that at all. The movie's poignancy is well-earned and Gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life. In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, even considering its tough competition.",9
6 September 2014,It's a classic for a reason,"Forrest Gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.

As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.

1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.

18 February 2008,"Overpaid, over-rated and over here!","""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

5 December 2017,"Forrest Gump is not just heartwarming, it is a triumphant cinematic work of art with Tom Hanks exercising the role of his career","Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field).

This movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. It is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. Forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in America's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. Each scene following Forrest in the midst of the political tension including the Vietnam War, the ill-fated JFK administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. Flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see Robert Zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. Of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. The separation between him and Jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. And thanks to Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. Robin Wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. However, this comes less of a surprise than Tom Hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. Hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. Luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. He is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only Robin Wright, but his friend Gary Sinise as the well-acted Lieutenant Dan works well.

Forrest Gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. For a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. I guess it comes to show that Forrest's mother was right when she said ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.""",9
10 December 2019,Good,"Forrest Gump was good. It probably deserves higher, but I thought it lost steam these past few years. I still like Bubba Gump and the whole bus thing.

Good movie. Recommend!

2 November 2002,Simple yet elegant,"Leonard Maltin is usually right on, so I guess he can be forgiven for totally blowing this one (and for missing Animal House). Sound and Fury-esque story of idiot savant Hanks, not the sharpest tool in the shed but capable of some simple observations about living. And he gets to make a lot of observations across several decades of an eventful life, in a true tour de force by Hanks. Trick photography, placing Hanks with celebrities of the times, doesn't overshadow main tale of Hank's life-long romance with troubled Wright. Solid supporting cast is highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for Sixth Sense's child star as Forrest's son. Detractors may be taking this movie too seriously, I don't think it means to be that pretentious. Few movies in the last 50 years are so simply and beautifully told; just sit back and enjoy the story and the soundtrack. P. S. Years after writing this I came across Forrest's last lap just outside Monument Valley and did my own re-creation for the camera. It was a special moment for me.

19 May 2019,A charming romp through modern American history.,"For the longest time, I had only seen pieces of Forrest Gump (1994). After watching it in fits and starts, I finally sat down and watched the whole thing in one go probably ten years ago. Upon re-watching this Best Picture-winner, I realized how it has maintained its cultural appeal for so long. After all, it's not necessarily a story about a slow southern boy; it's the story of history and the story of America. That's not to say it doesn't have its faults, but they're relatively minor compared to the impact of the rest of the film.

What's perhaps the most impressive part of Forrest Gump is the visual effects. From digitally inserting the titular character into archival footage to removing a Vietnam War soldier's legs, even knowing these computer-aided elements are there doesn't hinder how real they look. Although, being able to match the visual tone and style of several decades was equally as impressive. It's almost laughable how one character could be a coincidental part of so many iconic events of the late 1900's, but I suppose that's a lot of the charm of this film.

My one qualm with this movie also aligns with the spot in the plot where I generally used to stop watching. When the main character starts running across the country with no apparent supplies (water, food, etc.), my suspension of disbelief was broken. If anything, it was only meant as a chance to show off American geography (and move the timeline forward a few years), whereas the previous two hours was primarily American history. Some might also fault Jenny's (Robin Wright) poor life decisions as well, but I think it's merely indicative of what can happen to people who are sexually abused as children.

A charming romp through modern American history, I give Forrest Gump 4.5 stars out of 5.",9
29 April 2007,"Fun, funny, and even educational, but depressing.","Was Forest Gump made with the intention of being a depressing movie? I don't really think so. I think it was made with the intention of being sad at parts, but ultimately a feel good movie that was supposed to be quite funny at parts, entertaining, and even educational...not to mention a great soundtrack.

For me, the movie was all those things, but unfortunately, I found the film, throughout all these jokes and happy moments, to be depressing. For a guy who doesn't cry much at movies, I bawled at this one.

I don't really know what my point is...I was sad.

13 December 2019,"""Culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant""","It has been 25 years since I saw it in a movie theater upon its original release back in 1994. I am glad I finally had this opportunity to watch it again after all these years. Robert Zemeckis is a great storyteller and Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field all achieve outstanding performance. Forrest Gump won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing. It also won many other Awards and Nominations, including Golden Globes Peoples Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards.

1 May 2004,Keep your rotten chocolates,"I can't believe this insultingly stupid, trite, and flabby film was nominated for any awards. The film is simply meaningless, having no comprehensible point of view and unwilling to look one millimeter past the surface of any of the events it attempts to depict. Something like this is even more flatulent and offensive than action garbage like _ConAir_, which at least doesn't pretend to have Something To Say.

The popularity of this movie escapes me completely. I guess it makes people feel good about themselves in some sick way: ""My life is bad, but lookie - this retarded man gets to interpret the highlights of American history and popular culture for me!"" Hanks, who I normally like, seems to have based his performance on not blinking, or maybe he was just drugged (a rational response to the uber Hallmark Card that passes for a screenplay.) Wretched garbage appropriate for people scared of thinking.

10 December 2011,An amazing life. An amazing movie.,"Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as Forrest Gump. He's such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.

So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what ""smarter"" people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.

The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.

The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.

Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have been the smartest one of all.",9

18 June 2020,Run!,"The life and times of changing America through the eyes of simple man. A lovely and warming film with Tom Hanks as the lead character telling the story of his life and how things have changed around him. Gump leads an extremely full life but despite everything he does; going to war, going for a long run, inventing crazes, playing sports, meeting presidents, catching shrimp - despite everything, all he wants to do is be reunited with his childhood sweetheart Jenny. It's fair to say that when life throws a problem, he just gets on with it and does his best, showing the audience that it's not worth being down about big things, not when life is so wonderful and varied. Hanks shines and is somehow hypnotic as Gump, grabbing the audience and taking them for a ride. Robin Wright (it's only ""The Princess Bride"" folks!!) is brilliant as Jenny, making you love her and hate her in equal amounts. I also must mention how good Gary Sinise was as Lieutenant Dan - like Jenny I hated him and loved him in equal amounts. His character development is brilliant and goes to highlight that anyone can change. Furthermore, one of the messages of the film (amongst all the others), a small interaction with somebody could have a lasting effect on them - that's how Dan turns out after having known Forrest Gump.

This is a pure and inspiration emotional rollercoaster of dramatic film. There are some tongue in cheek moments where factual history is manipulated a little bit, but it's easy to look past these and see a true classic of cinema. If you have not seen this, it is worth rectifying that and watching a true gem as soon as possible - perhaps bring some tissues though.

20 January 2021,The Bohemian Rhapsody of movies,"Forrest Gump is a movie that tries, and succeeds, to be moving, adventurous, funny, heartbreaking, heartwarming and endlessly creative. As the movie weaves in and out of Jenny's tragic storyline it drags the viewer through the full gamut of emotions. Gump is probably Hanks' finest character, a man whose affable simplicity cuts through the chaos of life in a truly life-affirming manner. Beautiful storytelling.

23 July 2006,"Obnoxiously politically correct, but...","In all fairness and all clich√©s and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level.

If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack.

However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is.

The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film.

Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.

Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable.

15 May 2019,A sweet movie,"I've seen this movie twice and I really liked it. It's cool to see Tom Hanks as the titular character in these different time periods from the 50's when rock was becoming popular to the 60's when there was so much division in the states (especially about the Vietnam war in which he would serve in at one point as well as the Civil Rights movement). The actors do a great job portraying their characters. Gary Sinese as the bitter veteran is sympathetic to watch and Jenny, Gump's love interest is a good example of a star crossed lover. This movie's heartwarming and just like a box of chocolates. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself.

20 August 2002,"Redundant, Sentimentalist Crap","For the life of me I will never understand the popularity of this movie. It is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic mess.

The entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until eventually I just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching another minute. That gimmick consists of inserting Forrest into an historic event and watching him emerge triumphant. That the film repeatedly has Forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times in recent American history---Vietnam, segregation, the Cold War, etc.---is an insult to the people who lived through those times. To say that Forrest, with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually experienced the event into which Forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an affront to America itself.

One of the greatest tragedies in its Oscar sweep is that ""Gump"" won for Best Editing over ""Hoop Dreams,"" a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage. ""Hoop"" is riveting for every minute while ""Gump"" drags on and on with superfluous scene after superfluous scene. Could that ""Forrest running back and forth across the US"" have possibly been milked any longer? This lasts 15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of time.

And as for Forrest's ""soul mate,"" Jenny, this little slut is a despicable character who abuses Forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect. This character does not deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt.

""Forrest Gump"" is woefully, abominably bad. Its main gimmick is cute the first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade comes crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (Hanks is an Oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both ""Cast Away"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"") and inept editing.

In my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all Best Picture Oscar winners.

3 February 2017,"Schmaltzy and overly folksy, but works","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple, slow-witted boy from the country. We see his life story, his simple home-spun sayings that get him through life and how he manages to nonchalantly participate in some of the most momentous events of the 1960s.

Simple, but fun. Overly folksy and schmaltzy, but works. Not too profound but if you don't think too much, it's quite enjoyable. The weaving into the plot, and the footage, of actual historic events is wonderful to behold and adds a great comedic element to the movie too.

Won the 1995 Best Picture Oscar, though certainly wasn't the best film of that year. The other nominees were fantastic: Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption and Quiz Show, yet the weakest of the five won the award. I guess the Academy wanted something sappy and simple, not something gritty or clever, to win.

4 August 2019,This is pure gold.,"Forrest Gump has been one of those movies that stuck with me even though many years have passed since I watched it the first time. The journey through the life of the dim-witted but ever lovable Forrest Gump is just so touching, funny, sad everything you know from life is represented here in some way.

To be honest, there are times when the characterization of Gump as a person with less the average IQ points can be a little too much, but if you look at it through the interplay with the characters he meets, then it becomes an eye-opener.

Especially when he is sharing the screen with either his love interest Jenny, the war time comrade Bubba or his stern but loyal lieutenant Dan Taylor. Those characters stay with you in some way, because they are som well written in the context of Forrest's story. The fact that you don't always get on well just because you're smart. Life is harsh, but when it is, look out for your loved ones.

And how the technicians managed to mix Tom Hank's person into that footage of historical events is still baffling. I had a blast watching it every time it appeared.

Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. An undoubted masterpiece.",10

9 January 2001,Idiot Savante or Lucky Jinx ?,"Forrest Gump is a wonderfully magical and enduring film of nostalgia through the eyes of one man who is so beat up inside that he doesn't mind getting rained on. Almost everyone he has ever met or known ends up with a fortune of bad luck (Elvis, Lennon, his mom, Bubba, the Kennedys, Wallace,,) as he further goes on granting good luck on others by creating or contributing to Elvis's movements, mooning, smiley faces, jogging, Watergate, Lennon's lyrics and the Chinese peace movement. The altering of the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person. There is a message behind this movie that suggests that we only gain personal fulfillment through trying to improve the lifestyles of the others on this planet. This is a movie meant to be watched over and over.

21 June 2018,A magical fictional biographical story,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

6 May 2004,Apparently stupid people can become millionaires by blind luck. Who knew?,"Everybody talks about how great this movie is. Will someone tell me why? So a stupid guy wanders through the world, saying all kinds of stupid stuff, chasing a drug addicted stripper, and by blind luck wanders into millions of dollars? Yeah, I can see why that's so popular. It seems like this movie would make more sense as an inspirational video for retarded people.

Look! You too can be a success without the unbearable burdens of intelligence or talent. All it takes is ridiculous levels of luck.

And what about the years of running? Years of running? What is that? It's just so ridiculous. Who does that? Who? And people follow him? ""I don't feel like running anymore."" You're joking. Who wrote this because they should really be crucified.

1 June 2012,Soul Searching 101...,"Many of us go through our entire lives never really seeing the world. I don't mean the world in News reports, or on TV...I mean the beautiful world, the simple world, beyond the the hatred and dissatisfaction that assaults our senses every day. The beautiful and uncluttered world as seen through Forrest Gump's eyes.

OK, enough flowery talk. This movie will mean different things to different people, there is no doubt in my mind. For some it will be seen as nothing more than a patronizing joke, a crude attempt to make people think our world should be a fantasy land. I feel sorry for them, as they just don't get the simple message that shines throughout the movie.

For others (I hope we are a majority), we see Forrest as a gateway to our own soul. Forrest Gump experiences all the hurt, the hatred, the huge brick wall of insecurity that we all experience. Yet he continues on, finding a strength within to overcome all the obstacles placed before him...

Maybe we aren't perfect, maybe we don't know all the answers, but Forrest Gump lets you know that we don't have to be perfect to see the beauty all around us. Just look! I find myself watching this movie every time I see that it is on...",10

5 March 2020,An unforgettable masterpiece -- do you even have to ask?,"If you have to ask yourself why this movie is great, have you really watched it?

Side note: As a history buff, I especially found great pleasure in the dedication that the directors had in showing Forrest Gump going through the eras of his times.

5/5.

Also, kind of found it funny that Tom Hanks went from Forrest Gump to full-Saving Private Ryan a few years later.

7 April 2003,A dullard's Citizen Kane...,"Why do people love this movie? This movie is not only completely unrealistic, it's also boring. Almost everyone I know who saw this movie and wasn't middle aged said they liked the movie but it was too long and kind of or too boring. Does that make sense? When looking back at this movie, did it really give you anything back? This movie is illogical, stupid, pointless, and umm... like before I get too redundant, annoying. I was hoping that Forrest Gump would die in the war or like get hit by a car when he was running. That would have been hilarious and then this movie could have been up there with Toxic Avenger and Braindead. And the Academy Awards are a joke. They don't recognize really good movies usually, and I'm stil in shock that American Beauty won since it actually deserved an Oscar. I seriously think that Demolition Man or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better movie. At least Wesley Snipes had a cool hairstyle. Go rent a classic like Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice or C.H.U.D... Forrest Gump sucks and isn't he more like an anti hero? I'd rather have Leatherface or the Toxic Avenger, but who doesn't root for them anyway?",1

20 September 2010,A Film Above Words!,"Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain't worthy enough for what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis's, Watch 'Forrest Gump', and you would yourself become a fan of this man and take your words back.

IMDb writes: 'Forrest Gump', while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above words, my summary correctly copies that. It's a journey of a man left alone, it's his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud citizen.

About 140 Minutes long, 'Forrest Gump' unfolds fearlessly. This is Robert Zemeckis's finest work to date. His cinema has never been so engaging before. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay provides liberties to it's historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump & Gary Sinise, as one of Forrest's important people in his journey, pack in performances, that can surely be described as, ""Tour De Force"". Robin Wright as Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her character.

On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo, that sentence in Caps, is an understatement.",10
28 February 2011,"Forgive me for not seeing ""the greatest film ever."" I'm fourteen.","Ever have that one film that you've been getting bothered to watch, and just because you haven't seen it people feel the need to hate you and bash you? Or maybe it's just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for people to understand. It's something only I understand.

My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when people started verbally insulting me saying ""I'm not a real critic"" and ""You can't call yourself a critic if you haven't seen the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said ""OK! I'll watch it!"" The plot I won't waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to strangers while waiting for a bus. Can't get more simplistic than that.

Forrest Gump has been called by people ""a masterpiece"" and ""a classic."" While I think it's a well made film, I don't think it deserved six Oscars. I also don't think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the face for not seeing this film. It wasn't truly amazing. In fact, no film is really ""amazing."" Even the favorite film I don't call amazing. When defining ""amazing"" you'll find it's definition is ""surprising greatly."" I've seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an ""amazing"" job teaching. The film I'm waiting to define ""amazing"" has not been found.

The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing. That's about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked Shawshank better than Gump.

As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think ""Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?"" One category Forrest Gump should've won for is ""Best Musical Score."" The film includes the catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It's definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic ""Free Bird"" which was used to perfection in this film.

Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army, and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable character. Not an amazing character.

My final thoughts on ""the greatest movie ever"" go as followed; it was a damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review this film I would've enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn't annoy me so much to review it I would've enjoyed more of what it had to offer. The damage is done. I bet even after I'm done with this review people will say I didn't do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for them; s**t happens.

Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.",9
23 October 2014,I liked the script because it was a movie different,"Tonight I fell over in the movie ""Forest Gump"". You probably have seen many of you.

I saw her the first time when it came out in cinemas and touched me very very much. Asked one of my favorite movies, perhaps the most beloved.

Not because I laughed with smart funny scenes, but because ""he spoke"" for all truly beautiful feelings. Love, friendship, faith, patience, sincerity, selflessness, kindness, generosity, hope. But for children traumatized souls, or how to squander our lives on meaningless things and pleasures and lose the chance to be close to those who love us really.

Maybe I liked the script because it was a movie different from all the others and still is. I clever script. I loved the music of the beginning and end titles and interpretations of protagonists.

But for many it was just a movie about a retarded. The felt ridiculous because it is ridiculous, such a person can accomplish such things in reality. And for other reasons.

You have seen how you?",
18 June 2007,"Charming Movie, Never Know What You'll Get.","This movie is one of Tom Hanks best performances. He plays Forrest Gump and he narrates his life about having a low IQ and meeting his love interest Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). This movie It chronicles Gump's experiences, by chance, with some of the most significant people and events in American history like Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and service during the Vietnam War. Ulimately, he surprisingly makes huge accomplishments like being honorably discharged from the military and leading a healthy and successful lifestyle. It sends a strong message that even some people with low IQ could achieve the greatest in life.

Forrest touched the lives of many people, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, his successes like becoming a football star and saving the life of fellow soldiers are evidence of the superb acting, heartwarming events and awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the turmoil of the 1960s.

Overall, one of the best films in cinema history and certainly worthy of its Oscar wins.

27 January 2020,Tom hanks at his natural consuming...,"Tom hanks appears noble here. A true force of nature that is long standing, seemingly inept, yet really, hes taking it all in, and waiting to pounce.

He stares, blanked faced for a moment, as though he can see a thousand miles in front of him, attaining a capacity that a dog would have who is stranded in the winter. The dog having a double choice. Number 1: kneel before god as god bends pieces of metal with a mad face. Or 2: just be nothing in the world, just tell jenny she is unnecessary.

2 August 2016,"Excellent film, somewhat disappointing ending","This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade.

8.5/10.",8

19 September 2023,One of the best drama movies,"Forrest Gump, a cinematic classic that tugs at the heartstrings, is a compelling journey through the tapestry of American history. Its strengths are undeniable, with Tom Hanks delivering an unforgettable performance in the titular role, earning him an Oscar. The film's innovative use of CGI to insert Forrest into historical footage adds a unique visual element, and Alan Silvestri's iconic score further enhances the emotional resonance. However, it occasionally veers into sentimentality, and its episodic nature may leave some wanting a more cohesive narrative. Nevertheless, Forrest Gump deserves its 8/10 rating for its enduring charm, profound message, and its ability to make us laugh, cry, and reflect on the unpredictability of life's journey.

But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time.

They don't write scripts of this calibre any more, which is a shame.

Tom Hanks is brilliant as the mildly retarded Forest Gump. The film takes you by the hand, and shows Gumps life and experiences, both good and bad, in his own words from childhood to adulthood.

At the same time you get a basic look at modern U.S. history.

It is heartwarming and sad, funny and satirical. Cleverly weaves in so many sub plots and ideas.

Yet doesn't use excessive violence or bad language to relate powerful messages in a heartwarming story. A story all the family can watch.

A cracking film you can enjoy over and over again.",9
27 April 2004,"""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.""","Forrest Gump is easily a great movie. Tom Hanks played so well as Forrest, a shy but very understanding and good man. The plot was very well and got me through my problems. This might be the best of 1994, if not that, than it's one of the best. The tagline made people want to see this film and it did huge in the box office. This had action, emotion, comedy, and friendship which put people into a different outlook on life. I think every person should watch this film. You have to se it through Forrest Gump's eyes to believe the unbelievable. If your having stress over life, please see this film and you could change different personalities, totally. See this film!!

24 April 2013,This stupid is fabulous,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

19 September 2014,"Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.","Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.

A story of a man, who had everything going against him and yet he did whatever best he could. And when you do your best in whatever you have taken upon, you would mostly succeed. And there in lies the story of FORREST GUMP. When you are determined, even Gods would come down embracing you. Look at that scene in which there were no shrimps and after the hurricane there is plethora of shrimps and they become millionaires.

Yet, most of it is untrue and even hypothetical, like running coast to coast for 3 years. Even such fabrications will be loved and embraced, if we love this man called Forrest Gump. He does everything from meeting the president to running the whole of America to being a war hero and setting up his own business and becoming a millionaire. And did I say, this was against all the odds, he had, yes, he did not have legs and he got them back by running, he is mentally retarded, yet he proves all of them wrong by being successful in everything he does.

Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, has given us one of the best performances ever and this is a great character in itself. I have learnt from wikipedia that Robert Zemeckis the director, deviated from the novel written by Winston Groom. Now, what he did as a the director was a good thing and that is what I strongly believe. I did not read the novel though, but I loved Gump the way he is, so I think the changes were good.

Technically, I liked the editing, though nearly 2 and half hours long, it was not at all so boring. Also, the screenplay by Eric Roth was good. The direction, I loved it. Look at that feather fly from skies to Gump's feet and then fly away at the end, just a glimpse of what direction is. Special effects were great specially in terms of putting Gump with the presidents and even John Lennon, I just liked the way it was all done. Also, I loved the dialogue and what a piece of writing this was, you can turn simple things interesting by saying them in an interesting way, and this movie does that through dialogue.

Above all, I loved Forrest Gump as he is and more than anything, I loved Tom Hanks as Forrest, this is a great portrayal of a character. From dialect, to walking style to costumes, everything was appealing and interesting about Forrest Gump.

It's a 4/5 for a movie that is great in terms of characterisation of a man who has has a ""JUST DO IT"" spirit and for Tom Hanks who has given one of the best performances.",8
8 January 2007,overrated maudlin inspirational speech,"many people love this movie,some even calling it a work of art.however,i must respectfully disagree.i found the movie uninspiring,at best,at mostly one long bore.if you like your movies heavy on sap,you will like this movie.this movie at times felt like one long ""i'm okay, your okay,we're all okay""inspirational speech.if i want motivational advice,i'll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru. all kidding aside other than the film's heavy handedness,there are a few good thing about it.the acting was good,the special effects were decent.the best thing about the movie,however is its 1960's and 70's soundtrack.despite it good points,the movie is not worth recommending. 3/10

3 April 2019,Really intriguing movie,"Watched this movie today and it's just another great drama movie. The plot was just very good and had you intrigued throughout. There's a lot of funny moments, but also some sad moments which were perfectly balanced and made the movie interesting. This is up there with the best drama movies that I have seen such as Shawshank Redemption. You should definitively watch this if you haven't done so.

20 July 2022,A story that has become a classic,"An amazing story, deep meaning, great acting, catch phrases, warm memories of the film - all this is ""Forrest Gump"". Full of events and drama, the film has collected an excellent collection of various awards: Oscars, Golden Globes and the British Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

The film looks easy, but at the same time makes you plunge into history. The hero of Tom Hanks is interesting and extraordinary, he is kind and naive. This is what captivates the viewer. He wants to help or even prompt, but as you can see, he copes very well himself. I liked the visual solutions. The creators of special effects masterfully inscribed Forrest in historical moments, ""introduced"" influential people. I remember when I first watched it as a child, I was very surprised that some historical figures were being filmed in the film. It's only later that you realize that all this is a matter of masters of effects.

Forrest Gump, despite his problems with development, is very purposeful, diligent. He is a strong-willed person. Despite the fact that it was always hard for him - he was bullied in childhood and in adulthood, the young man did not give up, but showed himself to be the true creator of his destiny. Let him be incredibly lucky in many places, but Gump teaches us all to be strong and go to our goal, do good and love people. In our life, it's not easy to follow this.

Actor Gary Sinise showed himself well. A little cheeky, loving to tell the whole truth, he is a great friend to the main character, becomes a victim of war, but does not lose faith in life, although he often swears at her.

I like the love line in the movie. Forrest falls endlessly in love, has been helping his chosen one for many years, but she constantly leaves him. Gump, on the other hand, believes in the best, does not demand anything in return from her. He is sincere, kind and honest.

Forrest shows the viewer the basics of the basics - treat people the way you want them to treat you. And this works quite well in his particular case. He finds real friends, adherents and even admirers. It's not just that the people of America start running back and forth across the country after him. And he seems to find in this a solution to live on. ""Run, Forrest, run!"" These words have sunk into his soul, and into our memory for many decades.

The duration of the film is high, but it does not spoil the impression in any way, because the story is interesting to watch, to empathize with the hero. The film is beautiful, kind and sensual. After watching the view of the world changes, you feel some kind of warmth that this hero gave you. Even if you understand that this is still a film with a lot of fantastic things in it, but its main message has been heard.

21 May 2002,"Ahh, once in a while a great film like this comes along.","FORREST GUMP was the best movie of 1994. Tom Hanks is completely endearing as Forrest, a simple guy shortchanged in the IQ department, who proves that brains aren't the only things needed to succeed in this world. The movie, beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a nostalgic sweep that will carry you away. The opening shot of a feather on its way to earth is enough to make you gasp aloud, and the movie is just barely underway. Forrest Gump is also a wonder of special effects, but the less said about them, the better. The trailer and promotional pieces gave away much too much of the story. Admittedly, this movie has more than its share of plot, as it covers the decades of the '50s through the '90s. It also makes numerous pit stops along the way to encompass the momentous events that molded the times.

The Gump saga begins back in the 1950s under the cloud known as polio. Throughout the years that follow, Forrest must contend with his score of 75 on an IQ test, but the braces on his legs don't hold him back for long. Forrest, who sometimes brings to mind the innocent simpleton hero Charlie Babbit, manages to make quite a few surprising contributions to society without even trying. Sure, some of the movie is sappy, but it is served up with consummate skill and a loving heart. The supporting cast is cannily chosen. Sally (""You like me, you really like me"") Fields, who plays Forrest's mother, may hereafter be known as Sally (""Life is like a box of chocolates"") Fields. You never know what you're gonna get.",8
21 December 2017,Brilliant from the beginning to the end,"It is a flawless film. Every scene has been well thought before filming and the execution is perfect. Robin Wright plays the layered character effortlessly. Tom Hanks is awesome and I am sure that no one else could have Forrest Gump like him. He runs and talks in a beautiful way. You devolop a liking for this character almost immediately. While telling the story of Forrest Gump this movie also tells us the story of United States of America and pays tribute to the most celebrated celebrities and heroes of those times.

20 August 2015,One of the Tom Hank's Masterpiece!!!!,"""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people.",8

12 June 2008,Repulsive,"Because my English is not quite up to the task, I'm going to borrow the words of another reviewer from the UK: ""a nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle"". Frankly I couldn't put it better - this is right wing propaganda at its worst; all the more so because it's wrapped in (mostly) competent directing and acting (although Gary Sinise's ""performance"" is frankly irritating). Sorry let me rephrase and apologize to right-wing people, who are entitled to their political views: this movie is (bordering on) fascist propaganda.

There is so much to love about America, ""Forrest Gump"" brings out the worst in it. An insult to anyone's intelligence - I hope it gets remembered as the ""Leni Riefenstahl's movie"" of the Reagan area.

22 September 2018,Classic movie!,"Watched many times and although nearly 25 years later it might be look a bit dusty now and the 90s CGI not as advanced as it is now, but is one of the greatest movies and one of the finest performances of Tom Hanks. Loved the narration and the interactions with various famous people , although again some of the CGI is dated. Favorite period in the movie for me was the Vietnam section. Its a long haul movie at 2 hours 20 minutes. I never really got the message that although he had the low IQ he achieved so much in his life. Quite the contradiction. He even comes across as autistic. Still a great classic 90s movie.

27 May 2012,"A movie is like a box of chocolates, right?","Tom Hanks' convincing portrayal of an Alabama simpleton made for a remarkable story portrayed in a kind, entertaining and very poignant way. Movies should challenge your acceptance of your own status quo and capture your imagination. Robert Zemeckis understood the opportunity to tell his Hollywood slant on American history through Forrest's innocent eyes. With the bitter veteran act of Gary Sinese, and beaten path of Robin Wrights' Jenny, the focus is more on our individual choices despite life's hard knocks. Forrest grows alongside of America and even has his hand in that growth, as we all do. Idealism is as idealism does, right?

8 April 2010,The most illuminating and the best combination of comedy in drama in one movie,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result.

She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

1 July 2015,"Not overrated, just people have no heart","After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talk about autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again this movie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are several things (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Ping pong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrest is not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys all the accusations of the movie being a ""Sentimentalistic ode to stupidity and ignorance"".

There are various things with which you can explain why ""Forrest Gump"" is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only of Tom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting Gary Sinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly was able to touch with this movie's music.

Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here is the problem with understanding that this is what they call ""Modern fable"", a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talks about what happened in that time, similarly to ""The legend of 1900"" or ""the curious case of benjamin button"". This genre seems to not be understood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receives a limited amount, but present amount of hatred.

Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angry because it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from other movies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understand that it's just unreasoned hatred. Go watch it, it's truly wonderful.",8
20 October 2000,Not worthy,"I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.

When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.

I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.

Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.

The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.

`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.

Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10.",5
15 February 2014,"Entertaining and uplifting film with a great and charismatic character, Zemeckis greatest work.","Forrest Gump. Is simply impossible to dislike this film. While it don't has nothing groundbreaking or 'special' about it, is so...pleasant. Is a pleasure to watch this film, really. Is pleasant to the point of being almost a fault. If there is any film that deserves the title of 'greatest crowd-pleaser' , that one for sure is Forrest Gump.

It's above all a story about happiness, overcoming, driven by a uplifting atmosphere and involving segments(the Vietnam, the famous ending, the president's meetings) and while it has a few dramatic moments, it never takes itself too seriously to the point of turning the moment in a 'manipulative mess, like some directors usually do. Forrest Gump, believe in it or not, is not a manipulative film. It flows naturally.

Tom Hanks is spectacular here. He is brilliant as Forrest Gump, I honestly believed he was 'retarded'. All his child mannerisms were convincing. And the ending is so...great! He watching his kid entering in the bus, realizing that he would suffer the same troubles that himself passed through, is arguably the most heart-breaking scene in the entire film.

Thiw film is not really...how can I say...well, Forrest Gump isn't really important for the filmmaking story, like Pulp Fiction is, for example , but still a very good film, regardless. You will not regret watching it. 8.5/10",8
16 June 2021,Fine coming of age movie not doing anything incredible though,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

14 December 2020,"Spiritual, funny & heartwarming","Tom Hanks plays his best role in this epic spiritual tale. Having watched this at least 5 times, the movie is still captivating and surprising. In 2020, it's 26 years old and nothing makes this outdated. Hanks is great in his innocence and simple presence. The accent, the way he runs and above all: his love for Jenny. Just pure unconditional love. Like the whole movie. With no concepts of money, violence or an agenda, Forrest is the ultimate avatar of an enlightened being. He moves through life, pure by impulse, driven by love and everything just comes to him. The script is perfect, the music is great, the supporting actors like Sinise are great and the ending always leaves me with a tear in my heart. A movie this great deserves a 10.

17 January 2021,Awesome,"It's one of the most favourite film ever. Firstly, the plot that tells about the man with ""different"" mind shows that all obstacles in life can be overcome. Also it shows that the man who called ""diseased"" may be one of the most healthy man in our ill society. Secondly, the cast is amazing, I think that is the best role of Tom Hanks. So, it's simply great film.

5 July 2003,A Great Document of the Second Half of the Century,"This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my lifetime. Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century. He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have. However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality. Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child. We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS. This film is a very touching document of the second half of the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it is.

26 June 2019,A Timeless Tale,"There are few other movies that come to mind that tackle Cold War American history and foreign affairs in such a unique way. Forrest Gump tells a heartwarming story that touches everyone that watches it. Upon seeing it for the first time in a theater for the 25th anniversary screening, I was still astounded at the movie's timeless morals and sentiment. The movie really does not get old. It has its adult content so it may not be fit for kids, but I really believe this is a movie that holds broad appeal. When I was growing up in Florida, my family and I watched this nearly every day on generator power as Hurricane Charlie blew through. As I never grew tired of it then, I still do not today.

20 April 1999,Worst Oscar Winner of the 90's,"A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: ""S**t happens"". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level, ""Forrest Gump"" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous ""homage"") from such masterpieces as ""Midnight Cowboy"", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his ""stupid"" adventures.

30 June 2020,Lifes Purpose,"Not much i can say about a movie that has been analyzed so thoroughly by so many others. Its a fantastic, funny, moving movie with numerous life lessons to be learned. I really cant say anything bad about it. Except at the end of the movie its the same bus driver as it was in the beginning, probably 40 years later, and she doesn't look much older. Lol but if that is all the bad that you can say about a movie than its probably pretty spotless.

28 November 2015,Tom Hanks at his very best,"Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks best performance, This is NOT up for debate. It's the most Unbelievable believable film i think i ever did see, I watch Tom Hanks and i don't see him the 'Actor' in this role i just see the character that is Forrest Gump and to me this is a testament to Mr Hanks greatness. Forrest Gump makes my top 5 list of the greatest films i have seen and i have seen a million or so. This is just one of them films of only a few they i can watch over and over and it be as great as it always was. Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are great duo but this is there very best to date. Perhaps Forrest Gump may not be Hanks best film because i believe that title is The Green Mile, Tom Hanks as an actor was a generation best and still continues to be great.

8 February 2016,It is all about Shrimp.,"It is all about Shrimp.

Forrest Gump show us how a well done thing is the best way to achieve great results. This stories is about so basic things, but so amazing at same time, we understand that sometimes be idiot is good. Forrest isn't the most intelligent man, in really Forrest is just talented, but he don't know, in reality we are like he. He can make things so big, and he can make things who inspire millions. Forrest is a example of don't plan your life, just live your life. This is the main argument: you don't need to be the most intelligent people in the world, you just need to be your self, and you will find follow in the most crazy you can imagine, because it is life, it not logical, but it is how works.

1 February 2002,A good story,"The Germans have a word for events that appear to be the result of a joke played by fate or history. It is called treppenwitz. I don't know if the filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit of it. Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as his naivet√© impels him not only through his own life, but also through many critical moments in history. But, where many quirky takes on history dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the touching nature of its simple protagonist. As the story slips in and out of historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest, because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening impartially.

Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and sententiousness. But we realize that while we condescend to the verities that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth within them. His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others. His credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier aspects.

The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in. I'm not a big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the magic of Hollywood.",
8 May 2019,A sensitive journey through a tumultuous America,"Arguably Tom Hanks' finest example of his acting range, Forrest Gump is about as challenging a role a modern actor could be charged with: trying to merge compassion and inadvertent humour alongside mental impairment is a recipe for disaster, but Hanks navigates it flawlessly. The incidents of Watergate, Vietnam and several presidencies are retold through the life of a boy-turned-man swept up by these current affairs, all whilst trying to get back to his childhood love Jenny (Robin Wright).

By having several stories contained within one film, emotional ties are given more value, spanning years and experiences. In particular, Forrest's relationship with Lt. Dan (Gary Sinese) is enduring, lasting even after the events during their time in Vietnam. Several large historical events are (somewhat fictionally) retold, with Forrest managing to crop up in the most unlikely places - however, his naivety shines through, giving the film a lighthearted touch that can be lost when tackling issues as serious as war and racism.

Forrest Gump's brilliance is through making a scene funny one second, before pulling on heartstrings the next. This seamless transition is a true feat in cinema, represented by Forrest Gump's overwhelming success (winning 6 Oscars in 1995). This film is also truly unique in its ability to be entertaining for almost any demographic - represented by its enduring success 25 years later.",9

20 August 1998,"Only YOU can prevent ""Forrest""","Did I see the same movie as the rest of the world? I thought this movie was lousy. It couldn't have been less interesting.

The only thing that got me was how they made Gary Sinise's legs disappear; and that was a momentary curiosity at best, an interesting f/x. That was very well done, no question about it.

I am very sentimental, at least when it comes to movies; this movie didn't touch me at all.

Tom Hanks was obnoxious, at best. Robin Wright Penn is miscast and I have yet to see her in a movie in which she should have been in. I love Sally Field but even she cannot rescue this for me.

This may be the movie I dislike the most...the fact that it won Best Picture, Actor etc. makes me hate it even more, and usually I don't care what the Academy thinks since I question the whole thing to begin with.",1
30 March 2020,"I'm not a smart man ,but I now what love is.","Gump love yourself, care about what they have, even the way, braving the, even the rain the sun and the stars, he only know how to love, and love is the greatest power in the world, love makes people open the heart, calm your anger, dissolve the hatred, to placate the loneliness, rallying the despair, adhere to the goal, in short, the power of love is too strong, like solar energy to melt the ice, like silly gump ran into the university, was granted special importance, I had an interview with presidents, is representing the national honor, is unthinkable. Love is everyone in the yearning and pursuit of the spiritual field, but the material society often let people because of the text incisive and ignore the content of the deep. So in the movie forrest gump expressed everything with love, the world bowed to him.

""Most of the time the state of action is filtered through the mind or thought."" We are too smart to know what is good and bad, to know what is jealous, to know what is desire, to know what is expansive, to know what is smart, but we know too much, too much percentage of our intelligence, and love is beyond our reach. Therefore, many people bowed their heads to the world, because they could not learn the art of love enough.",9

26 February 2006,Delicious Box of Chocolates ****,"Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by Tom Hanks. It's the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in the right place while monumental events are taking place in this nation's history.

Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is attempting to depict.

Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.

Gary Sinise's performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is also splendid.

Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you're going to get. With ""Forrest Gump,"" you will get the best of the best chocolates.",10

5 June 2010,Emotionally triumphant.,"Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemechis is a truly remarkable movie for me.This movie has shades of memories of my life & it has touched me emotionally in many ways.The acting of Tom Hanks is triumphant.I have never seen a better act from him & the truth is i don't want to.Scenes like Forrest having polio & with just few words of Jenny does the magic & he is able to run.Thats so beautiful.Scene of Forrest & Jenny meeting on the sea shore where everyone claps are just some amazing scenes you will ever come across.The agony of Lieutenant Dan is very amazing.Eventually movie concludes with a sad ending & the soundtrack is memorable.It shows the truth of life,you can get whatever you need in your life but still you wont get that one thing that you always want.Superb direction & brilliant acting with a touching story just makes the day for the audience.Forrest's mother reminded me of my own mother.This is an emotional experience for me as i had past of my parents related with polio,my love for the army once,as well as those romantic meets that i always want.This is triumphant.In short,verdict is if you don't see this for your emotional conscience just see it for the brilliance of Tom Hanks.Forrest Gump is emotionally triumphant for me.",10

20 May 2004,The drama! The tragedy! The pointlessness!,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

21 August 2005,Hollow,"Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow ""feel good movie"" this will fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.

At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of them. But this film certainly helped launch the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant"" found at tourist traps all across the United States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater tourist looking for a vacation for the mind.

30 January 2004,Good but not great,"I found this to be an entertaining film, certainly. However, I just don't see it as one of the top 250 films of all time. Tom Hanks does a great job playing Forrest Gump throughout the film. Sally Field as his mother is also quite good, so the problem isn't with the acting. The story is a shade weak, I think. It skips around a good bit and ends up slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story. I just don't think it was quite in the league that it currently finds itself in. All in all, a very good film, but not a great one. Looks like I'm in the minority, though!

28 June 2011,My favorite movie,"I know a lot of people may disagree but i find this to be the best movie ever made. The script, the direction and most of all Tom Hanks stunning performance made this movie perfect for me.

This movie is about a slightly mentally challenged man (Hanks) who finds himself parts of very memorable parts of history. He tries to do his best and thats exactly what happens. As the story goes on he finds himself doing amazing things throughout the world.

This is an amazing movie. Its touching, its breathtaking, its filled with action sequences, its exciting, i could go on forever because this ovie literally has everything you could want and more. There is a reason this movie won 6 Oscars in won award because it is hands down the best movie ever made. This movie is for everyone no matter who you are this movie is for you. 10/10

13 January 2012,Touching- Zemeckis offers another serving of movie magic,"Kids these days don't see the right movies. While teens flock to the latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. But there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can say I've joined that rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see.

There's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. You probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. But if you haven't, read on! There are better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.

Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40's. The film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he doesn't care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny. At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop.

There's a reason the Blu Ray box says ""Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP"". His performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like ""the loving father who liked to touch her"", ""the men who dressed up like ghosts"" and other such things the audience understands. And the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated.

But Hanks isn't the only great: the film is host to a group of great characters. There's Jenny, Forrest's childhood friend and love interest. Bubba, Forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education.

There's a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero: he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'Nam, the hurricane, and the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm.

A note to those who saw Zumeckis' first great film, Back to the Future. Do not expect more of that. 'Future' was a comedy with drama added, Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene.

I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, Forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific: such events as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in ""that fruit company"" make for some historically accurate humour, one of Gump's greatest strengths.

One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question ""if he's smart"". This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.

This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn't see it at first. The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin' President JFK? The effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. I still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen.

On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a ""tonic of the weary in spirit"". That's the perfect description. Forrest Gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt. In a decade remembered for its cultural violence (Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Pulp Fiction) Forrest Gump is a beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs. 9.1/10",9

29 August 2001,The best film of 1994.,"Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump.A simpleminded mentally handicapped man who had accompished alot in life.He spends the entire time in the film talking to strangers about his life in which we see these events unfold as he tells these stories.In his entire lifetime he has conquered his disability,taught Elvis Presley to swerve his hips,Met John F.Kennedy and Richard Nixon,fought in the Vietnam War and has become a celebrity.Forrest Gump is just a simple man and what makes him a great person is that he isn't affected by any of this.he just lives life to the fullest.Tom Hanks won his second academy award for best actor for this film and was the first since Spencer Tracy to win a consecutive oscar.A strong supporting cast along with Gary Sinise,Robin Wright(Now known as Robin Wright Penn)and Sally Field Give the film great support under Robert Zemeckesis' superb direction.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the films that I really enjoyed.

16 October 2020,A life in a movie,"History, War, love, music, dance, hope, despair, triumph, heartbreak, romance, friendship, failures, business, success you name it and this movie encompasses it brilliantly. I can't understand how some people can actually dislike it, maybe they just don't like life because this isn't a movie, it's life. Tom Hanks' character has almost one hundred percent screentime in the movie and you never feel for a moment you're not watching Forrest. It's almost as if you're with him throughout his life.

It is a must watch for anybody and everybody.

17 March 2020,"Brave run, to reach the other side","""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

3 May 2002,The history of the USA is shapped by forrest gump...,"*~-S P O I L E R-~*

A briliant brilliant movie, about a kid, in which his IQ is 75, making him different. and from the beginning of the movie, even before the story begins, you see thet forrest is the great great grandchild of admiral forrest, the man who created the KKK's. And from giving Elvis Presly the unique ""leg-shakin'"" move, in his video ""I ain't nothing but a hound dog"". and from there on, he is appearing with great presidents (I don't know how they did this! these are the real presidents!), and making diffrance, even if it's the biggest thing, like saving souls in the viatnam war, and setting the record of running two years in a row, or by inventing the ""SMILEY"" ;) :) :( or inventing the sticker ""S*** happens"", the world will never be the same once youve seen it through the eyes, of forrest gump... And the famous saying, that life is like a box of chocolate, is true. you can really never guess what comes later, and later. every thing they say matters. so, if you'r gonna watch it, watch twice, or three times. if you can, in a row. it will explain lots'a things.",10

6 September 2015,"Forrest, Forrest Gump.. The greatest.","There is an unfortunate time when you watch this film, its not the film thats the problem its my highly evident fear of the next few films I watch just seeming so bad. For simply not being this. Its everything. Its a romantic-comedy-tragedy-life-story-historical-personal- uplifting-war story. Every time I watch it I go on an emotional journey with the characters that are quickly built up in the world around Forrest. There is not much more I can say about this film that will say how much i like it, apart from award it the accolade that is; My favourite film. Over time the film stands up, the performances seem to get better knowing how Hanks has gone on to be a great actor. His supporting cast do a great job of making the world of the film feel believable.

3 March 2018,Life values in a movie,"Forrest Gump - This movie contains so much meaningful values to the audience. Director Robert Zemekis's movie after Back To The Future trilogy which is based on the first eleven chapters of the 1986 novel by Winston Groom before jumping to the conclusion of Bubba Gump Shrimp millionaire. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) maybe a Low IQ but one thing he proves to the world. That's anyone can love anybody. This is the movie that took top 5 Oscar Awards in Oscar Award 1995 which makes tougher competition for The Shawshank Redemption & Pulp Fiction which were released in 1994 too.

14 July 2018,Forrest Gump!,"Tom Hanks was superb you can't really differentiate him from the character of Forrest Gump. The story is unique and the direction was good. The movie's music wasn't helpful at all could have added more greatness to the scenes. The rhythm of the movie slowed at some parts and was quick at others but the only thing that bothers is that a character like Forrest after all of that could have been used better and had better situations and more effective and I really thought of it as a great performance by Hanks although I don't feel most of the scenes were the ones that could show us the character and make it way more epic but you will be taken by hank's performance which was the spine of the movie. His love Jenny I suppose wasn't that serious character that fits to guide him or help him and should have been another character that makes that great effect in his life. The telling of the story and camera movements were absolutely gorgeous and Robert Zemeckis did a great job in it along side with the scenario which reflected the characters so well.In the end a great movie! 8.5/10

16 March 2020,run for yourself,"Many people watched Forrest Gump, and they felt that it was an inspirational movie. People like Gump who didn't have anything in the beginning can succeed. In fact, the director's sigh of helplessness in life can be interpreted from this movie. Each step of A-Gump is adhering forward, but each step is not arranged by him, but a force in the meditation pushes him into such a situation.

27 May 2018,"The most beautiful, unusual love story","Did I cry at the theater with a friend while watching Forrest ? Yes, we did . Did we laugh loudly at him during the ping pong game? Yes , we did. Did we feel his pain and struggles as a child and when Jenny died later on ? Yes, we did. My friend and me are one of those many millions who know Forrest Gump line per line. This film is not exclusive to the ladies only as a chick flick for I also happen to know many men who love Forrest Gump as we do. We can put the blame to Tom Hanks' majestic acting , or to Robert Zemeckis for his out of this planet directing, or just because this is the most beautiful, unusual story of love we have seen of this caliber. A brilliant film that needs no further introduction as it shines like the sun in our universe with its honesty and simplicity.

20 May 2004,Definitely A Masterpiece -- Albeit I Have Mixed Feelings,"Alright, so, the movie was quite a touching story of a mentally disabled man telling his life story at a bus stop to whoever will sit next to him and listen. I guess, in a way, it goes to show that life can be full or surprises, in many ways.

But, the thing I don't think I liked very much about the movie was the way it seemed like Forest had nothing but blind luck all of his life. I mean, it was to the point of being comical. I only ""wish"" I had a life filled with the blind luck like Forest seemed to suffer from, as I am sure many other people do.

But -- one thing remains true -- and it was said many times thru the movie and has become an icon for all to remember the movie by --- life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

14 January 2007,"""Being an idiot is no box of chocolates"" (the original line from the novel)","A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the movie's values and message are clearly right wing: as many other reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!

I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie's right-wing allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness. As another commenter put it, ""this is a movie for people who voted for Reagan"" or for the Bushes. Overall, it's a remarkable document of Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.

So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp: the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going public largely shares these right-wing views.",1
2 January 2002,Patronising Rubbish,"This must be one of the most offensive movies ever made and I am truly appalled at the central theme, namely that being stupid makes you a better person. Everything about this film is patronising and overwrought. Can't believe that Tom Hanks (surely the most over-rated actor on the planet) won an Oscar for this pulp and if this was the best film of 1994 then god help us all.

Don't waste your money at the video store - rent something (anything) other than this garbage.

15 October 2020,"Worth Watching, Its Like a Biopic of a Free Flowing Soul.","The ideology of forrest gump is a kind of package, one have to inculcate in his or her life, like not to bother too much about the outcome of the efforts one puts in or hoping for the return for the investment of feelings to fetch you the successful outcome and instead give your best you could be it efforts or feelings you feel about your loved ones. The way he doesnt bother running after winning the rugby match, the way he doesnt bother letting go her girl throughout his life no matter how many times she couldnt restrict herself to him. Yes he might not be a smart man but he knows how to love for sure. Be it his mom, running, ping pong, his friend and his shrimping business and finally his girl breaking him into pieces which makes him run and be the wanderer of happiness or peace. Forrest Gump is certainly a must watch. The direction, the story even though its apparantly based on the book forrest gump, performance of tam hanks everything fell into place and its nearly 26 years from its release but still it has its soul which makes us own forrest gump in 2020 and it continues to be undying everytime to watch.

7 March 2003,"That was great, thank you!","I've seen this one eleven times. No, it is not my record: I've seen Scooby-Doo fourteen times. But this one was different because it really hit me deep at the very first viewing. And I cried every single time I saw it, which is very unusual of me. I also had a laugh and wondered at the images and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do in this crazy wonderful world. I'm just grateful for this film, for it did me good.

6 November 2002,A dynamic movie triumph,"There is so much to love about this dynamic movie and I think it very richly deserved every Academy Award that it won. It takes us on such an excellent trip through three decades of history and tells an extremely entertaining and inspiring story of how a simple minded man went on to accomplish so much. This is one movie that I never get tired of watching and is most definitely an all time favorite on my list.

8 May 2001,"Great Film, Horrible Message","I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'. Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie. On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character. Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.

For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion. Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips. Forest accidentally becomes a football star. Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman. (See a pattern?) Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship ¬ñ and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn) ¬ñ but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.

Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film. Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump ¬ñ he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments. Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks. Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience. I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well. Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does. Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time. Right?

In my opinion, no. `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie. Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes. Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson). For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway. Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing. In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded. Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish ¬ñ in fact, a few are downright noble ¬ñ I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing. It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.

`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level. But hey, I could be wrong. It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion. Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking. Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.",6
8 February 2021,Appreciation of life,"""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get"" This is one of the first lines spoken in the movie, in one of the first conversations with one of the many people Forrest talks to while he waits for the bus. (Which is also rare these days, with everybody looking at their phones in their own little bubble)

The expression is one of the first of many outstanding one liners. In my opinion it tells us that we shouldn't put our weight in the things we don't have, but instead appreciate what we already pocess. People go through life experiencing both bad and good things, some people more bad than good, but no matter what you are given you can do great things and accomplish what you set your mind to. It docent matter if you're born with a handicap, or with a low IQ or if your ""just"" bad at math. Everything is achievable if your just persistent, learn from the bad and cherish the good times.

Truly a must watch for anyone, 10/10.",10
5 September 2012,Life is so beautiful..,"Never wrote a review before but every time I watched Forrest Gump I got the urge to do it.. This time I couldn't resist it and here I am sharing a few lines with you folks :) FG is one of my favourite movies. I think that if I had to choose a word to described this movie that would be LIFE. Forrest shows me how simple, beautiful and basic life is and how easy is to miss it and let it pass you by. The movie is very detailed and keeps you hooked in until the end. Towards the end though it touches you, puts a knott in your throat and even squeezes some tears out of you. I am sure I have absolutely nothing new to add but I wanted to show and share my appreciation for this wonderful and brilliant movie. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ...

31 May 2005,Heartwarming? As if,"This is a truly patriotic movie, and guess what: not even half of America probably likes it. It's got a dunce as the protagonist, who, for sentimentality reasons talks slowly, he's got your typical, advice-giving all-American mother, references to the Vietnam war and America's greatness and, of course, an all to frequently appearing love story.

Yep, that's Forrest Gump.

Coincidentilly appearing in many historical times, never funny (maybe save the 'Watergate' incident) these soon tire. It's simply done too many times, and each occurrence is as crap as the last. Many people have stated this an 'entertaing, heartwarming tale'. Are you watching the same film, with references to paedophilia, incest, war violence, death, cancer and drug addiction, all through the eyes of a disabled person. Heartwarming?

Well, no. This film may have been entertaining were it not so sad. It's got many occasions where you could watch happily. But everything bad in the film you've seen at the times it could be entertaining stick with you. The incest, the paedophilia, the drug use, the attempted suicide. It sticks with you.

Bad things happen to often in this film, and it's justified by Gump's idiotic nature.

I'll give it a ** out of **** for few moments of entertainment and savour.",5

5 January 2001,Reactionary horse manure,"Politically, 'Forrest Gump' is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing, a deeply reactionary film that valorizes stupidity as akin to some sort of transcendental innocence. As embodied in the figure of the good-hearted simpleton, Forrest Gump (played by the ever-smarmy Tom Hanks), this movie encourages its audience to embrace quietism and noninvolvement as the best means to cope with modernity's horrors. Everyone involved with this monster should be ashamed of themselves. Ditto for the geniuses who showered this piece of dreck with honors. Worst irony of all: this awful film beat out the superb 'Shawshank Redemption' for Best Picture! Yikes!

31 July 2001,Forrest Gump is a winner,"Forrest Gump is a kind honest sweet movie with edges of real life sadness. Forrest takes us back to old days of movies when every other word did not have to be cursing,Forrest is a simple man making his way through an unsimple life,the entire cast was brilliant. A wonderful movie and well deserved an oscar. We will never see the likes of this kind of movie again. 9 out of 10

18 May 2002,The South's greatest hero since Huck Finn,"Some moral high grounders were up in arms over this film because of the depictions of sex, violence, drugs etc in it. Yes, the sleazy side of life features heavily in Forrest Gump but the film laughs at it. The film does not make out that there's anything admirable about sexual perversion, violence, heavy drinking or drug taking. Forrest always knows the right things to say and do and although he might not be too bright he is a better person than many of the people he encounters. He shuns the sleazy side of life (although in some ways he doesn't fully understand it) and this is symbolised in the scene when he pushes the hooker away when she tries to make love to him. Jenny poses for Playboy, plays the guitar naked in a perverts' club, takes drugs but Forrest is there for her as her gallant protector and moral guardian. Forrest is also only violent under extreme provocation such as in the scene with Wesley. Wesley sees Forrest in his army uniform and calls him a baby-killer but like many holier-than-thou pacifists Wesley is at heart a violent person who hits Jenny. Forrest duly lays into him and if this scene is violent it's no worse than the handsome hero in an old silent film giving the villain a good thrashing for what he's done to the heroine. Forrest is pleasant to everyone, be they people on the street or US Presidents. He speaks sadly about President Kennedy and John Lennon being shot. Also, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour not for killing or destroying the enemy in Vietnam but for saving the lives of other soldiers at great personal risk to himself. He is a decent guy who is successful in life and the film is not patronising to handicapped people as some people have said. The portrayal of the single parent family has also been criticised but frankly the message here is ""always be nice to your Momma"". It is a feel good movie and although life from the 60s to the 80s may not always have been great this film show it in a positive light. Some scenes remind you of Midnight Cowboy and I think this is intentional. However Midnight Cowboy was a downbeat movie made at the end of the cynical 60s. This is a pleasant upbeat film. It is incidentally very different from Winston Groom's book and I think it is better than the book. The only thing I would have changed about the film is that I wouldn't have had Jenny die at the end. To conclude, funny, heartwarming, original and brilliant.",
31 August 2001,"""The Lord will take care of the ignorant ones""","The bus stop. John Savage gets in and goes to Milos Forman's New York in his equally breathtaking HAIR.

With the farewell quote above (from his papa) which gives live to Forrest. Forrest Gump gets on the bus to go to school and way, WAY beyond. But of course, Forrest comes back, keeps on coming back. To us. He is not stupid, oh no, since he doesn't do a single act of stupidness all through the film. He is .. Forrest, or for that matter ... Perceval.

""What do you want to be when you grow up Forrest ?""

-""Aren't I going to be me ?""

Even without the amazing special effects (did the money went dry to have some proper rain effects outside Vietnam ?) which are truly incredible and good and opened up a new chapter in film-history (without this film the dead actor Oliver Reed could never have finished his role in Gladiator...), this epic is wonderful. Of course, when you get this film on DVD and run it for about 5 or 6 times Straight, you'll find ONE tiny flaw in the accent of incredible Tom Hanks.

Sure beforehand you wouldn't have noticed because of the moisture blocking sinuses and ears and hanging in y' eye-lashes.... 6 golden statues this film has won. Let's somehow give writer Winston Groom, who gave us this round the world trip back to Yoknapatawpha County his weight in gold.",8
19 March 2020,more sincere and strong feelings,"I still remember watching this movie in class, I was deeply touched by forrest gump's persistence, positive energy and his love for Jenny.I still think that it was forrest's love for Jenny that saved her time and time again. I wrote an article about it, but I can't find it now.The passage of time, the disappearance of words, more sincere and strong feelings.

6 January 2021,A Tom Hanks classic.,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

8 January 2015,he better run...after all them chocolates!!!,"ho did he ever manage to enlist in the Army? okay, okay...

we have some of the best movie making ever, in the first hour or so...then we veer off into 7 other movies.

the character has an IQ of 75 but his intellect does not account for his, shall we say, humanitarian IQ. are we supposed to wonder...is he such a moral, courageous man because he does not deal at all in adult social complexities and just reacts? is he a ""savant"", in that as ""dumb"" as he is, intellectually, he can accomplish things that ""average"" people cannot, simply because they *think* too much? I wondered if his running ability is half ""transferred"" skill (what he lacks in real brainpower he gains in braunpower?).

we are given not one porterhouse steak here but two...meaning, too much is too much. Like Fred Blassie once said, you see women wrestling two nites in a row, by the third?.....nah. should the Director/Writer simply presented the greatest human running machine in history > cannot possibly break a sweat, stopping his run only for food and nature calls? well, he is the world's greatest runner, a War Hero, a multi-million dollar entrepreneur...and he's got a hot hippie chick n the back burner, too! I think the creators referenced MARATHON MAN, BEING THERE, that DUSTIN Hoffman movie where he plays the ""counting"" marvel.

the two disc set does not include the deleted footage where Gump meets Jesus. :)",7
15 March 2005,Bring your puke bag,"This is one of the worse movies I've ever seen. An insult to one's intelligence. Unbelievable and just plain moronic, I could barely watch. Tom Hanks was stiff and gave his worse performance ever. The directing was dreadful. Only a five year old could come close to believing any of this could ever happen. All the money spent on a turkey like this is shameful. And to think that it was actually successful is mind boggling. I was embarrassed watching it. The producers and director involved should have been barred from the industry for five years. The script should have been thrown away on half a reading. To suggest that a retarded person could play football is completely ignorant.

9 February 2016,An amazing sweet story of a stupid man....,"Watched Forrest Gump .... It's beautiful. It's just amazing. A concept very few movies have successfully stood up to....

It's the story of a stupid person named Forrest Gump. But its not just a stupid comedy to be laughed at and forgotten. It makes you see the world through the eyes of the stupid completely innocent Forrest. You see death, the evils of war, corruption, jealousy, self righteousness, greed, wealth, frustration, success and the world. But you see all of it almost without reaction. Cause you see all of these through Gump's eyes, through the eyes of a stupid man child and his brain doesn't work like me and you, he is different.... That's what makes the movie so special....√É¬∞√Ö¬∏√ã¬ú√Ö  Talking about other stuff, they keep everything simple, no special effects nothing. Just plain old good music at the right time.... And I must say Tom Hanks just nailed it....

This is definitely a #mustWatch for people of every age group.... At you in love? I suggest you watch it with her. No it's not a romantic drama....",10
24 March 2020,Inspirational and educational films,"It's certainly an inspirational film, but I also think it's an educational film. Forrest Gump's intelligence quotient is simple, so his growth environment is very important. He needs people to guide him. Obviously, he is lucky. His mother and his girlfriend give him enough love, encourage him, support him, and let him distinguish good from evil in the process of his growth, which makes him successful.

3 January 2019,My favorite movie,"I learned three important things from this movie. Firstly, ""Difference is no difference"". That's truly true. What is wrong with difference? Everyone has each difference so that having differences in yourself is not different. Secondary, ""True love"". I could see true love from this movie. Even if you see your feelings to the one you love impossible love, continue to care. That love would come true trult someday. Finally, ""Continuing to challenge untill the end"". If you challenged something untill the end without giving up, your dream would come true though there would be a lot of walls you would face at. What I could see from this movie was ""Never give up"".

25 July 2012,"Shawshank Robbed, but this is Great","I'd say this is a 94/100 type movie, it sticks in my mind as something that don't forget easily.

Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film, as his portrayal of somebody who just isn't too bright is spot on. There are also several lines in this movie that are classics- in particular the ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" line.

I don't think it's a particularly deep film for the most part at first, because the story is quite simple. But simple stories can and are often times quite deep- take Aesop's fables for example.

It's a shame that in the back of my mind that I have to compare this to Shawshank, because that's my favorite movie and they both came out the same year.

25 June 2000,Tom Hanks and Amazing Special Effects,"""Forrest Gump"" dominated 1994. The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards. Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance). Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques. ""Forrest Gump"" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable. The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later. Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film. The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994. It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of ""Schindler's List"", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s. The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture. 5 stars out of 5.",
10 December 2019,"A legend, a classic, heartfelt good movie","Tom Hanks showed us in Forrest Gump what a fantastic actor he is, if anyone had any doubt. But the story, the other characters, and the directing, made this movie overall a heartfelt classic. This is one you can watch again and again and get new things out of it each time. How can you not feel for Gump, who struggles with issue, which really aren't even the issues that others see. We are drawn into him, his mom, his life path, and his desires.

18 October 2002,Stupid is... anyone who thinks this is a good film.,"Only saved from all-time worst status by a good soundtrack and Tom Hanks' best effort to turn a truly awful character into someone vaguely palatable.

This movie is an insult to the audience, its own subject matter and to anyone operating on something higher than basic brain stem function.

Oh, look at the funny retard - he's a moron but he has a simple wisdom that can redeem us all. Fortune cookies are sophisticated when compared to the message of this film. Ugh.

It is a sad commentary on the Academy's milquetoast voting standards that Gump is not the worst film to ever win a Best Picture award.

25 December 2010,entertaining but shallow,"Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and excellent special effects), but doesn't measure up to its epic pretensions. It would've benefited from sticking to comedy and eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clich√©s and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but they've become clich√©s themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible saint to be very interesting.

13 January 2023,A feel good film for those that take things at face value.,"I have to find 600 characters to write a review for this film, but I could make some observations in a few sentences. Firstly the film consists of various scenes, where Tom Hanks interacts with historical figures of the era. I was surprised that a scene with Rosa Parks wasn't included, as some of the story is set in Alabama.

Secondly, is the film intended to be one long advert, for a certain sports shoe company? The brand is heavily featured in the scenes where Forest took up running!

The film is not without merit, some of the performances are impressive. It is not a film, I would want to watch over and over again, It does tend to lapse into sentimentality on occasions.

23 January 2005,Wonderful Film,"When I first watched this film ten years ago it was a wonderful and captivating story and has still remained a favorite in my top ten list of movies. Forrest Gump (Hanks) is a man with a low I.Q. whose been involved in many historical events. While at a bus stop he tells numerous people about the story of his life starting from when he was a boy growing up in Alabama.Along the way he talks about meeting his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (Penn) , being a football player, a Vietnam war hero, a professional ping pong player and shrimp boat captain. But nothing compared to the love he had for Jenny who always managed to elude him over the years. Towards the end she tells him that he has a son Forrst Gump Jr.(Osment) and that she has a virus and doesn't have much time left. They get married and Jenny dies not too long after wards. Forrest Gump is one of the best dramatic films of all time Tom Hanks gave an academy award winning performance that captured the eyes of viewers everywhere. The rest of the cast Mykelti Williamson, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and Sally Field also did a phenomenal job

Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

11 April 2002,More corn than Kelloggs,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the best efforts of the actors, most of whom are very talented, the ridiculous and corny plot makes this a real chore to watch.

You get the feeling that the director was trying to make a modern ""Homer's Odyssey"", but ended up instead with ""Homer Simpson's Odyssey"" - sans laughs. This movie offers lowest common denominator entertainment: patronization to those with learning difficulties, a twisted view on history, naive jingoism, and a nauseatingly contrived ending.

When I first saw this movie I began wondering whether I was being too harsh on it. However, after talking to between fifteen and twenty other people, I've come to the conclusion that I was being quite fair. None of those I've spoken to liked this film.

If you like bubble-gum then you will probably like Forrest Gump. If however, you like movies with some semblance of intelligence or real entertainment you will probably be disappointed by this movie.",1
27 May 2016,Really good movie!,"We just watch this movie in school and I thought that this movie was so good! I have never seen so good movie as this is. This is not my favorite movie but I would like to put it one of the best movie of all time list. Tom Hanks was good actor and deserved his Oscar. The actress of Jenny was really good too and I would like to give her the Oscar too. If you want so see this movie then watch it! This movie gives me some chills and some power of the excellent movie. Robert Zemeckis is one of the greatest director I know. Haven't you seen it? Then buy it for your DVD or Blu-Ray. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!!

29 March 2020,"If this is not love, where is the true love?","""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart.

14 January 2000,"This movie deserves a nice comment, but not a summary.","The moment I saw that Tom Hanks made a movie called Forrest Gump, I knew it was about some person's life, as all movies whose names are the name of a person.

But there was something different about Forrest Gump... This shocked me a lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.

There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply spectacular.

This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.

It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).

Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out there just like Forrest Gump.

When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and best Movie awards.

This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this.",10
5 February 2019,Reactionary Nonsense,"Let me start with the aspects of the film I like. Hanks' performance is utterly believable and touching. He makes Forrest seem utterly believable and sympathetic in spite of the cognitive challenges the man faces. The emotional climax of the story-Forrest visiting a person's grave-is very moving and it gives the appearance of grace to the entire film. Likewise, Forrest the character is a unique take on an American life and at least on the basic level of nostalgia I can get beyond his story. Lt. Dan and Jenny, to a far lesser degree, are also good characters. Apart from that there isn't much to like about this film.

The main problem is the film has a cheap homespun conservatism to it that feels utterly banal and hateful to the social upheavals and yes progress of the 60's-70's. The film goes out of its way-literally at times-to mute liberal messages and its treatment of leftists (dysfunctional all according to the film) is off putting. It is not so much wrong as unbelievably disconnected to the history. Jenny's fate is especially cringe inducing in light of this aspect.

Technically the film hasn't aged well. The special effects to insert Forrest into archival footage doesn't really work anymore. The feather looks really fake at the beginning of the film as well. It is a little baffling that this beat out 4 great films at the Oscars.",5
14 January 2002,Could've Been,"This movie has several elements for success in the right place, and could have been a true classic. Ultimately, however, it is undermined by its own thinly-veiled moralizing and its whitewashing of social institutions and history. This confection has an inviting, sugary coating of the sweetness of love and the matters of the heart, but has at its center the preaching of the ""moral value"" of social conformity.

All of this trough the eyes of one of the best movie character of all time. It makes you feel the journey of Forrest Gump. And Tom Hanks acting is just... THE BEST ACTING PERFORMANCE IN HISTORY. Yes Tom Hanks is a genius actor and just the fact he played the role of Forrest Gump makes him one of the best actor ever. The movie has a lot of really funny moments that are timeless. This movie is extremly powerful in portraying what our lifes could be if we stopped masking our emotions and the good in us. It makes us rethink about the good we can do in life. Its definitly one of the best overall story of all time.

28 June 2022,"One of my favorite films, an experience you'll never forget. Long Live Forrest Gump.","One of the most entertaining, enjoyable, happy, sad, heartwarming experiences in the entire world. Forrest Gump is EASILY one of my favorite films of all time and (in my opinion) one of the best. It's clever in its storytelling, its humor, and its depiction of the time period is just amazing. This movie will never fail to make me feel the highest of emotions. All of life's lessons in one movie. This also has the best soundtrack of all time, and the score is incredible as well. I don't understand how you could not like this film just a little bit. I've seen some recent hate for this film, and I can't see where these people are coming from.

Many have stated that this film is ""propaganda"" and that the theme is ""do what you're told and you'll end up fine"". Screw EVERYONE who says this about this film. People like this look with the eyes of someone with no optimism whatsoever, with a poor, grumpy attitude who constantly thinks everyone is out to get them. They see with eyes that the world is a crappy place with no hope. And I can't lie, it is sometimes. So many things to worry about, so many things that go wrong. Climate change, world hunger, racism, all these terrible things in this world. Most people in the world are pessimistic about the future, but wouldn't it be nice to not worry? Wouldn't it be nice to always be optimistic and live your life to the fullest? This is how Forrest Gump lives. This is the perfect encapsulation of ""ignorance is bliss"". And it's beautiful.

Forrest Gump is one of my all time favorite characters. He is not smart at all, and at times is one of the luckiest people in existence, but he's kind, hopeful, a great friend, and never gives up. If only all people could be like Forrest. The ""do as you're told"" argument is stupid af, because all Forrest does the whole film is disobey the things people tell him. When they say he can't walk well, he runs. When they called him stupid, he went to college. When Lieutenant Dan tells him to leave him, he disobeys his orders and saves him. Meanwhile Jenny (who apparently doesn't do as she's told) runs from all her problems and spirals down into the awful world of drugs because of her own choices. And the idea that this is ""propaganda"" is nothing short of ludicrous. This film is very critical of America as a country, and people say it's a ""conservative fantasy of the American dream"". Are you kidding me? I'm a DEMOCRAT myself and I find this statement ignorant as can be.

This movie is such a joy to see bro. I can't believe rotten tomatoes has this below 75%. There's a reason it's top 15 on IMDb and one of the most beloved films of the 90s. It's too low rated on Letterboxd. Tom Hanks delivers one of the greatest performances of all time, glad he won best actor. Nobody else could've played Forrest Gump this perfectly. There's so much to take away from this film with its themes of friendship, love, persistence, loss, destiny, hope, god, and optimism. To see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump is a privilege to behold. I rewatched this in school with all my friends in my history class, and the people who'd never experienced this joy before absolutely loved it. Can't wait to show this movie to my children and/or friends/family who haven't seen it. This will stay in my top 10 for a long time.

It's also kind of ironic how my favorite best picture winner didn't even deserve it over The Shawshank Redemption. My god 1994 was STACKED.",10

27 June 2019,Clever Yet Missing It's Purpose,"The clever yet disappointing thing about Forrest Gump, is that it's an obvious fantasy story. A story in which characters and the situations they're put in cannot possibly be real. Yet the story is told and acted as if it's an actual biography of a socially inept individual's life, who is successful with below average thinking faculties. Never revealing it's pure fantasy!

28 July 2002,Don't waste your time with this stupid movie.,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an IQ of 75 and plays a role in many aspects of American history, everything from Elvis to Watergate to the smiley face to the integration of the University of Alabama. The message of the movie is that if you are stupid and you always do as you are told, then great things will just fall into your lap. The movie is beyond farfetched. The movie is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable. The basic premise of the movie is ludicrous. There is no way to make it work. This movie is a real insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Tom Hanks is totally obnoxious in this movie. I never liked him anyway.

The movie glorifies stupidity and treats us, the viewers, like we are stupid too. When Forrest's mother says Forrest is named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, we see a flashback of General Forrest. When Forrest talks about Lieutenant Dan's (Gary Sinise) family, we see flashbacks of Lieutenant Dan's relatives. I understand! You don't have to show me! The movie begins and ends with a feather drifting around, as if we are too stupid to get the message that Forrest drifts through his life aimlessly. I get the point! I don't need to see an actual feather!

The soundtrack is irritating. The songs keep breaking into the movie in a very annoying manner. And they are so literal-minded! When Forrest is running, we get `Running on Empty.' When Forrest goes home, we get `Sweet Home Alabama.' When Jenny (Robin Wright) walks out a door, we get `Don't You Love Her As She's Walking Out the Door.'

Forrest's mother (Sally Field) does something absolutely despicable to keep Forrest in a school for which he is clearly not qualified. Are we supposed to admire Mrs. Gump for her devotion to her son? I do NOT admire her!

The movie never even tries to explain how a person with an IQ of 75 somehow manages to graduate from high school and college and join the military. The movie expects us to simply accept this fact without question. And what happened to Jenny's sisters? The movie mentions them once and then conveniently forgets all about them.

The only good thing about this movie is Gary Sinise. He plays a believable character and gives a good performance.",1
8 April 2020,A Mind Refreshing Masterpiece,"Wondered throughout the movie. It is very inspiring & mind refreshing. Life is really beautiful.

Don't loss a moment thinking of other people's shit saying! Go, go, go & enjoy.... :-)

25 April 2022,Better now that I'm older.,"I was born in 1983. This movie came out in 1994. I really liked it back then. Had to fast forward some parts in the early movie(like the girls dorm). Nothing taken away to the story. I loved it back then. I've always been a Tom Hanks fan. I always will.

I watched this movie for the first time in over a decade. I love it even more.

I'm 38 now. It touches me even more. About friends(mostly). I've had a few friends that have lasted 20-30 years. The ones that are always there. Even if they're not always there, they are with you. I still talk to these friends regularly even though I have moved away and so have another of them.

This movie hit me in that department in my recent age.

This movie makes you laugh, there is action, and drama. Tom Hanks emotions in the end of the movie may bring tears to your eyes. This is why it was one of the greats. It moves at a good pace. Moves along Forrest Gumps life. Mostly people who grew up in the 50's would notice the cultural references. But as a person born in the 80's with a family that liked 60's music and culture, it worked well for me. This movie will still remind you, even if you were not born back then, that you will never forget your old friends. The ones that will always be with you. Those select few that are still there from childhood to adulthood. That is what I took out of this. That is why this movie hits hard. Forrest does have new(er) friends and that is still nice. At least he has somebody.",10
25 June 2014,One of the best romantic films made!,"I am not a big fan of the romance genre generally speaking because I get my romance in side-stories in other film types like sci-fi, action, adventure, fantasy etc. But when the movie is labeled ""romance"" as a main theme then I usually will not like it... most of the ""romance"" films are icky chick-flicks *ewe*! I usually need more to make the movie interesting. Forrest Gump is one of those rare romance films that I thoroughly enjoyed!

All I can say is ""Jenny, you fool! The right man for you has been there the whole time for you and you simply do not want to admit it! Sure, He isn't that smart yet he's smarter than all the men you have dated combined! Go back to Forrest!""

And that's all I've got to say about that!

9 May 2000,Celebration of Mediocrity,"Perhaps one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. I fear for a society that adores and embraces a movie without looking beyond the surface. This movie is, at its core, a celebration of mediocrity. Sort of like the current popularity of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" (which lets the average person feel smart because they can answer easy questions) this movie is designed to make the average person feel great about themselves for being nothing more than average, just like Forrest.

I agree with the comments that infer a fascist or totalitarian subtext to this movie. This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a ""success"" without trying. A satisfied public is easy to control, for better or for worse . . .

5 March 2014,One of the best movies ever,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

13 June 2018,"Well made, but overlong and ultimately boring.","This was an interesting trip through the eyes of an idiot, as he is referred to by most in the film. I loved the music during the particular events, as well. Yes, this was an excellent film and yes, Tom Hanks is brilliant. The film is ultimately a talkie, though, and I'm not into talkies. I also found the film overlong with possibly too much information crammed into it. The visual effects were very good, especially the war scenes. The film does teach us a few lessons, e.g. never to judge a person by appearance, and never going back on promises made, and probably also not to give up on your dreams.

10 April 2002,This is a special movie,"I always feel I am watching something magical when I watch ""Forest Gump"". It is more than Tom Hanks amazing performance. It is the script, the special effects, the supporting cast and the great movie score and music of the film. Maybe we need people like Forest Gump in the world. My only regret is that this movie came out the same year as another classic, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". That is my only regret- that ""Forest Gump"" took most of the major awards at the Academy Awards that year. Both deserved Best picture and both are gifts to the world of entertainment.

1 May 2022,This is a Great Movie,"This film may be quite a few years old now but it's still excellent. It's a feel good movie. I've seen it many times and I still enjoy it even after all these years.

It's well worth watching if you've not seen it, it's worth watching again even if you have seen it.
