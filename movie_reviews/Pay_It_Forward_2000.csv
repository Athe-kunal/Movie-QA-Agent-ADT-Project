15 June 2006,Broke my heart,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

12 November 2000,Life is pain,"Life is full of inconsistencies, and it is not without a sense of irony. There are people that have tried to make a difference in life and some of them have paid for it with their lives. Some that come to mind are Martin Luther King Jr, JFK, Gandhi and Terry Fox. It's not easy to change the world. It takes a lot of hard work and determination. And it doesn't happen overnight. But then you see a film like this and you begin to question that rationale. What if a concept like this really was implemented? What if every single person that had a favour bestowed upon them was asked to pay it forward? Is it possible that a Utopian world could be achieved? I doubt it, but it certainly would go a long way to making this condemned world a better place to live.

I don't think this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I don't think it is even the best film that I will see this year (although it will make my top ten ) but the idea behind it is what has me intrigued. Believe me when I tell you this. I don't think I have ever been as emotionally galvanized as I was in this film. There is a raw power, a truth that rings clear in Pay It Forward and if there was one film that I would want people to see this year, it would be this film. It is entertaining, it is superbly acted, and it the one true film, the one true idea that really could help make a positive and tangible difference in our society and our world.

In some circles this film has been criticized for laying on the fluff. It is too much like a soap opera. And that is so far from the truth. Let's recount the issues at hand and examine them. Kevin Spacey plays a burn victim because of child abuse. Helen Hunt plays a single mom that is having a hard time recovering from alcoholism and has a bad case of ""can't get her ex-husband"" out of her life and her bed. Haley Joel Osment plays a wise beyond his years son that had to grow up precociously because of his mother that suffers from the above. Every character in this film, including the bit players suffers from real problems. If people have a hard time understanding this then just go to an average suburban classroom in North America and arbitrarily pick out ten kids. Chances are you will find cases of alcoholism, child abuse, divorce and a plethora of issues that are not conducive to a healthy environment for a child. So this film is just mirroring life. That's all.

The performances by the three leads is nothing short of brilliant. Not as much can be said for the rest of the cast, but Spacey, Osment and Hunt all could be nominated this year when March comes. All three bring compassion and depth to the three scarred people that they portray. But especially intriguing is Osment. He doesn't need to say anything in order for you to understand him. It's a look, a twitch, a smile, a shiver. Anything he does helps us understand who he is and why he is that way. Osment is one true gifted actor and I really don't think he is going to fade away in the years to come like so many other child prodigies. This is the real deal. By following up Sixth Sense with a performance this real solidifies him as a true thespian.

If you have not seen this film for whatever reason, and its box office suggests most haven't, then do yourself a favour and take a chance on it. Not only will it do you good, it really might help change you in some ways. And as Osment says in the film, maybe we may all see in some way that, "" the world isn't really s**t.""

3 May 2004,Despite the shortcomings - well played and at times inspiring,"I remember leaving the cinema, feeling very much let down by the end of ""Pay it Forward"". Watching it recently on television I find myself far more forgiving since it's a movie with a sincere and important message, expressed with conviction. The quasi-religious ending probably will appeal to many, but from an artistic viewpoint, it seems unnecessary and not entirely suited to the tone of the film up to that point.

Kevin Spacey is effective as the suppressed, sensitive teacher, while Helen Hunt is terrific, despite the role being far too close for comfort with her ""As Good As It Gets"" character. But it's Hailey Joel Osment's wonderful portrayal that gives ""Pay It Forward"" much of its power. He simply is perfect for the part. (Good to see Angie Dickenson, braving it in the role of a homeless alcoholic).

At its best, this is a film which may just do the impossible: inspiring one to good deeds, without expectation of reward or remuneration. That alone is a substantial achievement.

10 June 2020,"Very inspiring movie, made me think about my life.","This movie was a surprise, I did not expect it to be good. It was a very good movie. Nice story, kept me engaged even though I am not into dramas and more into action movies. Acting was very good, the actor playing Trevor was amazing and also Kevin Spacey of course. Pacing was good, sometimes a bit slow.

The most important thing about the movie was the message, paying it forward could make the world a happier place, people including myself have a tendency to be selfish. Made me think about my life, time for change.

11 March 2009,"While not the most moving film I've seen, this is still a solid, thoughtful and well-performed film!","Pay It Forward is not as moving as a film like the Elephant Man and Fearless, but is still a solid and thoughtful account of a boy who wants to change the lives of those he loves.

The subject matter was well-realised, and that alone made it genuinely poignant. I have read some truly unfair reviews, that Pay It Forward is overly sentimental. No, it isn't. The ending was beautiful, and heart-rending too. When I saw this at school, I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I did oddly enough, but it is very fair to say the ending was very moving, and added to the irony that the young boy Trevor, was unable to change his alcoholic mother's life. The scene in the hospital was also really sad, as I had genuine respect for all the characters.

There were unfortunately two flaws with the film. First of all, the script at times was a bit weak, especially when the three protagonists were not the focus. The other flaw was that sometimes the film's structure felt a little confused, but that's just me. Mimi Leder's direction was slick and attentive, the two ingredients you need to make this sort of film work.

The performances of the three leads were what held this film together. A wonderfully restrained Kevin Spacey played the disfigured teacher, and the scene where we find out what happened to him was shocking to say the least. Helen Hunt matched him beautifully as the mother, who tries to block out her painful life(prostitution, domestic abuse, an alcoholic family member) with drink, much to the despair of her son, Trevor. The real star is Haley Joel Osment, possibly the most talented child actor on film, who perfectly conveyed the 11 year old boy who wants to make a difference. Who wouldn't? All in all, a thoughtful and insightful film, that is genuinely moving. It isn't the most moving film ever, but it is definitely underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8
30 June 2012,"An underrated, beautiful movie.","Pay It Forward is based on a plot that makes you think almost about everything -both while watching and after. There are elements that make you smile and cry, and the cast is very good at delivering the superb scenario. Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey surely do not disappoint and Haley Joel Osment performs perfect, giving everything one could expect from such a young actor. Jon Bon Jovi is the surprise among the cast and adds a nice flavor to an already delicious dish. From the beginning until the very end, the movie manages to touch somewhere deep in your heart, and although I did not the book it was based on, the plot makes a lot of sense in its entirety and shines with its originality. It does not come with numerous awards or an exceptionally high IMDb rating, but it really is a very good movie.

14 May 2008,A touching film in these uncertain times,"A film of surprising majesty mainly because of its sincerity to convey the tale of a young (American) high school student, touchingly and masterfully played by the then 12-year-old Haley Joel Osment, who, at the instigation of his new teacher's challenge to the class, comes up with a beautiful and simple plan to make a difference in the world, involving doing a good turn to not just one person but three, who then, in turn, return the gift themselves to three more people, thereby very quickly spreading goodness in both directions, in the giving and receiving, in the most unlikely places and ways. Warning: a tear-jerker!

16 May 2005,Unforgettable,"In our world helping other people is perhaps the most important we can do. Children are the ones who often teach us how to behave in certain unpleasant circumstances. It is not only a moving story but everybody who sees this film stops for a moment or more and think over the meaning of life. One of the best American films I have ever seen with lots of good actors. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt are wonderful. In secondary schools it should be a compulsory part of education. I am a teacher and when I want to talk about this topic I always choose this film and students find it a very good example, too. It has not got a happy ending like it often happens in life. It is not a stupid story, it gives us lots of extras. When I first watched it, at the end of the film I was full of emotions and just could not sleep for a while. To put it into a nutshell: Try it and pay attention to Pay it forward.

9 February 2002,Not for the stonehearted.,"Pay It Forward is a movie that is aimed at one particular audience. The kind of audience that expects to have their life changed as the minutes tick by.

And as a film that provides profound, poignant and tear-jerking moments, Pay It Forward will be perfect for this manner of audience. Unfortunately, harder, more expecting movie-goers will probably dismiss this movie as an oversentimental and perhaps unrealistic film.

The film is centred around Trevor (Hayley Joel-Osment). An 11 year old boy, living alone with his dysfunctional, on-off alcoholic mother Arlene (Helen Hunt). One day Trevor is set a homework assignment by his new Social Studies teacher, the mysterious, slightly disfigured Eugene (Kevin Spacey). Eugene sets the class a difficult task; to think of an idea that will change the world and put it into action. Et voila!! Pay It Forward is born.

Trevor is played with an endearing maturity and at times, unstable frustration by uber kid actor Osment. As an aspiring actor, I worry that an 11 year old boy can grab hold of such difficult roles and make them his, while I still strive to gain my Equity card!! What Osment promised in The Sixth Sense, he shows again here with a more difficult and emotionally charged role. Trevor is a boy not altogether happy with his life. He is lacking in a father figure, his Mother struggles to have any impact on him as she juggles two jobs to make ends meet, which leaves Trevor with nothing but his own intuition to drag him through life. For a child that can only be extatic and contented with HIS life, Osment does well to project such a fragile character on screen.

Eugene is a character made for Kevin Spacey (although all his roles seem perfect for him). Intelligent, compassionate, slightly bitter and at times unpredictable, Eugene is a man that we, as an audience cannot help but engage with. The dialogue written for Spacey is much better than other characters in the film, and he puts it to good use. Spacey is at his best when doing two things; calmly and charismatically attracting attention to himself (Ordinary Decent Criminal, Midnight In The Garden Of...), and when he bubbles just below the surface, inviting audiences in so that he can devastate you with a single revelation (Seven, Usual Suspects, Swimming With Sharks). And his revelation in this film (he relives how he came to get his horrific scars), is so vivid, so intricately and harrowingly retold that you cannot help but feel a tear well up in your eye.

Helen Hunt is fantastic as Arlene. Managing to achieve a look that bizarrely mixes trailer trash, run down alcoholic with vulnerable cuteness. She doesn't get the pick of the dialogue however, and the role aswell as the whole film would have been a whole lot worse off had Hunt not been on top form. You don't want her to be your Mother, but you really want to see her happy and for her to do a good job at being Trevors.

The film falls short in little details. Supporting characters do little to affect the story (Jay Mohr as an almost non-speaking narrator??) and the whole thing feels flat if Spacey is off screen too long. Good actors like Jim Caviezel go almost unnoticed and you can't help but feel that a few more juicy characters would help the story become a little more...cohesive.

The ending is a reinforcement of the atmosphere of the whole film. It is a sequence that heightens our emotion and should set the tears rolling.

In short, see this film for three things; Haley Joel-Osment, Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt. All three are fantastic, and it's obvious to see why so much Oscar gossip was being spread.

If you like heart warming films with a little bit of edge, then watch on. If you're expecting an original, exciting, twisty or philosophical film...watch it anyway, at least the three leads are good.",7
19 January 2010,""" Knowing the right thing is easy, doing the right thing is a bit harder ""","The world is a pretty awful place if one sees only the bad which is usually all around us. Occasionally when there is a disaster, people from all walks of life, suddenly forget who they are and step forward to help out and for a moment, the world becomes a place where all mankind can share in that one brief pause, called Humanity. This is one such film. It's called "" Pay it Forward. "" The name strikes an immediate note of confusion at first, until one thinks about it. Too often when someone does a good deed, most of us feel we should try and Pay it back. This is the original concept, except in the film a young student named Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) designed it so a person who receives a favor, is then told to pay it forwards to three other people. The idea first began as a school assignment given by his teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) and encouraged by the boy's mother Arlene. (Helen Hunt) It is not that often when such a simple idea can have such a profound effect and reminds the rest of us, that simplicity is the key to our basic nature. With two academy award winners in the forefront of this film, I fail to see how it was not nominated for an award of some magnitude. ****",7
8 October 2000,What movies are supposed to be,"Pay It Forward is a prime example of what films are supposed to do: make you laugh a little, cry a lot, and profoundly affect you in a way that keeps you thinking about the movie for weeks afterwards. I saw it at a special preview screening and was blown away. My friends and I sat through the entire credits because we were so taken by what we had seen. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the phenomonal Haley Joel Osment once again give performances worthy of Oscars. I only hope there isn't some ""retaliation"" of sorts because of their previous wins and nominations because they deserve it again this year. But the big winner here is director Mimi Leder who has moved from action films into great cinema. She demonstrates the fine tuned skills she showed while directing ER. As I sat there, one eye kept a close watch of the story while the other marveled at the beautiful direction of every scene. They have my vote for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress, and Screenplay. Awe-inspiring!!!!

11 October 2018,Genoristy is a wonderful thing,"One of the greatest films of our existence! What can you do for the world? A truly genuine social study assignment for eleven year olds to work towards & process at young ages. Pay It Forward is a great concept! I love the beauty of how it works; it's the honor system like a bubble passing on to another making the world better just a little. This movie has an awesome soundtrack, wise writing, enlightening vibes, & a great story that sucks you in making you more interested as it goes.

30 January 2007,More realistic than a pyramid money making scheme,"watched the movie over the weekend! And i really enjoyed the story. I haven't read the book but i think the idea deserves credit and well done on making it into a movie... greater potential to get people thinking even if it is just for 5minutes.

It reminded me of the pyramid get rich schemes that some people promote... only this had more substance and seemed more attainable than the selling life insurance to people!!! I came across a review that said the movie was over sentimental and perhaps unrealistic. For those that have lost faith in humanity and ability to do a good deed for someone you really don't know ... perhaps it is unrealistic. But living in a developing context means that we are faced with that opportunity all the time.

Irrespective, of linguistical, social, cultural or economic barriers we all have the capacity to recognise when the hand of support or help is extended... its tough to ignore! So for those of you that are extending/ receiving that hand .. Pay it forward!",8

29 December 2004,A very moving movie,"This is one of the most moving movies that I have seen in years. The performances are excellent by all the cast members and the emotional tie you develop with the characters is so amazing that you start to feel what they are feeling and go through their good and bad times. This movie is inspiring and heart driven. I really enjoyed this movie because of the well written story and smoothly moving plot of this movie. The movie does not leave you confused as to what is going on or why. That's why I gave this movie a 10, because it is excellent. The odd thing is about movies, the ones that aren't really that good get the awards, yet the really good ones never get one. I have really never understood that. This movie should have been given an award.

17 January 2013,"Don't pay it back, pay it forward","""If somebody does something for you, don't pay it back, pay it forward"". This is the quote that you can find on the front case. Trevor is a 7th grader who's teacher tells the class to come up with something that can change the world and then tells them to act on it.

Trevor, unlike all the other kids, takes this project serious. He calls his project Pay It Forward. In his plan you must simply help three people with something they can't do on there own. After that, each of those people have to go out and help three others, thus creating a multiplying chain.

This movie deals with many different emotions, and is not for the faint of heart. With a movie with a star class and a dark lesson on the faith on mankind, this movie will keep you up at night thinking. It'll hopefully motivate you to do something to try and change the world.

15 November 2001,"The kind of tearjerker which purports to ""change lives forever"", but rarely ever does","Melodramatic hogwash or inspirational story of love? Actually it's a bit of both. Good cast struggles through do-gooder drama heavy on speeches and meaningful silences and long, long looks into the camera. Pleasantly set in and around Las Vegas, Kevin Spacey plays a physically burned middle school teacher whose class assignment prompts overreaching student Haley Joel Osment to make a difference in the world. OK character-study has some strong and bright moments, some funny scenes, but suffers from frenetic direction and editing, and a finale that's a bogus piece of shameful boloney... And can we finally call a moratorium on children calling each other ""fag"" on the schoolyard? Yes, it's the ultimate put-down for the 7th-grade set, but I was really surprised a screenwriter like Leslie Dixon couldn't rise above this tired and ugly cliché to find some new trick in the book. It's one small example of how ""Pay It Forward"" wants to be something special, but just doesn't have the creative goods to pull it off. **1/2 from ****

20 July 2014,well made manipulative movie,"Chris Chandler (Jay Mohr) is a reporter whose car gets trashed during a police hostage crisis. Then he is surprised by a mysterious man who gives him his Jaguar. Four months earlier, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) see troubles in his school. His cocktail waitress single mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) has a tough time with alcohol. He's afraid of his abusive absent father. He is intrigued by his new disfigured social studies teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey). Mr. Simonet assigns the class to ""Think of an idea to change our world and put it into ACTION!"". This sets off a chain of good deeds that would get to Chris Chandler. The movie goes back and forth in time as Chris investigates the chain of events while Trevor is putting his idea into action. First Trevor tries to help homeless drug addicted Jerry (Jim Caviezel).

There is something childishly compelling about the movie. It's manipulative and plays on our best intentions. It doesn't make it a bad movie. It just makes it hard to fully embrace. It's definitely a deliberate tear jerker. Haley Joel Osment is one of the great Hollywood child stars. He shows that he has that compelling presence. He just has that face. The characters' personal lives are too melodramatic. Mostly it's fine but sometimes the dialog clanks. It is the basic idea that is so compelling. There is a horrible twist at the end. It's an unnecessary ending that one should probably ignore.",6

Well done and original drama about a grassroots movement inspired by education: new teacher and burn victim survivor Spacey (excellent as always) moves troubled seventh grade student (Osment, clearly not a fluke kid actor; he delivers a memorable performance) to pursue an extra-credit assignment: create an idea that will change the world. Osment's plan of a Good Samaritan act of charity to the third power sets a ripple effect throughout his community and apparently across California. Hunt as his alcoholic mom desperately trying to get her act together finds fate intervening in the unlikely romance with Spacey and her past (as well as his) the only pitfalls to happiness.

The trio make for an effective elixir in our jaded times manifest and displays their acting muscles flexing and chomping at the bit but falters in the closing moments of an other wise exemplery attempt in re-instilling the concept of mankind being humane. Based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel and written for the screen by Leslie Dixon, heart is felt throughout; mission accomplished. (Dir: Mimi Leder)",

7 August 2001,Just the Sort of Treacle I Wrote When I Was Eleven,"This was not a bad film; in fact, it was fairly well done, for what it was. Unfortunately, what it was was emotionally manipulative. Child abuse survivors, cute kids, recovering alcoholic mom working two jobs, this movie had it all. Above all, the director's vision was muddled. ""Life is sh*t,"" says Trevor (Osment); by the end of the film, we can see that life is not sh*t after all. Or is it? The dramatic twist at the end (I won't spoil it for you) seemed to revoke the entire message of the movie. It had no apparent purpose, other than to lead up to the buy-the-world-a-coke, faux-heartwarming finale. The movie was not a total wash, however, as the genuinely solid performances from everyone involved lifted it above the sappy little mess it could have been. Osment is a gifted actor who manages to be a scared, vulnerable kid, without resorting to overt cuteness; he has a wary toughness which makes his performances very believable. Although I am admittedly ambiguous about Helen Hunt, she did turn in a very strong, thoughtful performance in a role that could easily have been one-sided or overplayed. Final analyss: If you like sentimentality, ""Pay it Forward"" is worth the effort, but it falls far short of a classic.

8 August 2003,Excellent movie!,"Great acting by all! Loved Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey & Haley Joel Osment. Don't miss the wonderful scenes with James Caviezel also.

No, you probably won't like the ending but it is so much like real life. Our days are filled with the ups and downs of life. In love, there is always risk, but it is well worth the risk!

What if we all decided to ""PAY IT FORWARD""? A definite 10/10.

20 November 2021,Good movie ruined by the ending,"It's a good drama, with an interesting idea and great performances, specially from Osment, he's brilliant and adorable.

I just hated the ending, it was unnecessary and instead of adding to the story, it just ruined the experience and left me wishing they'd cut the movie 10 minutes before when they ended it.

Such a shame, I don't know if it's exactly like the ending in the book, but story wise, it's just unnecessary and stupid.

9 July 2001,Hey kids! Altruism can kill you!,"Your poor old Auntie Gremlin has seen some self-important movies in her day, but this one took the dang cake. Now, if you've read enough of my reviews and such in here, hopefully you'll know that I'm usually not a cynical person. This movie just *GOT* to me somehow. I simply could not like it.

I know it's going to be a long movie if it spends the first fifteen minutes or so establishing how miserable the characters are and it's supposed to be a ""feel-good"" movie. Maybe what that means is, when I'm having a bad day, I'm supposed to remember what the characters were put through here and feel better for myself?

""Pay it Forward"" gets three stars only because, I have to admit, it's got good intentions. I have to say, however, that any lessons a kid might learn from this movie would probably be negated by the outrageous ending. I won't give it away, but you should expect to be *really* angry about it.",3
8 September 2008,The most moving movie ever made,"This movie is hands down the most moving movie ever made! Not only that, but also, the storyline is very well written. Now although the book contains a better structure to the story, the movie's story structure is still amazing! Also, the acting is close to being flawless! I also think the reason why i liked this movie a lot is the fact that it is so realistic. The reasons and the actions in this that were made by the characters of the movie were so down to earth, nothing unrealistic!!! I wish that everyone who watches the movie gets something out of it, and that the movie doesn't only have an effect on you for the 5 minutes after it is over. This movie has the capability to change a lot of people's attitude. I wish that they reproduce it, in a newer better marketed version, since i think, it has such a strong message that everyone should hear!!!

2 March 2002,Best Movie I've Seen in Awhile.,"Pay it Forward is a great movie, one of the best I've seen in awhile. Spacey is great (as always) as Eugene and Hunt is also great as Arlene, with Haley Joel Osment equally as great. Very heart felt and moving film, about a kid who is affected by a teacher's homework assignment to come up with an idea to change the world. I would HIGHLY reccomend this movie, but I agree it's not for the stonehearted, or over serious movie goer. I think that is why I've heard a lot of people thought this movie was too unrealistic in that it's hard to actually picture everybody helping each other... what an idea. But this movie centers around the what if it could happen...

All in all, excellent story, excellent acting, excellent movie.

14 October 2007,Meticulously Calculated Melodrama Doesn't Work,"There are four types of bad Hollywood movies  those full of violence, blood, sex and unnecessary amount of swear words; those made by Quentin Tarantino; those that have an absolutely unnatural happy ending (with heroes kissing and walking together away into the sunset); and, finally, those that are very carefully designed to be sad, teary melodramas that simply have to make you cry. Paying It Forward is exactly the fifth type of a poorly made film. From the very beginning and up to the end of it, you clearly see how it was calculated and designed. You feel how the film crew was meticulously and precisely calculating the moment when we had to feel sad, when we had to cry, when we had to smile, and when we had to wipe our misty eyes and go for another Kleenex. Hey, men, the real films are not made like that. This sweetie, sugary-treacle monster of a melodrama is so naive false, pretentious and puffed-up that it never makes you cry. Instead, you really wipe your eyes and ask yourself all the time: Do I really see that? Or, am I just sleeping? See, all what Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey try to achieve looks so falsely and overblown. I didn't believe them when they discussed their heavy past, when Hunt's film husband, a drunkard, played by impossibly poor actor Jon Bon Jovi, appeared. But the worst part is that blue-eyed, angel-faced, innocently looking little boy, so young, sweet and smart that you immediately realize  such boys never exist. He is as if stepped from the pages of 19-century moralist books which described exactly that kind of godly and for some reason always dying at the end boys. Remember, Mark Twain mocked such pseudo literature long ago? So, this young boy is always full of deadly seriousness, grave moodiness and he is always about to cry. Right, all the women and sentimental men will surely cry when seeing him and wanting to adopt this sweet little candy floss angel. With only one problem in mind  that is all not real. I never believed them in all their hardships and joys. All the time, I felt that carefully though-over plan that the crew and actors followed. The last part of the long film was simply unbearable. That most unnatural death, that laughable procession of candle bearers (this was intended to force a final tear from us, but failed flatly as a totally false and pretentious fake) and the slow, silly final song were much too much. Such amount of saccharine was used maybe only in Titanic, but that film is simply beyond all borders of a good taste. I have to underline the idea that I am in full agreement with the film's main message about making good things to other and never expecting anything in return. I totally and wholly disagree with the shallow and childish way it was delivered to us. Sometimes, I feel our world is really that stupid and hopeless if we need to chew and swallow such terribly cooked syrup. The final suggestion? It's bad; it's very insincere, very floppy and it doesn't work. Once, when you start counting minutes thinking about the time left before the film ends, you understand that it is a flop. I started doing that after 20 minutes. Rating  1. Extremely poorly done syrupy ""family-view"" trinket. Watch this only if you want to see how all bad elements come together and ruin the whole thing. And the fact that this film was seriously considered for some Oscar only shows how naive and short-sighted many critics are if they think this trash may be regarded good.",1

8 June 2015,"The world can't change by itself, we must bring it.","After watching this film I just remembered the quote from 'Sullivan's Travels' which says 'film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known'. Indeed, cinema's for entertainment as well acts as a message deliverer. This was an inspirational movie, and everybody must see it. I know I'm a bit late to see it, better late than never, right? I'm really glad for having it at the right time because 15 years ago I did not have this blog to write about it.

OK, the name of the movie represents the theme of the story. No matter its a developed or developing country, society needs something like the idea this movie talks about. Carrying a good social message, the movie slightly lags behind the too much on the emotions, especially the end part. There won't be a problem if you like melodrama. Other than that, I feel the conclusion was smart and strong, a better solution which would appeal for certain group rather alternate finale.

The film was based on the novel of the same name, crafted by a fine director with the wonderful cast. Haley Joel Osment had a great career as a child-star, you should check some of his films if you love children's movies including this title on the top of that list. As a middle aged actor, Helen Hunt's one of the last best performances before turning into a senior artist. It's not a usual role for Kevin Spacey, but he nailed it with the good dialogues. Especially his talk about the topic 'child abuse' was a great thing from the movie. Overall, the actors get more credit for the first- class acts as the script demanded for their respective roles.

What did you ever do to change the world.

A movie about a man who achieved in science gets the Oscar, not that real man. A movie about a man escapes from the war prison camp and slavery gets the award, and again none of those real persons. But a movie with the original, intelligent, inspiring, specially designed for a movie was not even a contender of the Oscars. Of course, it was transformed from a book, though there are/were no real people behind these great characters, all are imagined/created for the book and the movie. I never understood the American Academy Awards.

By now you would know that I hate critics badly if you are a regular reader of my blog. Once again they failed to recognise how great the morality of the story is, rather they have concentrated to criticise the writing and the technical aspect of the film. Although, it was not a box office flop or earned beyond, but got a lot of praise from the families. It's a wonderful family drama, but still too far from being a masterpiece. Intelligent enough one to get motivated towards the social issues. Being practical in the real world is a concern as it is risky, depending on the situation and the person, just like this movie's ending. Rare to find a movie like this, you must check it out.

23 November 2005,Heartwarming drama with superior performances,"Even though I've never read the book, PAY IT FORWARD, in my opinion, is a heartwarming drama with superior performances. If you ask me, Thomas Newman's score was absolutely incredible. In addition, I thought that the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Kudos to involved for a job well done. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, or Haley Joel Osment, or you enjoyed Catherine Ryan Hyde's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. Go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

14 September 2016,"They say bring tissues, but odds are, you'll want to take it out on a punching bag instead.","It's been a long time since I'd seen ""Pay It Forward"" and the only thing I really remembered about it was the ending; which explains why I don't like this movie.

To its credit, the performances are good, which takes the edge off of such a ham-fisted script. I couldn't believe some of the dialogue, and after a while, you just want to punch these condescending characters right in the mouth. This movie's all about the syrupy message, but it doesn't go about it with rounded characters and decent writing; it works the heart strings, and when there's no subtlety in that, it's just concentrated Oscar bait. Even a major death scene is played for maximum melodrama. I don't want to give away spoilers, but as a character is stabbed, he/she falls to the ground while staring up in shock at the heavens. There's just nothing natural about this.

""Pay It Forward"" makes me think of ""Crash"" for those very reasons. And even though this isn't as bad, it reeks of shrewd manipulation. Honestly, it'd just be harmless tripe, were it not for that ending. But as it stands, ""Field of Dreams"" is owed an apology.

Full of leftist swill, and the modern Democrat-left constituency, in hierarchy: trial lawyers, media acolytes, unionized teachers, working class folks, and the ""disadvantaged"": minorities, drunks and drug addicts. All are morally equivalent, there can be no moral judgements in Hollywood.

All pyramid schemes are eventually extinguished...here the origin is ""killed"".

The question is, how did you react when all of this was pitched to you? Did you forward it to other potential moviegoers, or did you say no deal, and walk away?

12 April 2015,Bullies you into feeling the feelers,"It's impossible not to get emotionally manipulated by ""Pay It Forward"" because the film hits nearly every dramatic stereotype and is manufactured in a way that basically forces you to get sad at least for a little bit. The movie is about a sweet young man, so pure and innocent that when his social-studies teacher gives him an assignment to make the world a better place, he comes up with a model that he believes will change everything. Trevor (Haley Joel Osment) proposes to create a movement of ""paying it forward"". You do one favor for a complete stranger and instruct them to do the same for three other people. If the project goes as planned, the amount of men, women and children whose lives are improved by random acts of kindness will be incalculable.

You name it and it's here: suicide, addiction to drugs, alcoholism, parental abandonment, bullying, martyrdom, poverty, children running away from home, spousal abuse and even a tiny sprinkle of sexual abuse too. If any of these subjects hit an emotional nerve, you will get at least partially sucked into the drama of the film, but it's impossible not to be. Not In a good way either, with character development and genuine intrigue in the lives of these people. This movie just comes in like a puppet master and forces you to feel the way you do. While it does have good intentions I found that the plot was so over-the-top that it felt phoney. Kevin Spacy, Hellen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment are all good, and if the film had been limited to the drama between these three characters it would have been a satisfying story. It's a shame that it didn't try to work on a smaller scale because then it could have been an inspirational tale. With the over-the-top ending it really feels like it's desperate to make you emotional and ultimately I found it more laughable than tear-jerking. (On DVD, October 31, 2012)",4
17 September 2001,I think we can do it,"It was a very good chance to see this movie today, just one week after the tragedy. I know some people don't agree with the idea of ""Pay It Forward"", but thinking about the word ""possible"", and people who simply have never had a chance to think about what they can do for the world they live in, this movie may do something good for us.

19 July 2010,A family drama with the most amazing plot,"It is one of the most touching films, I've ever seen. The idea in this movie is really great. Director Mimi Leder did a very good job to bring the whole dramatic nature of everyday life. In this film, I saw a simple but perfect way of acting globally. Helping other people in any way, this is the best way to do something useful globally. The cast is as good as the screenplay. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and finally, Haley Joel Osment - I think they fit their roles in the best way, it is possible. The end was best, not even disappointing. I see that every person, who even tries to do something extraordinary is never understood on time, but after his death. That's what happened with little Trevor. The reason, why I voted with 8 points is that something was wrong in the middle of the movie. I don't even know what exactly, but it really was. Anyway, this is one of the most rememberer film, I have seen.

17 January 2018,"A good, albeit idealistic and naive, idea, very badly executed","The idea - do good things for others and the world becomes a better place - was a nice one. A touch idealistic and naive, but sentiments to live by, at least.

However, everything else about the movie is ridiculously bad. The plot ends up very syrupy, manipulative and predictable. Cringeworthily trite.

The characters are quite difficult to like: the irritating, whiny yet do-gooder kid (played by Haley Joel Osment), the smug, aloof, pretentious teacher (played by Kevin Spacey). The mom, played by Helen Hunt, was about the only real and believable character in the movie.

The more you get into the movie, the more irritating it becomes. Having made its point early, it just seems to be marking time for the remainder of its two hours. Final straw was when the kid's father turned out to be Jon Bon Jovi... Seemed like he was only there for the audience reaction.

The ending just seemed silly too, and went a long way to contradicting the central theme.

Hard to like the performances, as the characters weren't that likeable. Helen Hunt was solid in her role (and looked pretty good too...). I guess Kevin Spacey did as he was directed for his performance, it was just the character was irritating. Same for Haley Joel Osment.",3

18 October 2000,TV Movie-like misfire,"The cast is excellent, but the characters are very, very thinly written; all we ever learn is more information about their pasts -- their personalities are set in cement from the first appearance.

The plot is, unfortunately, much like what one would see on television -- obvious, forced, contrived. Mimi Leder's direction is heavily manipulative, leaving nothing to the imagination. Scene after scene she makes sledge-hammer attempts to force emotional responses from the audience. The movie is moderately entertaining; with this cast, it could hardly be anything else. But it's a long, long way from what it could -- and should -- have been.

13 April 2007,Sappy story,"This one is perfect for fans of ""The Secret."" It's a sappy story about a kid who wants to change lives, including his teacher's.

Now, I like Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects) a whole lot, and I like Helen Hunt (especially with Mel Gibson or Jack Nicholson). I just don't like films that star kids. They are always sappy and this one even has Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) in it. Jesus with a drug habit? So, if you want cheap sentimentalism, horrible performances and worst of all, an excessively saccharine ending, then check it out. If you want the real story, then read the book.

Hey, I have an idea. Let's tell three people to not watch this film and have them tell three more and see if it will go away.

7 July 2018,Inspired Moments . . .,"Last week I reviewed a film called The Contender. The title would have been even more appropriate for this week's film Pay It Forward. In the 1954 Oscar-winning film On the Waterfront Marlon Brando has a great speech in which he says, ""I could've been a contender, instead of a bum, which is what I am."" I left Pay It Forward thinking a great deal about what it could have been.

The premise is engaging. Kevin Spacey plays a middle-school teacher who challenges his students to come up with a strategy for changing the world. One of his students, Trevor, comes up with the interesting idea that is the heart of the film. He says that we worry about paying people back when they do us a favor--maybe we should pay it forward. He decides that he will do something for three different people, instructing them each to do something positive for three other people instead of paying him back. If this exponential altruism catches on it might just change the world.

One of Trevor's not-so-random acts of kindness is to get his mother together with his teacher. Trevor is an only child living with an overworked alcoholic mother. His teacher is a single man with a badly scarred face. He knows that they would be good for each other and does everything he can to get them together.

There are, of course, complications. The primary weakness of the film is best described by quoting Richard Foster. Foster tells of a publisher who responded to a manuscript by saying ""this is original and creative . . . unfortunately the parts that are original are not creative, and the parts that are creative are not original."" Once we get past the engaging premise the film becomes a virtual compendium of cliches. We move back and forth between the chain of altruism and the budding romance but both plot lines are chock full of melodramatic machinations.

The sad thing is that with a little better writing this could have been an excellent film. The performances are outstanding. Kevin Spacey is excellent as always, Helen Hunt gives one of the best performances of her career, and Haley Joel Osment proves that he is, pound for pound, one of the best actors working.

I liked the film overall, but I really wanted to like it more than I did. In this season where we are drowning in the politics of self-interest, anything that encourages civility and compassion is a refreshing change. My expectations were so high that I left a bit disappointed. I am hoping that if I lower your expectations you might see it and like it more than you thought you would. It would please me greatly to do you that small favor. If it does work out that way, no need to thank me or pay me back, just pay it forward.",8
30 September 2015,"A ""movement"" worth applying into our own lives - ""Pay It Forward""","Rarely does a movie come along that attempts to become more than entertainment and hopes to inspire a ""movement"". This is one of those excellent examples of how real, positive changes to our world can come from film if done properly. ""Pay It Forward"" is exceptional from it's basic, boring inception from a simple middle-school extra-credit assignment until it's awe-inspiring, global-changing ending. If nothing else, it makes you think. And feel.

Director Mimi Leder orchestrated a classy, elegant, gritty and realistic journey through the Las Vegas underbelly and beyond. She masterfully tried giving us a message of triumph over the paralyzing reality of feeling insignificant in this sea of unloving, uninterested humanity on earth. Leslie Dixon's screen writing (based on a novel of the same name, written by Catherine Ryan Hyde) replaces fear and hatred with hope and kindness against overwhelming odds in a huge, indifferent world. It's a message for all-time.

The acting is excellent - headed by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and the exquisite Haley Joel Osment. This trio of actors put forth a special story about a sad but still idealistic 7th grader who believes the world can be a better place, even if his own worthless existence is as pathetic as everyone else's. He formulates a simple premise - Do something big and helpful for three people with no benefit to himself - and ask that person to do the same for three additional people, and so on... Getting proper guidance from two flawed but still hopeful adults, he discovers we can all make a positive difference in this world through small but not insignificant random acts of kindness that resonate over and over again. What he doesn't realize is the magnitude of his ""discovery"". Think ""The Butterfly Effect"" by acting out sheer kindness and thoughtfulness toward your neighbor when that neighbor needs you most. If this story can't get your heart and head moving toward finding ways to make small, significant, positive changes in your life and those around you, then you may never understand there is more to this world than our micromanaged little, selfish existences.

Surrounding the main trio of actors is a splendid array of character actors - Jim Caviezel, Angie Dickinson (in one of her last roles), Jon Bon Jovi, Jay Mohr... Watching downtrodden character after character receive a random act of kindness when it was most unexpected and needed, then passing that good deed onto the next ""at wits end"" character, all the while never knowing where those good deeds started or are headed in the end, makes this a fantastic idea. When Spacey's teacher character comments how after giving out the same ridiculous assignment to classroom after classroom year after year with little to no results, the ""Pay It Forward"" idea actually had a chance to change the world... It was an honest assessment of why we're all here together in the first place.

This movie mesmerized my family -- my teenage kids had never seen it and my wife and I had forgotten how special it was. We all discussed afterward how we could ""Pay It Forward"" and where. It doesn't matter who, what, when or how. What matters is the ""act now"". I'm thankful we watched it as a family. I'm thankful to see the wisdom and urgency in this message. And I hope all who watch will not only enjoy but apply the premise of this fabulous film. 9 out of 10 as a movie, 11 out of 10 for it's message and hope.",9
10 July 2002,SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER****don't read if you don't want to know what happens in the end!!!,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

31 May 2008,"Pole dancing, too much dirty talk","I did not watch it all. I bought ""Pay It Forward"" because I like the young actor Haley Joel Osment, who played in Second Hand Lion. He is a good actor with a lot of heart.Even in this movie he was good. In the beginning of the movie the mother works in bar as a waitress where there is pole dancing. Her clothes are skimpy and they want you to feel sorry that she is a single mom trying to make it with her kid. Yet this kid is home alone in bed late at night with no mother. She is so stressed when she gets off work, (I say that sarcastically) that she has to have her liquor that she hides in different places in her garage. The premise of the movie may be honorable to help change the world and make it better but the use of dirty words as a game between adults, pole dancing women and more made me just stop watching. I don't need to be offended with more than I can bare.

22 August 2006,The Ponzi Scheme of Kindness,"Movies, especially modern ones, love to show how life is interrelated no matter how untrue this is in reality. Maybe it is true, to some extent, but in Pay It Forward, the interrelatedness of life means that altruism is in all of our best interests.

Pay It Forward chronicles the life of a young boy, Trevor, and his mother (Hunt). Trevor is able to come up with a phenomenal way of solving the world's problems, assuming that he can get people to do it. The tale unfolds as a sob-story of sorts, and rapidly digresses into a personal story of domestic issues.

On the whole, the ideas are interesting. The movie itself is nothing spectacular  the cinematography is so-so, and arguably it's a vignette of someone's life, aside from the fact that it is based on a novel. It is particularly great that for once a child is the smart, sagacious character of a story. Hollywood tends to have portray children as naggy and misbehaved creatures of almost another species.

The acting is top notch  Spacey plays an oddball teacher who has a great ideal for his class, and Hunt plays a troubled mother who has all the good intentions. All in all, I think that you need a lot of patience to watch this movie. There are quite a bit of troubling scenes and you have to grit your teeth through them. It will probably make you a better movie watcher, though.

RATING: 8/10

31 March 2001,Corny and stupid. Pathetic!,"Terrible. The whole movie is completely predictable and Helen Hunt just does not fit on that role, especially after making What Women Want. The whole movie is just a bunch of sentimental nonsense which makes you want to throw up. Very slow and corny, and I also think it contradicts itself at the end. The ending doesn't fit within the story. It is way too in the extreme, which makes the corny, sentimental and ridiculous movie, even more stupid.

I personally thought that Haley Joel Osment was a terrific actor, till I saw him in this movie. His character has nothing different from the one in Sixth Sense. He portrays a lonely, conflicted child who lives with his mother, who by the way is single and suffering (what a surprise), and guess what, she's also an alcoholic. (Not much of Helen Hunt). Osment also plays the role of the insignificant little boy who saves the world with his ""Pay it forward"" idea. Very ridiculous. And you´ll see him again, crying, begging for help, being Mr. Wise guy and showing all his dramatizing techniques. No wonder he was not chosen to play Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace, he cannot play roles that do not involve crying and exaggerating.

Do not waste your 8 bucks. Watch something else. This is definitely not a recommendable movie. Worst pick of the year for me.",1

21 July 2019,Tripping With Goodness!,"A young boy Trevor, begins his 7th grade with a social studies assignment. And that changes his and many lives later.

Trevor lives with his alcoholic Mom. Yet, a child wiser beyond his age. His father walks in and out of the house, at anytime. And that is when his social studies teacher in school walks in with an assignment, that urges each student to do something that would change or affect the world. Trevor chooses to do one good thing to one person, who inturn pays it forward to three others.

Though Trevor thinks he has failed, yet he has no idea how his assignment creates ripple affect and changes and saves lives of people who has no idea where it all began from.

This movie without preaching will leave you a better person. Don't forget to cry your heart out. For once a while it's important to cleanse our soul. This small movie, will do that for you. Go for it.",8
11 April 2008,Yes....But!,"I don't want it to sound like I didn't like the movie. But there is something rather unsatisfying about it. I don't know if its Kevin Spacey's broad character, the whole movement that develops (I just don't buy it; call me cynical), or just that things play out so simply. I grew up in kind of a tight situation with a lot of strained relationships and unsavory people passing through. It just isn't simple. I would have like a little more subtlety. I'm also getting a little tired of the person who is in pain and would rather give up his or her life than just tell someone what they are feeling. I know it makes them vulnerable, but consider the alternative. If you have strong figure like the Spacey's teacher, who confronts the difficulties of a junior teacher (which I have been for over 30 years), it seems he would have enough character to put it out there. Of course, without all the misunderstandings and insensitivity, there wouldn't be a movie. It just didn't hold true for me. I think a better script with a little more reality would have helped.

8 May 2001,"two-and-a-half for acting, one-half for the vehicle","This is an astonishingly awful movie, given the level of the three main performances, by Spacey, Hunt and Osment. Even worse than the melange of plotlines, the determination to work in at least one ""effective"" moment from every known genre of film, from ""Meet John Doe"" to ""The Parent Trap"" to ""Dead Poets Society"" to ""Grand Canyon"" (and that's only a sampling), is the film's unctuous air of self-congratulation, over an idea of numbing naivete -- a kind of pyramid-scheme for Samaritanism, in fact rather less virtue than one is required to practice if one subscribes to any of the world's major religions. We're supposed to be as kind as we can to everyone, right from the start, not wait till somebody does something nice for us, then dole out our awakened goodness to a shortlist of three selected recipients. Others who have dispraised ""Pay it Forward"" have softened their censure by speaking of its ""heart in the right place"" or its ""good intentions."" But as is betrayed by its hauling in of an audience-tested cliche from every successful movie it could think of, its only real intention was to make a pile of money (in which I believe it failed). The makers could have demonstrated commitment to their theme by handing out the price of admission to three deserving cases for every one who bought a ticket to see this dud. That didn't happen, either.",3

27 February 2011,This is a Movie you can learn something from,"Well i liked this movie so much that after rating many movies on IMDb, this is my first review. Well to be honest this type of movies must be watched and learned from instead of wasting time watching non-sense and teenage movies, which just makes you feel good and after a few days you wont even remember what the story was. It's incredible, touching, brilliant, and something humanity has lost...!!! I am still dreaming of a day where this movie inspires people and the idea of pay it forward will actually come to work. not only the story has a morale but the story is entertaining all the way through, on top of that being unpredictable. It's a kind of movie you'll watch it over and over again and it's gonna take a long time since you get bored repeating it many times.

25 November 2008,Great idea... horribly told story...,"The biggest problem with this story is the beginning and the end.

It starts off showing by demonstrating the results (so far) of one boy's efforts to change the world. What happens? A man with a good career and no umbrella is rescued from the rain by a man with a better career and a car. He's given the car! Not offered a ride. Just given a car. Where does this leave a thinking audience? It leaves us trying to rationalize how this string of good deeds has wound up at something so petty and simplex; it leaves us wondering why THIS is the deed chosen to show us the gravity of his efforts. Then the end, which I won't discuss in spoiler terms, is contrived and pretty much tacked on. It's tacked on because there is little-to-no narrative build up to it, and it doesn't actually offer anything in terms of relevant commentary on the rest of the story. It's put there so we find it ironic or tragic, yet, in reality and in narrative, it's simply one of those random things that happen. If a good deed, or one of his good-deed-dominoes, had led to that ending, then tragic it would have been.

So, five stars is for good intentions and lack of effort.",5
20 June 2017,Inspiring at some times,"Pay it forward is not really a good movie. The characters are unlikeable, the story is really clunky and some of the dialogue is awful. However, there are some inspiring and good scenes in this movie. And the meaning the movie is trying to show is great on paper, but is not really explored well in the movie. The love story in this movie feels very out of place and boring. If the movie had focused all the way on the pay it forward thing, it would have worked much better.

22 November 2001,Idealistic piffle....but still a good show,"This was one of those little heartstring pullers which appear plausible until one enters the human equation and then the whole house of cards falls. The writer would have the viewer believe that one can enter a compound of junkies, thieves, murderers, and assorted trash and leave intact. Welcome to the unreal world. They also would have one buy into the idea that people change over night after taking a sip of the milk of human kindness. A very good film but don't take it too seriously. Loved the ending, it was more in tune with the way things really work.

20 July 2023,Pay It Forward: Nice Idea - Disappointing Execution,"Hollywood is on display here, sadly, mostly in its shallow glory. This one starts off well but all too quickly dumbs itself down with a superficial veneer of emotional manipulation. Spacey and Hunt, while convincing, seem somewhat miss cast as a school teacher and single 'recovering' alcoholic mum - with her son playing cupid in classic sitcom-style 'seriousness'. While the movie-makers have good intentions in attempting to include some 'worthy' causes, they sadly end up not doing full justice to any of them.

In an attempt to add 'depth' to the often labored, clichéd situations, it feels as if the producers have tacked-on a tragic ending that stretches the running time beyond its welcome. Those looking for some sort of a message may find something pleasing or even inspiring, others may be left wading through the messy editing structure, and some heavy-handed plot devices. For a movie largely about kids, it's not a particularly good one for them to see.

28 May 2006,Extremely Wrong Message Within Context of Modern World,"It is very easy to get caught up into the emotional aspect this film inspires. It presents real people with real problems & it gives you all a good warm feeling with the message that everyone can make the world a little bit better by doing a little bit of good. In fact, this idea has inspired things like ""Make A Difference Day"" every year. There is part of where the problem is, because the message is too simplistic. The World is a whole lot more complex than one issue. People have to work together constantly every day to improve the world. By living as this movie would have you live, you take 1 good idea, make a difference, & then pass it on & your done. That is wrong, the idea should be that you strive to make a difference that is good every day, not one day. Another idea is that you don't fall into agendas which benefit certain people. In my world, I try to be positive & make a difference every day. This idea & film for all it's warm fuzzy message misses that this is how you should live your live. In fact it insults & manipulates it's audience by using tragedy on it's audience like hitting a fly with a swatter. Tragedy is not what making a pay it forward should be about. Simple solutions & one time fixes are not an answer for life. Life is something you have to work at & work hard. This film doesn't present this concept correctly at all, & this apolitically aggrandized Make A Difference Day while it does do good, promotes a mentality that 1 day a year is enough. Sorry, but this movie & concept are wrong. Pay It Forward is something that needs to be done every day. Making a Difference needs to happen every day. Happiness needs to be part of the equation too. Tragedy should not always accompany this concept. The world needs to be a team, together. The solution in this concept is way to individual. Working together is the only way we will survive.",2
21 April 2003,Preachy and Annoying,"Haley Joel Osment, straight from his award-winning role in ""The Sixth Sense"", plays Trevor, the only child of an alcoholic Las Vegas waitress, played by Helen Hunt. But she has a heart of gold, and really cares about her son. And he cares about her too. Trevor also has a caring teacher, Mr. Simonet, played by Kevin Spacey, who gives Trevor's class an assignment 'to do something that will change the world'. Young Trevor designs a plan for good-deed doing that is tailor made for the southern California/Vegas milieu. In Trevor's plan, he will do three selfless good deeds with only one string attached. The recipients must perform three good deeds in return, paying the good deed forward as opposed to paying it back. This is unlike the world's major religions where believers are expected to perform good works all the time, but this is Hollywood and time is at a premium. Three will have to do.

What is astounding is that the people behind ""Pay It Forward"" have obviously bought into the story's message and the movie becomes a ""Touched By an Angel"" for atheists. Completely predictable, the story telegraphs its punches from a mile away. Not even the star-studded cast can rise above it's shallow preachiness.",4
28 July 2003,How difficult is to be altruist,"To do good for others is not so easy and this is well shown in this film. Children are not spoiled persons and their thoughts or dreams are usually the best, particularly when they are small. Good values of the society help to develop good children in good adult persons, when these values are absent, i.e. egoism prevailing, then nothing can be achieved. I like this film very much although excellent actor Kevin Spacey was too nasty to look at him this time, moreover when he was together with the always attractive and sexy Helen Hunt, but without this aesthetic aspect, from the ethical point of view, this is a very nice material, good to be shown to other children and parents. It is not necessary to describe the plot this time, it is enough to say that the film is worth to be seen by large audience of the society.

17 December 2000,Shockingly badq,"If you're ever short of a definition for the word mediocre, this'll clear it up for you. Appalling sub-movie of the week bilge. Kevin Spacey reveals the soft fleshy ham that lies beneath his technique, Helen Hunt relies on eyeliner to turn her into a recovering alcoholic. Dreadful script ellipses through awkward questions, director looks for pretty shots to endow hollow profundity, inappropriate production design (mm - she has to have the largest, cleanest, most well-designed trailer I've ever seen...) leads all in all to horribly overworked tv movie of the week. I paid money to see this and feel seriously robbed. All involved should feel deeply ashamed. Was it for the money guys, or did you really think emoting is the same as acting? Shame on you.

30 October 2000,Manipulative dreck.,"Cloying, dishonest manipulation of the emotions for those who need to have ""feeling"" queued up and spoon-fed. An assembly line movie that has no heart or soul at the center. Watch a real movie that demands your involvement - say ""Ratcatcher.""

8 February 2001,Pay it back,"One of the worst films of the year. It's a good movie trapped in a mediocre one. Completely overwrought with characters that go beyond the norm of a cliche, ""Pay It Forward"" is nothing more than a waste of two hours with characters who pop in and pop out, each one more meaningless than the next. It's hard to believe that such an impressive cast would show up in such a trite film. There are more than enough plot holes to make this film edgeless. Kevin Spacey is Eugene Simonet, a physically scarred social studies teacher who inspires a particular 7th grader named Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) on the basis of a different kind of extra credit assignment. The purpose of the assignment is to do a good deed for someone, something that is a little more than simple but a lot less than difficult. Trevor's idea is to change the world with a particular system of paying it forward where you do a good deed for three people and it branches out. His mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt) is an alcoholic working two jobs, one as a strip club waitress and the other as a cocktail waitress. One of Trevor's deeds is to pair Eugene with Arlene in hopes that they will have a relationship. Helen Hunt lays on the mascara as an alcoholic with a fairly odd wardrobe. It seems her entire face is craving for an oscar nomination which inevitably becomes a cliche. Kevin Spacey seems to be restricted to high school drama antics as an actor just experimenting with his character. Haley Joel Osment is fairly credible as Trevor but unfortunately, the film doesn't pick up. Things you expect in the film fall below par as characters in the film just disappear and aren't given a proper exit. Director Mimi Leder should just stick to films featuring nuclear bombs (The Peacemaker and Deep Impact respectively) because this one is a bomb itself. You know a film isn't going to be good when the audience snickers when they spot Jon Bon Jovi's name in the credits. The famed rocker makes a cameo appearance, and like Spacey, is restricted to being some kind of high school actor. He and Spacey seem like they're still in beginning rehearsals. It's pretty hard to believe that the cast (Angie Dickinson, Jim Caviezel, and Jay Mohr) all appear in the film. The character development in this film is so unbelievably thick that you begin to choke including a last minute addition to Spacey's character that had people giving it negative criticisms. Forget about the relationships between the characters because they're just so out of it. I don't know about the reviews that said it was ""manipulative"" but I will say it's crappy. Grade: C-",2
11 April 2004,Easy Paced Tear Jerker,"Having read the cover of the DVD before I purchased it, I was knew I was in for no real surprises, it is an easy paced (some might say slow) tear jerker. Kevin Spacey was terrific, Haley Joel Osment was good, Helen Hunt... well ... she acted to her abilities. I thought James Caviezel gave a great performance & it was a shame that the plot didn't allow him the scope to give the film an extra dimension. Mimi Leder keeps the film very low key, which in a way allows all the characters to develop through the film, but has the problem of slowing the pacing of the film. I suppose there is always a trade off! The ending was not surprising if you follow the plot development & illicited the emotional response that Leder was working to. I did find the closing scenes very reminisce of 'Field Of Dreams', hey but if it works, use it! This isn't a great film. but a good work never the less & if you are looking for a film of hope & redemption you won't be disappointed.

2 June 2001,Dumb adults/smart kid,"Greetings again from the darkness. As I always attempt to avoid purchasing a ticket to a Helen Hunt movie at the box office, I watched this on video at home. Actually one's living room is the perfect setting for what should have been a Made-For-TV movie by a fine TV director. The (usually) great Kevin Spacey walks through his role, but who can blame him? Working with Helen Hunt must squelch all creative juices from everyone on the set. She is just flat untalented and does not belong in Hollywood. Haley Joel Osment is the central character in the film, and seems to be about 110 IQ points above his closest competitors. Yes, the message is sweet ... it is just delivered in trainwreck fashion. The most interesting storyline is the homeless man that Osment helps out. This storyline just kind of fizzles out to prove that even the best of intentions don't always work out. I think director Mimi Leder proves that with this movie.

5 June 2001,"Two steps forward, one step back","Such promise, and such a premise. How ""Pay It Forward"" misses the mark is hard to pin down, but it just does.

That's not to say that Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment, batting .667 as a group recently against Oscar, don't give effective performances. In truth, much of the movie's emotional punch comes from the three spending so much time together in front of the camera. These three are phone-book actors -- they could tie our stomach in knots reciting all the M's in the Vegas white pages. The studio got its money's worth there.

The problem is resonance. Gifted as they are, the three can't pull the film far beyond the vortex of a mundane love story. The concept of paying it forward, or doing three big favors to pay for one done to you, is cheapened and diluted by three stars and a subplot that suffocates this ethic with ""Leaving Las Vegas"" overtones. More of Angie Dickinson as Hunt's mother and James Caviezel as Osment's payee-gone-wrong. Less of the marquee players. That would have paid it forward to the audience.

Against the backdrop created by director Mimi Leder, the ending is deus ex machina, a way of extricating a mired plot and blithely refocusing on what was given short shrift for the previous 110 minutes -- the idea that a world-changing idea is certain to have its pitfalls, like life itself, but that it's worth exploring to the utmost.

27 March 2019,"Jesus, can't belive that some kids really have internet. Ratings of 1,2,3 stars alot!","First of all, this movie cannot go lower that LETS BE MEGA CRITICS, 5 stars ... if you give a score lower that 5 stars, that means that your IQ is 10 so you are e vegetable! Now, lets procede...

First of all the movie is pretty old, 19 years old and still it is incredible and if you are not a vegetable you'll get the message. The idea of ""pay it forward"" isnt bad, i'd love to see this in real life, imagine how much good would be in this world if any of us will help 3 total strangers, and each of those strangers will help 3 more ... BUT real world sucks and people aswell.

The acting was good, nothing to complain, the story was very good as idea and well written and this movie as I said really teach us something.

Personal score: 8 / 10",8
28 May 2001,Fine performances...,"The film is worth seeing for Kevin Spacey's and Helen Hunt's performances. The story is compelling and nicely structured. I enjoyed the way it began at the end, flipped to the beginning and then slowly worked its way to the middle from both ends. However, the ending is a complete let down and isn't worthy of the preceding story.

16 May 2001,Could have been better.,"""Play it Forward"" is a thin no-brainer drama/love story which deals with the notion of doing good things for three people with the stipulation that they will do the same...sort of an upside-down pyramid sales scheme to make the world a better place. It's and old concept, especially in the days of Inet email chains, with a fresh face put on it in this film which tells of a boy who ""pays it forward"" as part of a school assignment; his mother and her stuttering relationship with her son's teacher; and a parallel story about a reporter seeking the origin of the ""pay if forward"" plan.

Overall the flick is a good shoot which viewers may find it a bit like a ""Big Mac"". It's good if your hungry but no matter how you cut it, it ain't steak.

3 March 2001,The best and worst movie that I have ever seen,"Before I saw this movie, I read an article in People magazine calling this an over dramatized piece of muck. I believe their saying was ""pay it no mind."" I knew that People magazine never liked any of the movies that they reviewed so I went to go see it anyway. I mean it did have Haley Joel Osment, Kevin Spacey, and Helen Hunt in it. And they are some of the best actors that I know of. But not even they could save this movie. I love the idea of paying it forward, and I love the actors in this movie. But the script was just horrible. Every single scene was milked to make it as sappy and over dramatized as possible. Haley Joel Osment is in it, so I knew that it would be one of those tear jerking movies, but this is ridiculous. Especially that scene with Spacey throws down his groceries and tells Hunt the how he got his burns. This is definitely one of those books that never should have been made into a movie. And then the just added fuel to the fire of hatred. Do yourself a favor and wait for it to come on cable.

25 August 2020,You'll Need a Box of Tissues!,"This movie is heartwarming and also heartwrenching. I loved it. I don't want to give away anything, other than it has to do with a young boy's class assignment. I swear, I used up a Box of tissues. It's a real fear jerker. If you're in need of a good 😢 or want a dramatic movie to watch, then this is the one. Settle down, relax and have yourself a good cry. I think it's probably one of the best stories.

11 May 2003,OK but too many false messages and attempts to gain sympathy,"This movie was pretty bad. It was about a young boy who receives a project from his teacher and he decides to use the chance to start a movement called ""pay it forward"", where one person goes and does three good things for three people and each of those people do three things for other people and so on. This was based on a book and the book's characters were African-American but they changed them to Caucasian for this film (I have no clue why). This was somewhat durogatory, as the one black character in the film was portrayed as a gangster/thug (he steals a radio and then pulls out a gun in the hospital after he is stabbed by his sister). It also portrayed every single homeless person as either a heroin addict or alcoholic, as Helen Hunt's mother in the film had a bottle of liquor in every scene. I am not denying that many people have substance abuse problems, but not all of them do. This film was sad at times but it was generally stupid. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.

Mimi Leader is so underrated !! She handles the film so gorgeous !!The film might not moved everyone on earth, but the important thing is true love never die ! Love in the world ! It moves me deeply almost every part of the movie. Thomas Newman is usually great in his art of scoring. I especially love the music of Possibility.It shows us how to give love to your side people and the society. It's a great educated movie ! It's great script of pay it forward. I have to thank Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt for their professional acting !!! They are so great in the movie. Haley is so great and cute. Don't miss it !!!!! Two Thumbs up !!!(8 out of 10)

5 May 2003,Pretentious ending spoils a good film,"The first 115 minutes of this picture are first rate, with excellent acting by Spacey and Haley Joel Osment, some solid writing, good photography, and an effective blend of humor, sadness, drama and mystery. The last part of the film is so pretentious and self-important, however, that it left me angry and questioning everything I had just seen. A good effort goes down in a sugary, quasi-religious Hollywood ending that steals its visuals from the Field of Dreams.

17 March 2007,Who Knew You Could Turn 'Human Interest' Into Bile,"I'll be honest; I was tempted to give this movie a 1/10, but I thought I'd be gracious because of Helen Hunt. She was alright considering her character was about as one dimensional and cliché as they come, thank you Hollywood... Directorially, this movie was one of the most amateur films to date. Its premise is unique, I'll grant them; the idea that one person could potentially change the world: however unrealistic it may be. The cast was dynamic with what they were given, so I make no jabs at the actors. The cinematography was following the trend of '00-04 for dramatic films; thankfully CRASH broke the iron bars on that one in the later part of '04. The stylistics and technique heaved ""Commericial Hollywood"" which, and I mean this with certainty, is NEVER a good thing for a human interest film. The idea is that it's supposed to be grounded in life, rooted in realism; not plastered with fantastic angles that destroy the tone of the film. More than anything it's the clichés that ruin the film. The alcoholic mother; the intelligent young boy screaming inside; the brilliant teacher who has a hurt perspective on the world and its people; and finally the thugly looking school boys who stab ""Trevor"" in the left side of this abdomen resulting in a William Shatner like death pose... Just as a side not, a stab that far left wouldn't damage the liver or stomach and probably wouldn't puncture any vital organs so that'd give him about 2 hours to live before help arrived, and knowing California and that it happened at a school, help would've arrived in about 6 minutes... Well, I could go on with the costumes, lighting and character development, but I'm not going to be ""one of those people"", well I probably already sound that way, and tell you what you should or shouldn't do. Between my critique and other people's comments or postings, you understand the film was not well received and I wouldn't waste a minute on it.",2

13 March 2012,Really heart -warming,"I don't think this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I don't think it is even the best film that I will see this year (although it will make my top ten ) but the idea behind it is what has me intrigued. Believe me when I tell you this. I don't think I have ever been as emotionally galvanized as I was in this film. There is a raw power, a truth that rings clear in Pay It Forward and if there was one film that I would want people to see this year, it would be this film. It is entertaining, it is superbly acted, and it the one true film, the one true idea that really could help make a positive and tangible difference in our society and our world.

In some circles this film has been criticized for laying on the fluff. It is too much like a soap opera. And that is so far from the truth. Let's recount the issues at hand and examine them. Kevin Spacey plays a burn victim because of child abuse. Helen Hunt plays a single mom that is having a hard time recovering from alcoholism and has a bad case of ""can't get her ex-husband"" out of her life and her bed. Haley Joel Osment plays a wise beyond his years son that had to grow up precociously because of his mother that suffers from the above. Every character in this film, including the bit players suffers from real problems. If people have a hard time understanding this then just go to an average suburban classroom in North America and arbitrarily pick out ten kids. Chances are you will find cases of alcoholism, child abuse, divorce and a plethora of issues that are not conducive to a healthy environment for a child. So this film is just mirroring life. That's all.

The performances by the three leads is nothing short of brilliant. Not as much can be said for the rest of the cast, but Spacey, Osment and Hunt all could be nominated this year when March comes. All three bring compassion and depth to the three scarred people that they portray. But especially intriguing is Osment. He doesn't need to say anything in order for you to understand him. It's a look, a twitch, a smile, a shiver. Anything he does helps us understand who he is and why he is that way. Osment is one true gifted actor and I really don't think he is going to fade away in the years to come like so many other child prodigies. This is the real deal. By following up Sixth Sense with a performance this real solidifies him as a true thespian.

If you have not seen this film for whatever reason, and its box office suggests most haven't, then do yourself a favour and take a chance on it. Not only will it do you good, it really might help change you in some ways. And as Osment says in the film, maybe we may all see in some way that, "" the world isn't really s**t.""",8
16 December 2015,Good Casting Pays Forward.,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

4 May 2004,Incredible!,"This is the best movie I have ever seen, it had everything and more to it! This will be ordered on my next sallery!

I love the acting, Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt are very good actors, and I can't stop being impressed by Haley Joel Osment.

The story is great, the moral is right, the editing is flawless. I lack words to express my feelings about this film!

I even fell a tear in the end, and that isn't often. If you missed it until now, see it!!!

26 August 2011,Idea and premise that tugs on the heartstrings but wish the direction could have been better,"This is a movie where it's premise and idea is wonderful but the direction of it all isn't all that great. This is a heartwarming and touching movie where you can't help but wish ideas like this would work in the real world. The acting is really good and believable and that is one of the aspects that drive this movie despite the kind idea that has heart to it. The movie just simply starts out really good but it starts to falter a bit by bit as it progresses. I personally thought if this was a family movie or a movie you can show in class it would have been better. The melodramatic parts just seemed forced as well sometimes. Although I liked how it shows how even adults can learn from children, if some of the flaws got fixed up it would have been a great movie. The ending is just abrupt and sort of terrible. I know they were trying to make the end have more of a impact, but c'mon. Overall this movie tugs on the heartstrings forced or not and is a movie that is worth a watch at least once.

12 April 2016,Forward Thinking,"Given an assignment to affect a major change in the world, an impressionable junior high student invents a favours system that sounds good in theory, but can it work in practice? While such a plot summary might make 'Pay It Forward' sound more interesting than it really is, there is no doubting the thought and intelligence of the proposed system: do three big favours for three individuals, who (instead of paying you back) pay a favour forward for three other people. Clever as this may sound, the filmmakers struggle to craft a solid narrative from the idea. While we see the flow-on effects of the system with random strangers doing favours for other strangers in a journalism side-plot, our young protagonist is simply interested in doing favours for those who he knows - which is hardly novel. He has a lonely mother, a sad teacher and a bully target friend, and there is nothing whimsical about his desire to help out these stock characters. By comparison, the best scenes occur in the side-plot as a lawyer gives away his new car and an elderly lady helps a thief evade the law; in fact, the best part comes in the first ten minutes as the reporter suspects a 'Strangers on a Train' trade will pop up before accepting the car. The film is sentimental to boot too with a weak ending that oddly borrows from 'Platoon'. And yet, despite all flaws, the film is engaging while it lasts. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt do well within the confines of their roles and Thomas Newman's enchanting score is superb. It is just a shame that such an interesting idea could not make for a more satisfying tale.",5

17 September 2001,Forward This Review!,"Your job is to read this review then forward it to 3 other people so they can decide if `Pay It Forward' is good enough for them to see it. Then they could forward it to 3 other people. Then, those 3 people could each forward it to three other people. Ok! I will stop sounding like a Wella Balsam commercial. Let me rewind and tell you what `Pay It Forward' is about. Trevor, a 5th grader, has a project assignment from his teacher. He must do `something' to make the world better. Trevor takes his assignment a little bit too seriously and does such charitable acts as providing habitat for a worthless man. Moreover, he has decided to help 2 other people also within his chain of goodness. Trevor will probably grow up to be the next president of Amway. Trevor also has an alcoholic mom who befriends the teacher. `Pay It Forward' stars Kevin Spacey as the teacher, Helen Hunt as the alcoholic mom, and Haley Joel Osment as Trevor. However, the performance I liked the best was Osments. I have a sixth sense that Haley will be nominated for some more oscars in his long acting future. `Pay It Forward' did have its endearing moments, but the ending of the film made me want to fast forward it. *** Average",7
19 February 2001,"Honestly, this is unforgivable.","First the good: Pay it Forward ends with Jane Siberry's beautiful ""Calling All Angels."" Then, the bad: I will never again be able to listen to ""Calling All Angels"" without thinking of this lamentable tripe. 21% of IMDb user have rated this a 10? What's the matter with you people? I stand by my 2 rating, and I think cinematic history will bear that out. Hopefully, this will soon be dismissed as an unfortunate dip in Kevin Spacey's acting career and a catalyst for the merciful end of Helen Hunt's. Contrived, maudlin, and fairly racist to boot (note that the only minorities here are a jive-talking black prisoner and a couple of young Latino gangsters). Mimi Edwards seems intent on inheiriting Joel Schumacher's crown as the least subtle, most exploitive director in Hollywood.

2 March 2001,not bad,"I enjoyed this film. It was a good drama with effective portrayals in the leads by Mr. Spacey, Mr. Osment, and Ms. Hunt.

When student Osment (I kept expecting him to say ""I see dead people"") gets an assignment from teacher Spacey, he sets out on a crusade to make a difference in the world by spreading random acts of kindness.

The ending might seem a bit cruel, but that's a minor jolt. This film will make a difference in your life.

22 January 2001,If you want to see something emotionally inspiring and can put up with the schmaltz,"This movie with Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and boy wonder (Sixth Sense) Haley Joel Osmet, will either inspire and uplift you, or will help you regurgitate your popcorn into the empty bag. The ""Pay it Forward"" idea is similar to the equally new-age ""random acts of kindness"" only it becomes a sort of chain-mail of good deeds. In the movie, a schoolboy develops it in response to a social studies project. At first, it doesn't seem to work but a reporter traces the chain back and proves its worth. Osmet's mother is played by Helen Hunt, an abused, alcoholic, go-go bar waitress who is desperately trying to make things work and get back on track. His teacher is played by Spacey, and suffers from a deformity caused by extensive burns. Perhaps because I'm not really a very cynical person at heart except in fun, I came out of the cinema inspired and emotionally energized. But someone else would come out painfully aware of the Hollywood-style manipulation in this film. Having read the plot summary, I expected fine acting (which you get) to rescue an abysmal story and make it a watchable ""weepie"". Instead, for all its string-pulling, I felt Pay it Forward said made its point in a thought-provoking and realistic way. One I'd recommend.",

8 December 2014,One Movie That Everybody Needs To See And Learn From.,"When Pay It Forward was released, my family watched it and they said how sad it was. I saw some parts, but not the whole thing. Years later in my junior high school class, my teacher showed the clips when Eugene (Spacey) gives the assignment and Trevor (Osment) says what he's going to do. Everybody in class was sent to do a random act of kindness to three people and tell them not to do it back, but to pay it forward to three others. This act, known as pay it forward, is what Trevor does in the movie. Difference is, he does hard things that he nearly fails at. Later I watched the whole movie and did more of the pay it forward movement. Aside from being a movie with grew acting by everybody, the message that it delivers with the random acts of kindness is something that people in the world need to see and do. It is a great way for peace and kindness to spread across the world. I'm not saying everybody will change or the whole world will change, but one little act of kindness can make the biggest difference.

Trevor McKinney is a lonely boy entering middle school who comes from a broken home: his parents are recovering alcoholics, hes' been abandoned by his father (Bon Jovi), and his mother works two jobs to make ends meet. On the first day of school, his social studies teacher (Spacey) gives his students and assignment to change the world. He gives the assignment every year to give kids inspiration, but Trevor sees it as the chance to better the world he does not like. Trying to do hard tasks, Trevor becomes frustrated and discouraged, unaware the movement is spreading across the country.

I honestly have no idea why this did not receive any acclaim. The ending sucked, I'll admit and the whole thing was emotionally manipulative, but look at other acclaimed movies that are worse. 12 Years A Slave had no plot and did not get anywhere. This has an actual story that people can learn from an convey its message. Sad or not, if more people watched this more and were as disciplined as Trevor, the whole world would be a better place.",8
20 October 2000,Spacey & Osment shine,"And the first half of this movie does as well. It is brilliant. Then the middle sags into hollywoodland and I lost my involvement with the movie so that the ending did not have the effect on me it was supposed to, judging by the sobs around me. Angie Dickinson in bag lady mode is a stretch. But the good points outweigh the bad. The setting of Las Vegas for a spiritual story is a stroke of brilliance, all the glare and false glitter as a setting for the jewel of hope within. Spacey inhabits every role so seamlessly, he never ceases to amaze me. Osment continues his excellent work in this also. Helen does her Helen as usual. She never lets me forget she's an actress in any of her work. I gave it an 8 out of 10 for a movie that is worth the price of admission. But, I was musing as I left the theatre, why do they never ever have a movie with a woman as the beast and a man as the beauty ? Would we have bought a handsome single Dad in this role in love with a horribly scarred woman ? Hmmmm.

23 January 2023,Impressive idea mired in downer delivery cliches,"The core concept of this film, ""young kid given open ended social studies assignment comes up with a great inspiring idea"" and the whole journalist tracking down the source of the movement that's spreading the nation were really really good ideas.

Then cos apparently we only like darkness they wrapped the whole thing in a substance abuse child abuse back story, and capped it off with a completely unnecessary dark ending, with a really unpleasant ""he died to save us"" type final scene that turned the whole thing into some kind of religious sermon you never signed up for thing.

The pluses were
the actors gave really good deliveries,
the scenery of suburban Las Vegas was nice and we don't usually see off the main drag.

17 October 2000,They should take Kevin Spacey's Oscar back!!!!,"Apparently some people love to see the same miserable story over and over again. Why must they try so hard to make the audience cry, and in doing so, compromise the story.

I thought the movie made Kevin Spacey (whom I love) look absolutely horrible! [watch for one of the worst lines in movie history ""I couldn't figure out why that water smelled so bad!""] Helen Hunt managed to play the same role she plays in every movie! The audience actually laughed out loud when Jon Bon Jovi's name appeared on the screen, and his menacing character as an abusive husband is just as laughable as his reputation.

Why the heck did Thomas Newman practically use the same score as he did with American Beauty? Can you say 'MARKETING?'

At the end, I expected one person to start clapping slowly and then another and then the whole crowd. It is that bad. I've seen half the scenes in other movies.

One scene actually is remarkably close to a scene in Oliver Stone's Platoon (believe it or not)!!!

In summation... DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!! PLEASE!!!

7 July 2017,Promising drama turned manipulative romance,"'Pay it Forward' is a solid, well-made drama with some impressive acting performances. It will satisfy a lot of people but I was a little disappointed with the direction the film took. The first half of the film sets up an interesting plot, then the second half focuses almost entirely on the developing romance between Trevor's mother and teacher and the actual story behind the film - a young boy attempting to make the world a better place - almost becomes a sub-plot.

The ending also felt like an easy way out for the filmmakers and a cheap attempt at manipulating the audience's emotions. It was a totally unnecessary ending to a film that started with a lot of promise but went downhill fast towards the end. There are certainly worse films out there than 'Pay it Forward', but I was disappointed with the direction this film took. It could have, and should have been a lot better.

21 December 2001,Decent flick,"I heard bad things about this movie, but there was nothing else on TV, so I decided to watch it. What I found was a decent tearjeraker. Haley Joel Osmont is great as Treveor as are Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt,my only problem with the film is the sappy ending, the tears I cried weren't earned they were forced.

29 May 2001,An emotional powerhouse of a motion picture! Why was it snubbed by the Oscars??,"When ""Pay it Forward"" first came out, people were suspecting Oscar buzz. Well, after it was released, its performance at the box office wasn't too good, the reviews were mixed and everyone I know was telling me that this movie was bad. Luckily, I still felt the urge to strut on down to the video store and check it out.

This is a truly magnificent film! Not only is it emotionally powerful, but it's inspiring and has one of the most terrific messages ever delivered in motion pictures. The idea of ""Pay it Forward"" is a quite noble, original and useful concept. It can actually be applied to the real world. Instead of paying back the person who has helped you through a sticky situation--though it would be nice to do so--just pass the torch to three others who are also in need of help. That way it keeps things moving, like a chain letter and this world can gradually become a better place. It's a hell of a lot better than sitting back, bitching and moaning about the world's problems when you're not doing a damn thing to help.

I'm sure a lot of the film's themes will hit home. Helen Hunt was excellent in a role much different from her usual typecasting. She plays an alcoholic mother/Vegas waitress, with a sort of trailer-trash attitude. But deep down inside she wants to better herself. I'm sure lots of audiences watching this film will be able to relate to her character--those who've grown up with either parent as an alcoholic. And the whole theme of her husband coming back to see her son, and ending up making things worse, I'm sure will also hit close to home.

Aside from Helen Hunt, the other actors were magnificent as well. Kevin Spacey delivers yet another magnificent, powerful performance as a burn victim who teaches the 7th grade. I like how the film never romanticizes his handicap, and at times you forget the burn marks on his face. Spacey deserved another nomination, and definitely deserved to win over Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator""! Jim Caviezel delivers a very touching performance as a homeless man/former substance abuser. Almost every time he appeared on screen, I burst out crying. Haley Joel Osment delivers a performance even more impressive than his breakout debut in ""The Sixth Sense."" I just felt this role required more subtlety, and would've been an impressive performance even if he were thirty years older. This role REALLY proves his knack for acting, and I'm sure he will grow up to win many Oscars. Let's just hope he doesn't become another Macaulay Culkin...LOL.

If the musical score sounds familiar, it was composed by Thomas Newman who also composed the incredible score for ""American Beauty."" If you notice, the music in this film has a rhythm synonymous to the music in ""AB."" And just like in Kevin Spacey's previous powerhouse motion picture, it perfectly fits the tone and accentuates the mood of each scene.

I can't say I was thrilled with Mimi Leder's past work. She's a fine director, but I think her previous efforts like ""Deep Impact"" and ""The Peacemaker"" were just not written very well. And she didn't have a lot to work with. The screenplay, this time around, is excellent and she had a lot to work with. And this time I will congratulate her for bringing such a brilliant motion picture to life.

""Pay it Forward"" is REAL drama. There's absolutely no melodrama, no cheap sentimentality. This is a great movie that makes you feel good at times, depressed at others (especially at the very end), but always touches your heart. It tries to display a positive outlook on life, yet at the same time showing us that some things can't be changed and we will never live in a utopian society.

If this movie doesn't touch your heart...I ask you to explore it more deeply. That's my way of paying it forward to you.

My score: 10 (out of 10)",10

30 October 2000,"Spacey, Hunt, Osment, Best Of The Year","Is it possible that altruism can exist in the world today? Can anyone really perform an altruistic act for another? Would anyone anywhere even be willing to consider such a thing, let alone actually try it? And what would happen if they did? It's the stuff of which great philosophies are made, and in this case, the stuff of great cinema. In `Pay It Forward,' directed by Mimi Leder and adapted from the novel by Catherine Ryan Hyde, the subject of altruism and it's possible effects is addressed through one of the most thought provoking, emotionally charged dramas of the year (or of any year, for that matter). It begins when a Las Vegas seventh grade Social Studies teacher, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), gives his class an assignment: Come up with an idea that could ultimately change the world. And implement it. It's a thoughtful exercise, used by an insightful teacher in an effort to get his students to think, to explore the possibilities of the mind, wherein, he tells them, anything is possible. And after many years of teaching, Simonet finally encounters a student, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), who actually comes up with a unique idea: Do something for someone else, something `hard.' But don't ask them to pay it back; instead, have them `pay it forward.' And do it for three people. Then those three do it for three others, and on and on. Simply put: What a concept. But can it work? Trevor thinks it can, and despite a number of personal obstacles he must overcome, he embarks upon his altruistic quest. This is a terrific, heart-wrenching story, written for the screen by Leslie Dixon (look for an Oscar nomination) and delivered to perfection by director Leder and a cast that is as good as it gets. Kevin Spacey turns in yet another astounding performance that may very well win him another Oscar. What an amazing actor; he brings Simonet to life with nuance and depth that most other actors can only dream of coming close to. The way he speaks and carries himself, his attention to detail; it all comes together to make Simonet a character you will not soon forget. And, as good as Spacey is, Helen Hunt (Arlene McKinney) proves his equal in a dynamic performance that could garner her another Oscar as well. Her portrayal of Trevor's alcoholic mother, a single mom with two jobs trying to keep her world together, is a soul-stirring, emotional triumph. She gives it everything and more; the vulnerability, the desperation, the pain. And the love. It's all there, and she makes you feel every bit of it with her. As Trevor, Osment does more than hold his own with Spacey and Hunt, turning in a special performance that makes Trevor a truly special, memorable character. There may just be another Oscar nomination in this for him, also. How exceptional it is to have three performances of this caliber in a single movie; what a tribute to the abilities of these three exceptional actors.

The supporting cast includes Jay Mohr (Chris Chandler), James Caviezel (Jerry), Angie Dickinson (Grace), and Jon Bon Jovi (Ricky). There should be an Oscar nomination awaiting Mimi Leder, as well, because what she has done with `Pay It Forward,' must not go unheralded. Certainly, she had a brilliant cast with which to work, but much of the credit for the emotional levels attained in this film must surely go to her. This film is not merely great, it is truly inspirational, with an ending that will leave your soul in tatters. I can't remember the last time the audience burst into spontaneous applause at the end of a movie, which is what happened when I saw this film. This is one gut-wrenching, emotional ride you absolutely must not miss. I rate this one 10/10.",10

28 March 2021,"Seemed simple and forgettable, but it wasn't","Are you interested in a quick paced movie, with a great idea as the foundation of a script and proper execution? If you want your strings to be tugged a bit, this movie might be for you. It's a low-to-the-ground production, where the ""drama"" and the characters are the driving force. The entire cast is good (you can't deny Spacey is a good actor.. considering), and the movie hits the intended emotional notes perfectly.

It's very humane and memorable. And more importantly, has a very good ending!

An easy recommendation if you are feeling up to it.

3 February 2002,Very Edifying and Original Film,"I just saw this film on DVD and have been reading a large number of the IMDB comments agains it. What a load of intellectual crap ! ( the comments, I mean, not the film ). I think this is an excellent film, the script is first rate, the actors excellent and the whole thing combines suspense laugher and a dose of tears! Critics who keep asking useless questions about the racial origin of one or other actors in the film or conversely who keep saying such and such an actor would do this or that or wouldn't react in such a way are just wasting their breath and haven't really understood what the film's about. The film is in no way a true to life documentary but examines the idea .........what if.....we all tried to help each other!. The result is both humoristic and edifying as we are treading on hitherto untrodden territory. True, the idea of ""doing good"" unilaterally has already been examined in such films as ""Magnificent Obsession"" starring Rock Hudson and more recently ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" starring Audrey Tautou but in this field, the film ""Pay it Forward"" was a cut above these. I admit I was very shocked and in tears at the end and I wasn't expecting the final outcome, but that's life! ( if I can express myself thus ) and the candle-light vigil could have been dispensed with but these are really minor reproaches about what to me is an excellent film and I would pay tribute to the excellent acting of all those involved. Highly recommendable and let's hope that will actually have the desired effect on a large number of people !!!",
30 October 2000,A great movie sullied into a merely good movie,"You've heard the plot by now--so let me say that this movie is a mix. It wonderfully portrays the difficulty of taking ordinary steps in our own ordinary lives. Things such as forgiving parents, friends, and relational partners, for example, seem so obvious from some perspectives. Such as the calm and detached motivations of hindsight, or a meditative state, or even a good movie. But when we are actually faced with the reality of letting the grievance or pain go, then we see how hard it is. This movie does show the extraordinary courage it takes, sometimes, to do the simple and humane things in our everyday lives that we KNOW will make our lives worth living. For this, ""Pay It Forward"" is a great exemplar.

However, the movie doesn't quite seem to believe in its own high premise. At least not fully. The plot also involves some standard Hollywood manipulations and machinations we've all seen a thousand times before, yet we NEVER see them in real life. because they aren't real. I can accept that movies, and any art, for that matter, get to display unrealistic conventions and events for effect. After all, if movies weren't somehow more than actual reality, then we wouldn't benefit from experiencing them. They'd be just like real life. Acknowledging that, I think this movie cops out. The distinct and predictable patterns of the two adults eying each other, then coming together and not coming together--etc., is an annoying distraction from the lofty and rather thrilling promise offered by the movie's unusual premise.

The ending-- god, what a load of crap! It's as if the movie makers lost all confidence in their own vision, and pasted this slick, fake, heart-poking ""device"" on at the end in one last, desperate attempt to redeem the flick. Truth is, if they'd stayed the course a bit longer, the movie they had envisioned in the first place could easily have won us over on its own merits. That is, this movie never needed saving. The somewhat spiritual tone of the original inception was a bold and creative stroke, but a likeable and workable one. The ""fixes,"" unnecessarily applied, only cluttered it up.

Overall, I'd say this is a great movie that has been sullied into a merely good movie. The fine cast deserved a lot better than that. I gave it a 7 out of 10.",5
11 December 2000,A deeply moving character study with terrific performances. ***1/2 (out of four),"PAY IT FORWARD / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)

To my sorrowful surprise, ""Pay it Forward"" received some negative reviews, tearing it apart due to preachy themes and overconfidence. The film, directed well by Mimi Leder (""Deep Impact,"" ""The Peacemaker,""), does contain an emotional message that eventually goes over the top. For the most part, though, it is careful not to be exceedingly peachy and stays down to earth, touching base with the majority of an audience. When the subject gets too serious, or when the stakes feel too trite, the movie also offers light-hearted comic relief, although it feels somewhat out of place. ""Pay it Forward"" fares as a better than average character study where those characters control where the plot goes, instead of the plot controlling where they go.

Trevor McKinny of Las Vegas is the main character here, and is played by the wonderfully talented Haley Joel Osment, who may have well taken over where Macaulay Culkin left off. Trevor is a character with a lot going on in his life, and is only eleven-years young. His mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt), is a struggling alcoholic who works two jobs as a waitress to make ends meet. His father, who left him and his mother due to alcohol issues, has not been seen for months, and it is his first day of school in the seventh grade.

One of his teachers is Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), an uncommonly intelligent individual whose physical scars shelter deeper emotional turmoil. Eugene is yet another complex character, with a disturbing circle of being and a motive for the first assignment he gives Trevor's class. The project, for extra credit, is to literally change the world in any way. Trevor reacts hesitantly with a contrived line of dialogue (""Are you saying you'll flunk us if we don't change the world?""), and Eugene remarks with similar contrivances (""Well, no. But you might just scrape by with a C."").

Trevor's plan, called ""Pay it Forward,"" is pyramid-like in which one person will help three other individuals do something they would not normally be able to do on their own, and in turn those people will do the same to three others and continue the growing trend. We witness this plan in action through an underdeveloped sub-plot starring Jay Mohr as a journalist from L.A. who smells a decent story involved with Trevor's outgoing scheme, and tries desperately to track him down.

What ""Pay it Forward"" does best is provide a character study that is passionate, empathetic, and emotionally challenging. The characters are deep, three dimensional, artistic and contain human depth. The film, based on the book by Catherine Ryan Hyde, has the same style as last year's gem, ""American Beauty,"" with an inspiring soundtrack providing a heartfelt backdrop for the story. This is a movie about tragedy and compassion and what can happen when someone like Trevor attempts to make a difference in the world.",8
16 July 2001,A film with its heart in the right place,"`Pay It Forward' is not a great film, but at least it has a good heart. I have been very critical of the film industry for it's irresponsible attitude towards filmmaking. Films like `Fight Club' and `Pulp Fiction' that glorify anarchy and mayhem send the wrong message to society. Other films like `Scary Movie' and `Road Trip' rely on humor that is so degrading that it lowers the general standard of societal norms by dulling our sense of revulsion at crass behavior. `Pay It Forward' sends a positive message to the masses and despite its unexceptional screenplay, I am gratified to see the effort.

The story centers on Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), a schoolboy who takes quite literally his teacher's challenge to change the world. He decides to do three favors for people and tells them that instead of paying the favor back, that they should pay it forward; they should do three favors for others. The concept is wonderfully idealistic and it is the kind of message we should be sending to society, rather than the hedonistic and nihilistic themes that pervade cinema today.

The screenplay itself meanders about without the discipline to stay on point. A good portion of the film is wasted on the romantic relationship developing between Trevor's mother (Helen Hunt) and his teacher (Kevin Spacey), which is a complete non sequitur. From a marketing perspective, I can understand the necessity of giving the audience a good bit of screen time with box office magnets rather than building the story on Osment and the main theme. However, only giving a few examples of how the favors were paid forward dilutes the true impact of that theme. A more effective way to structure the film would have been through a succession of vignettes that travel around the country and perhaps return to Trevor.

The ending failed to deliver the message intended. While I surmise that the writer intended that the ending convey the power and impact of goodness and kindness, ironically it sends the message that no good deed goes unpunished, slipping once again into the nihilistic realm of `why bother?'

The acting was consistently good. Kevin Spacey is an enormously talented actor and once again creates a compelling and complex character with extensive range. Helen Hunt is really miscast as the middle class mom. She comes across as so bright that it is hard to dumb her down enough to seem normal. Moreover, the romance between the two had all the chemistry of a PTA meeting. Haley Joel Osment is proving himself to be quite a talent after a riveting performance in `The Sixth Sense'. Once again he plays a difficult part with ease.

Despite structural flaws, I rated this film a 7/10 on the strength of the message. I would recommend it to anyone who has not given up hope that the world could be better than it is.",
16 July 2001,"Sweet, Well-Acted film","I felt that this film got a bum rap when it first was released. I felt the critics went out of their way to slam it; to be jaded and cynical about it's message, which, if you think about it, was what the film was all about. It was saying that we are all so suspicious of kindness, so jaded about human goodness, that no one would want to believe such an idea like Pay It Forward. This film is full of positive thought, full of the idea that each one of us can make a difference. Spacey and Osment give great performances. In fact, the first time Spacey talks to his Social Studies class and pitches the idea of the assignment is some of the finest work this gifted actor has ever done. Helen Hunt, unfortunately, is miscast in my opinion. She tries hard, TOO hard to come off as kind of a white trash single mom. She works so much and Ive seen so many of her recent films that her ""acting tricks"" are so damn obvious. When she's listening to someone and wonders what they mean, she lifts her eyebrows quizzically. She holds her hands together when she is trying to be sincere and when she is upset she always clasps her hand to her mouth. Listen, all actors have tricks that they use, but hers are so glaring and false. I enjoyed her work on TV in the Paul Resier sitcom, but in ""What Women Want"" ""As Good As It Gets"" and in htis film, she just seems to be acting and not very convincingly. But aside from Miss Hunt's performance, the film works and I enjoyed it. (P.S/ - boy is Bon Jovi bad in this film)",8
6 November 2000,A bit too silly,"This effort has several talented actors performing in a storyline better suited for an after school special. Hayley Joel Osment is a young boy who, in response to a challenge to change the world from his teacher(Kevin Spacey), comes up with the Pay it Forward concept of doing favors,without payback, for three people who will then do favors for three more, etc. Helen Hunt is the scattered single mom who winds up in an awkward romance with Spacey. The actors do their best, but really can't overcome the silliness ofthe storyline. GRADE: C

12 April 2001,Well...,"I have a fond spot for Pay It Forward, because it was the movie I saw during a recent cross-country trip. The three main actors did a good job, and I think Kevin Spacey was much better here than in American Beauty. I just couldn't buy him and Helen Hunt as a couple, but I digress. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as always, playing a sensitive and impressionable young kid. This film had a great premise, but sometimes premises look better on paper. Case in point, the HORRIBLE ending, the throwaway subplot of Angie Dickinson as the alcoholic grandmother, and Jon Bon Jovi in the small role as Hunt's estranged husband. (Couldn't they have cast an unknown in that part and not someone so recognizable?) Not a horrible film, but it could have been a lot better.

21 October 2000,Well-acted drama,"""Pay It Forward"" is a movie that I had been looking forward to seeing since it stars Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment. A movie with two Oscar-winning actors and an Oscar-nominee has got to be good, and ""Pay It Forward"" is a very good movie with the three stars giving strong performances. Osment plays Trevor, an 11-year-old starting 7th grade. Spacey plays Eugene, Trevor's new teacher who gives his class an unusual assignment: think of a way to make the world better. Hunt plays Arlene, Trevor's mother who's battling alcoholism. Trevor's idea for his assignment: each person should help three other people achieve something they couldn't have done on their own, and then those people each must do the same for three more people. And so on and so on. One of these deeds has Trevor trying to play matchmaker for his mom and teacher as he tries to get the two together. Then word catches on as other people do the exact same thing: pay it forward. This movie does get a little distracting with it's flashback moments. It starts with a reporter who runs into a man who pays the reporter forward. Then the movie flashes back a couple of months ago as Trevor starts school. The film keeps going back and forth between the reporter (who's striving for a story on the pay it forward scheme once he hears of it) and the Spacey-Hunt-Osment characters (where the pay it forward odyssey starts). It's a bit jarring at first, but then the two stories are neatly tied up later. And guess what? The movie has a surprise ending, just like Osment's last film ""The Sixth Sense"" (even though this ending is kind of different than the one in ""The Sixth Sense""). I didn't see this ending coming, and I won't reveal what happens. You'll just have to see the movie for yourself. ""Pay It Forward"" might get Oscar nods again for Spacey, Hunt, and Osment and I hope it does because their performances are the best thing in the movie. This is an extremely well-acted drama.

***1/2 (out of four)",9
17 October 2000,WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE,"What an acting team, Spacey, Hunt and Osmond. This was a fine movie and we really enjoyed it. Hadn't heard much about this one but it is really worth going to see. Don't pass this one up and it is great entertainment. Kevin Spacey can do no wrong and keeps getting better and better. Helen Hunt is so versital and what can you say about Haley Joel Osmond but what a child actor.

5 July 2006,"this is a film about people all being the same deep down, and how we are corrupt and judgemental more often than not....","In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

7 September 2001,Better than expected,"The only reason why I rented this film was Kevin Spacey. He is a wonderful actor and even though I'd never heard any good things about Pay It Forward, I still wanted to see it. My expectations weren't exactly high, and that could explain why I kind of liked the film. Melodramatic? Yes. Clichéd? Yes. But still... Most of the time I thought the film was interesting and I liked the Arlene-Eugene love story. Spacey was brilliant, Osment was great, and to my great surprise Helen Hunt was _almost_ believable. So, Pay It Forward was a much better film than I expected. (6/10)

2 June 2001,This movie was supremely touching throughout...,"This is a beautiful story made into a heart-warmingly excellent movie. The juxtaposition of a physically scarred man and an emotionally scarred woman (who both seem less scarred when they are together) is touching and poignant to say the least. The magnificence of the Trevor character (both in writing and in portray by Hayley Joel Osment) gives one a reason to believe in people again. My only criticism relates to how the story was converted to the big screen. In the novel, the Eugene character was an African-American veteran who was scarred in battle. In the movie, the character (played convincingly well by Kevin Spacey) was Caucasian and was burned by an abusive father. Both situations work well, but I was troubled (as an African-American man myself) that the only black character in the entire movie was a liar, gangbanger, and a thief. Sticking to the story as originally written would have given African Americans a more positive representation.

11 July 2001,Pay It Forward transforms the movie screen into a broad chalkboard marked with valuable lessons.,"Based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's book by the same name, Pay It Forward offers a noble premise which speaks of the need to improve the world, and which redefines the responsibilities of teachers, parents and children. Pay It Forward effectively uses an economy of language, images and plot to expose --straightforwardly and truthfully-- complicated issues such as education, school violence, poverty, guns, alcohol and domestic abuse.

On his first day of school, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) gets an unexpected first assignment: ""Think of an idea to change the world --and put it into action."" Seeking to inspire his students to think globally and unselfishly and to reconsider their role in the world, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) soon notices Trevor's unique potential. Yet when Trevor applies himself to the assignment and begins by inviting a homeless man into his home, his hardworking, single mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) is infuriated and questions Eugene's methods. Still, Eugene is impressed by Trevor's ""Pay It Forward"" class project, which dictates that if one person benefits from someone's act of good will, he or she must ""pay it forward"" to three more people, who in turn must pay another good deed to three other people. Although often disillusioned by the difficulty of putting such a faith-based plan into motion, Trevor's impaired relationship with his mother and a deep resentment toward his absent father provide the fuel for his dedication and desire to improve lives. When his efforts to help turn toward his own teacher, Trevor learns that to improve the world, people must learn to welcome change.

Set in Las Vegas, Nevada, Pay It Forward delivers its plot through an effective perspective, which focuses on the austerity of the city rather than on its more identifyable flashy streets and festive casinos. This choice stresses the realism behind those grave issues the film tries to explore. Although Pay It Forward mostly conveys with unadorned realism the suffering caused by hate or negligence, the film becomes overly melodramatic when it delves into its secondary characters' confessions of their personal tragedies. Rather than supporting the idea of the need for other people's helping hand, these scenes --often accompanied by bittersweet piano music-- seem to exploit the concept of suffering. Nevertheless, Pay It Forward supports its own premise (concerning the plausibility of improving the world) by weaving into its main storyline several flash-forward scenes that demonstrate a widespread effectiveness and national popularity of the ""pay-it-forward movement"", only months after it was launched by its young author. All in all, Pay It Forward applies drama and humor and successfully teaches valuable lessons that speak of the need for a national consciousness.",7
28 July 2022,Leave your mark on history,"The film ""Pay Another"" was released several decades ago, but this picture still stands apart in my memories. I saw this movie as a teenager, and now, a couple of decades after watching it, I understand how the attitude to the film, its understanding can change. Of course, it depends on the age of the viewer. We are changing, and the attitude to this or that work, in particular to this film, is changing. At first, the story was very hooked, over time it turned into a kind of unrealizable fairy tale that was shown on the screen, and now I think that this is a necessary story that calls on all people of the world to become at least a little kinder and more unselfish, not to expect gratitude from others for their actions, and maybe one day become the very person who to whom ""someone will pay in advance"", this chain of good deeds will return your start, and this help will be very important and timely for you.

The main character of the film, the director's chair of which was occupied by Mimi Leder (""Peacemaker"", ""Collision with the Abyss""), is a boy named Trevor. The guy performs the task of a new teacher, who was perfectly played by Kevin Spacey. Trevor is going to change the world with the help of the ""Pay it Forward"" concept, in which he will help three people, who in turn will help the other three people. The experiment is interesting, but quite difficult to implement, which the viewer observes on the screen. The concept of the work, which, by the way, takes as a basis the novel of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde, allows you to feel all the ambiguity of this approach of assistance and to trace the interesting evolution of the main characters of the film.

The film does not appear as a Hollywood beautiful story, where the hero succeeds. On the contrary, this film is intended to show how important it is not to flirt with real life, but to be aware of the possible consequences for yourself and others for your actions. Real life may be inspired by a colorful story from the screen, but this is not a call to action by copying. Every seemingly positive initiative should be well thought out and applied in the harsh realities of our world. After all, our world is full of unpleasant surprises and is ready to grind altruists, throwing them away as unnecessary. But also, ""Pay Another"" allows you to look at humanity with hope. After all, one way or another, good deeds can work miracles and improve people's lives, teach them to live correctly and according to conscience, find their happiness and, at least sometimes, accept unselfish help, and not suspect an assistant of something hypocritical and bad. Sadly. But today our society is used to the fact that if a person is ready to help just like that, then he is clearly pursuing some goal for himself. Gone is the distant time when people were ready to help each other just like that. Hmm. Was there a time at all?

The picture itself turned out to be memorable. All this became possible thanks to an excellent script, high-quality directing and excellent acting. Haley Joel Osment became a real discovery of his time. The guy looks organically in the frame, keeps the whole movie on himself, and his character is remembered by an amazing story. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt are good in the frame. They perfectly demonstrate contradictory characters who have to learn to live and understand each other and themselves, while relying on the child's still unclouded mind. At some point, Trevor, played by Osment, becomes a mentor for Arlene (Helen Hunt) and Eugene (Kevin Spacey).

The film is considered too dramatic. Yes. I also thought so in the past. But, as I said at the beginning of my story, the attitude to the picture changes with age. We all grow up, see the world from a different angle, through the prism of our own experience. And so now I am ready to accept this picture as it is in full, getting used to the dramatic approach that we see on the screen. I just think that we should see something more behind this drama and bring at least a piece of positivity from this picture into the real world. Sometimes it's difficult, because we all live in a frenzied rhythm of society, where it's not enough to think about other people's problems when you're drowning in your own. But you should learn to do it, to help other people, because if at least those who you help today learn to do it, it is likely that after a while such help will return to you through the concept of ""Pay in advance"".

The film came out memorable. He is interesting, instructive, extraordinary. The picture will definitely be remembered and will become one of the favorites, which maybe the audience will want to review again and even show it to others, thereby ""paying in advance"" and simply smiling at a good response for the recommendation.

2 November 2007,God-awful,"Maybe, I'm just not all that bright-and-sunny. But, you have to be really really childish, to go lets: ""make the world better"". The world is complex, and darkishly beautiful, if I may say that. And this one-way, narrow thinking of having to fix this world in order to confide to some (selfish) standard is just plain bad.

The movie fails to ""emotionally"" manipulate, which was the whole point of what the producers were trying to do.

Now, go ahead and ""pay-it-forward"" by NOT recommending this movie to anyone! Spare them from the boredom, and hours of eye-rolling from watching this ""air-head"" movie.

26 June 2006,A very heartfelt film.,"Pay It Forward tells the story of a teacher who gives his class an assignment. Write a paper on how you can change the world. One boy comes up with the idea of paying it forward, a system where one person helps three people, and those three people help three people, and those nine people help three people, and so on. At first, people are skeptical of the idea, but he puts it to the test. Amazingly, paying it forward reaches right across the USA, and an investigative reporter ends up trying to trace the story to its source. This is a very inspirational movie that makes you think.

The whole plot behind the movie is what makes it so good. Just the thought that people would actually care that much for paying it forward that they'd do it. You just know that in real life if you told someone that idea they'd shoot you down. The movie has a nice message to it, and it really makes you feel and think. It has a nice little subplot behind it as well, so the movie doesn't get too preachy and boring. It's paced out just fine.

The acting, of course, is phenomenal. Kevin Spacey is an acting genius, especially when he plays complex characters such as this. Haley Joel Osment is a great talent as well.

Overall, this is a great film that tugs at the heart strings, and it's entertaining at the same time.

8 October 2001,It didn't change my life,"Of course, I never really considered myself to be such an *sshole. But ""Pay it Forward"" (and many a comment) promises a lot - and this film is pretty good. But it doesn't really satisfy me. It is exceptionally well acted, but that's no surprise: all three leads have proven their worth more than once. Osment must be the most talented child actor the world has ever seen. It's kind of hard to answer what it is that this film lacks, but I'll give it a shot: it fails to make the idea of paying it forward feel like a great one. It focuses on other things that are not as interesting and in the end, it just feels as if the world is exactly the same place as it was before. Nothing really happened. And there it is.

19 July 2008,"Like a pyramid scheme, but with good deeds!","I love this movie! I have seen it numerous times and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye at the end.

There is a central inspiring message in this movie that we can make the world a better place by doing good deeds. Even though there is heartbreak and tragedy in life, ultimately we can overcome if we stick together and help each other. I know a lot of cynics will find this all to be a bunch of melodramatic hogwash - but so be it. I choose to believe there is still good in the world - even in the midst of great evil (i.e. the ending).

There are phenomenal performances here by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment. I especially am blown away by Osment's portrayal. I'm sad I haven't seen anything noteworthy from him since 2003 in Secondhand Lions (although not my favorite of his performances compared to ""Pay it Forward"" and ""Sixth Sense"").

I don't want to give away any of the surprise twists - this is a MUST SEE movie!",9

19 October 2000,Best film since the Golden Age of Hollywood.,"How many times have you heard ""They don't make films like they used to (in the golden age)."" Well here they do. Lots of people (especially Hollywood and the critics that hob-nob there) hate it when films don't applaud general chaos (the so-called 'drugs-sex-and-rock-and-roll' variety). It's easier to push nose candy up one's nose, down a quart of tequila, and go out for a night on the town looking for some pay sex if a film tells you that there is some redeeming value in it. This is why Hollywood awards hooker roles so much, it validates their life styles. Heaven to bid if the film paints this as a no-no. If a film reminds you that there is a higher road to take and that road is not easily traveled, then it's easier to trash the film and go back to a loser lifestyle. Even Forrest Gump was a hero who had good fortune thrown at him via destiny as opposed to conscious decisions. Try to live up to high ideals? Oh no no, that's too cotton candy sweet, life is not like that at all. Life is about wallowing in the gutter. Get over it!!!! Watch this film. Live up to its ideals. And stop embarrassing yourselves. It's okay if your outlook on life doesn't rise higher than a worm's tummy, but don't admit it to anyone! Better yet, go watch this film...and take notes.

15 October 2004,"Sacharine sweet, and gets silly","Certainly this is a family film so a level of sentimentality is to be expected, but this one descends into a world of slush beyond what even Winnie the Pooh could tolerate.

Kevin Spacey is Eugene Simonet, or Mr Simonet to his 7th Grade school class. He assigns a task to them on their very first day - to somehow try to change the world - have an impact on society in some way. Generally viewed as a rhetorical mission, one child, Trevor (Played by the inimitable Haley Joel Osmont), takes it utterly seriously and sets out to make the world a better place by way of his 'pay it forward' scheme whereby you do someone a favour they cannot do for themselves, and they have to do likewise for 3 people, who have to do likewise for 3 each, and so on.

When romance seems to be on the cards for Eugene and Trevor's mother Arlene, it appears one of Trevor's favours is working. However, events conspire to attempt to stick spanners in the works. As they always do...

Basically this is a bit of a love story with an attempt at a moral message of 'be nice to each other and give a damn'. It's certainly helped out substantially by predictably excellent performances from the main 3 players, namely Spacey, Osment and Helen Hunt as Trevor's troubled alcoholic mother.

Its problem is just that it's simply too goody goody to take seriously. It's obviously a bit of a fantasy premise but never for a second can we suspend our disbelief. And the ending is an absolute parody of the whole film and had me laughing, such was its absurdity.

Yes, its well directed, well acted and the all round quality is genuine, but if the basic plot gets this unbelievable, the other aspects are futile.

Reasonable family film but don't expect anything memorable.",
29 October 2000,LACKING A DIRECTOR'S CONVICTION,"Catherine Ryan Hyde's book is adapted for the screen by writer Leslie Dixon ('Mrs. Doubtfire'). I really enjoyed the performances in this film. Recent turns for the cast in Oscar winning and Oscar nominated roles make every project they take on an extra challenge because people will be watching them with great scrutiny. They don't fail here. Kevin Spacey is a sensitive yet head strong teacher. Haley Joel Osment is his star pupil with an alcoholic mom (Helen Hunt) with whom Spacey falls in love. The problem with the film is Mimi Leder's conviction as the director. I felt the film dragged on with too many needless sub plots not given enough of an energetic push. I also was disappointed with the scatter shot elements of Spacey's surroundings. Not enough scenes were filmed in his classroom where the film could have drawn extra inspiration. I would still give it a 7 out of 10 but this is an example of how a great story can be made to suffer with fairly mediocre direction.

5 October 2002,An excellent movie with a sadly not-so-excellent ending.,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

21 November 2014,A brilliant story with brilliant acting.,"I discovered this film about 3 years or so back and loved it. Haley Joel Osment was an amazing child actor, its just too bad that he had to grow up (not that his acting now is bad, I actually haven't watched any of his recent films). Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey was incredible as well, and the chemistry and acting between these three was phenomenal. (Also, Hunt is so fit it's ridiculous).

The concept of the story is brilliant. It's become such a saying now to 'pay it forward' but I'm not sure if it even originated from this movie. The concept was told in a terrific way and really captured the ripple effect. Some viewers might not like this (being cynics), but I love it.

Here we have a kid who was is doing his best to change the world while the adults who initially encouraged him to are ultimately the ones holding him back. I cried the first time I watched it, and though I didn't cry during the second time, I could really feel the emotions emitting from the screen. I was actually suppressing my laughter during the climactic scene because I was waiting to see if my guy friend would cry (he didn't), but the bubble of laughter died away really quickly and gave way to sadness. The family dynamics as well as the interactions with his teacher was so well executed and detailed that it just brought the whole film together.

To me this film is near flawless because I love it so much. However there was one part (can't remember which) that had some gadget or other that did not fit the time it was set in. But really that's such a minor thing.

27 September 2018,Inspiring,"The concept is beautiful and all else pales in comparison. Helen Hunt is trailor trashy and Kevin Spacey is physically and emotionally scarred, so it's an unlikely couple that is brought together by her son and his pupil, Haley Joel Osment. However, what we are seeing is a realistic portrayal of the world's people and their problems, which offers very fertile ground for a child wanting to help make the world a better place, even if his comprehension of the nature of those problems is superficial and simplistic. And while the film plays a little too blatantly with our emotions, it does show how the 6 degrees of separation can indeed work as a network for positive change across the entire world. That's what makes it inspiring.

20 October 2000,They should have paid more attention to the story.,"Humans suck. If you require proof, check out the headlines of any major newspaper or turn on CNN- raging wars, people starving, rampant drug abuse and kids killing other kids for running shoes. Reuben St. Clair, a social studies teacher, believes that he can make a difference by going to the source. He gives his sixth graders a simple assignment - make the world a better place. What he doesn't realize is that he may provide a young man with the inspiration to do just that.

The novel by Catherine Hyde had barely hit the shelves when the writers began work on the screenplay. Paying it forward is a unique concept: rather than repay someone who does you a good turn, you do a good turn for three others, which would in theory result in exponential altruism till all is right with the planet. Okay, maybe I'm being a tad facetious, but movies that expound such optimistic sentiments are rare. More importantly, the idea isn't that outlandish - while it might not be a global phenomenon, what is the worst thing that could happen? A lot of people would help a lot of other people? Unfortunately, the message gets lost in the translation.

I had been anticipating this film for some time - I like all the principle actors involved in the project and the story line appealed to me - so I was one of the first people in line to see the sneak preview. It did not take long however to see that there were problems: the characters are unoriginal (drunken single mother, troubled teacher with a secret, outcast young boy), the relationship between the mother and the teacher becomes the focus of the film, and the coincidences are quite a stretch. And is it that hard to come up with a score? This one was lifted almost directly from ""American Beauty"". I was able to overlook these faults, but I could not forgive the ending, which was cheap and unnecessary - I had predicted it in the first five minutes and hoped they would prove me wrong. Thankfully, the actors don't disappoint.

With two Oscars on his mantle, Kevin Spacey is definitely doing something right. Although Reuben is both physically and mentally scarred, Spacey is careful not to make him a walking victim, imbuing him with a careful balance of insecurity and a buoyant nature that are the source of his infectious inspiration. Helen Hunt is uncharacteristically down to earth - her appearance the-morning-after-the-night-before was both hysterical and pathetic - proving that she is so much more than Jaime Buckman. I was most surprised by Haley Joel Osment: he showed a seldom seen maturity in ""The Sixth Sense"" that was pivotal to the believability of the film. In this film it is his ability to play a regular kid - specifically the scene in which he is being interviewed - that is indicative of his true talents.

People will like this film, they will laugh and they will cry. But I still can't help feeling having been unnecessarily manipulated.",

13 May 2001,Grieving Las Vegas,"Despite the emotional tide that overtakes the final moments of this film, the darn thing just doesn't work. I think the cause of this film's failure is the casting of three (count 'em, three) of Hollywood's biggest stars. Osment would be a perfect fit as the kid inspired to change the world, but having Oscar owners Hunt and Spacey shoehorned in (playing roles they are far from perfect for) demands that the film leave Osment for blind alleys and side trips that don't pay - forward or back. To prove my point, look at the other comments that rave about the leads' ""acting"". You never forget that you are watching good talent at work and get lost in the story, as you should. Jay Mohr, Jon Bon Jovi and Angie Dickinson join Spacey and Hunt in the miscast category; their small stories upstaged by their star presence. Likewise, Thomas Newman's neo-modern scoring (so perfect for THE PLAYER) is cold and out of place in this heart-tugger.

20 January 2002,Very moving picture.,"Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment make good performance in Pay It Forward. Spacey plays a teacher who gives an assignment to his students, and asks what you would to change the world for the better. Osment who plays one of his students takes the assignment a step further. His helps others not by being pay, but doing kindness to others and match mates his teacher with his mom who is played by Helen Hunt. It is worth watching. Spacey praised Osment for his acting and said he is a better actor than actors five times his age. I will not be surprised if Osment becomes a director one day.

12 October 2002,Is it possible for one idea to change the world?,"When a movie points out such a great idea to help the many people that live in the world, then I am certain that it can only have a positive impact on its audience. Pay It Forward, for mine, does exactly that. It shows what one favour can do, for this incredibly selfish and unforgiving world. Sure this movie is a bit of a tear-jerker', but that only enhances it all the more. This is the bittersweet and uplifting tale that was written by novelist Catherine Ryan Hyde.

Just imagine. You do a favour that really helps someone and you tell him or her not to pay it back but to pay it forward to three other people who, in turn, each pay it forward to three more  and on and on into a global outpouring of kindness and decency. Impossible? That is one word that junior high school student Trevor McKinney will not accept. How much impact can one heartfelt idea have?

Director, Mimi Leder, transformed a very simple story into a good movie. I can understand that some people might not have liked the direction that she took her audience on, but for me it was still of great enjoyment. The story that she was given did help her in my opinion, but other people could say it hurt her and the movie. I like the very simple setting that Leder gave us. To base the movie around a school project is clever, but to then make it become a very complex and touching story was great.

There is some extremely good talent on show in this movie. Haley Joel Osment ceases to amaze me. He is truly a star. Take into consideration his mind-blowing performance in the Sixth Sense, I was sure that he could not do any better than that. While he might not achieve the same heights in this movie, I enjoyed the role he performs. He is the perfect person to make a difference' in the world.

The adults in this film were also terrific. I like the work of Kevin Spacey. He was the very complex teacher, but wounded Eugene Simonet. I like how he and Trevor have a very special understanding. I have been keen to follow Spacey since his Academy award-winning role in American Beauty'. I will continue to track him carefully. Helen Hunt is a very attractive actress, who plays Trevor's mother Arlene. She is an alcoholic, who is struggling to juggle the responsibilities of two jobs and be a mother. I found her role to very genuine. Yet somehow her son makes her realise that if she does not wake up to herself, she will remain in a lot of trouble. The way that Haley, interacts with both Spacey and Hunt onscreen is very special.

There are many touching and poignant scenes in `Pay it Forward'. The start is very ingenious, as that is where we see this chain reaction start. I also like the first scene with Spacey and how he gives his Social Studies class there first assignment on the blackboard: Think of an idea that could change the world. One of the more important scenes in this movie is when we Iearn how Mr. Simonet was burned and scarred, as it really had a big effect on me. There are also many scenes that show Trevor doing both his assignment and helping to really change the world. These are all priceless from Osment. Also seeing Trevor's mother tackling her alcohol addiction are tremendous, as one scene in particular between Arlene and Trevor makes her wake up and take note that she really does have a problem. I am not going to give away the ending, but from where I viewed it, I think it is fitting to say the least.

This film for me has a very biblical feeling attached to it. Although it might not be intentional, I am glad a movie like this does so. As a Christian and a believer in the Christian ethos, the message Pay it forward' gives, is not unlike that of Jesus Christ. He was of the same opinion that people should not pay back a favour, but pay it forward, so that only good things can happen in the world. If we all in some way follow this very simple message, then the world can change and be a better place for us all.

In conclusion, we can all learn a valuable lesson from this movie. If we show one small act of compassion, then perhaps our world is not in as bad a trouble as we all think. With all the current talk of war, all our world leaders need to do is view a film such as Pay It Forward', and then we might be a little closer to having the peace that we long for so much. Watch out for an appearance by singer, Jon Bon Jovi, and a terrific song in the credits titled Calling all angels', that really does give this film a fitting finale.

CMRS gives Pay It Forward': 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)",
7 October 2000,Practice Random Acts of Kindness.......,"That is the message I got while watching this film, that if someone does good for you, you should do good to others. And hey, I dig that, I mean, I too also live by that motto. But with the new movie PAY IT FORWARD, it tells you that when someone does good for you, you should do good for three other people. The film starts with young Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) a boy who is just entering the 7th grade. His social studies teacher, Mr. Ruben St. Clair (Kevin Spacey), who most students are afraid of because of his appearance. His face is covered with burn marks on his flesh. Mr. St. Clair gives his students a year long extra credit project. The topic: see what you can do to change the world. Treavor decides to take this project to the heart, and why shouldn't he? His mother, Alrene McKinney (Helen Hunt) has two jobs in different Las Veags casinos just to support her child. Trevor's dad had left Arlene alone to take care of Trevor, and since Arlene can't make things perfect for Trevor, she hides away and drinks her problems away. After Trevor takes in a homeless man (Jim Caviezel) and sees what a success his ""pay it forward"" project is, he decides to work on a bigger project. Trevor decides to find a mate for the lonely and feared Mr. St. Clair, and the mate is Trevor's mom! As Trevor tries his hardest to get know one another, both Ruben and Arlene fall in love with each other. The theme that PAY IT FORWARD tries to bring to the viewer is well intention. One, like I said earlier, the ""practice random acts of kindness."" Two, that everyone in life has it's faults, and we are all scared by it, whether it's emotional or physical. Three, that it doesn't matter how one looks, but acts that one can find true love. And four, that one person if they try hard enough, can change the world. And I enjoy messages like that, but what got to me during this movie is that at times it seemed too ""cute"" and it looks like it's a film that came from the Oprah show. The message is strong, and if director Mim Leder wanted to make a strong movie, she should have had more emotional powerful scenes than lightweight scenes. But there are some strong emotional scenes in this film. What makes the scenes strong isn't Leder, but Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment. All three leads give wonderful performances that really make this movie stand out. Spacey is in top form (as usual) as the both emotional and physical scared Ruben St. Clair. A man who has never been in love because he feels that he'll get rejected by his appearance (I know how that feels). Hunt is also quite good as the workaholic and alcoholic mother, Arlene, who feels that her ex-husband will return some day, and things will be better in the end. But the other character's admit that she's only kidding herself, and Arlene knows it also, but is afraid to admit it. Then young Osment (who is the best child actor since Jodie Foster) gives another good performance as Trevor, who believes that one man can change the world, and he has the heart and ambition to do it. But it's the support actors from this movie that fall short. With such good actors like Jay Mohr, Jim Caviezel, Jon Bon Jovi, and Angie Dickinson, you figured that they too would be good. But Mimi Leder let's the spotlight shine on the three leads, while the rest of the cast are watching in the dark outside of the light. I really did enjoy the location shots (in and around Las Vegs). Vegas is my second home, next to Phoenix, I know my way around Vegas as if I lived there. And watching this movie I enjoyed watching the scenes the story takes place. What I liked about PAY IT FORWARD is that unlike any other Vegas film, it's not a character. In such previous Vegas films like CASINO, SHOWGIRLS, CON-AIR, and LEAVING LAS VEGAS, the city of Vegas played a significant part. Where in this film, it's just where the story takes place (because it also took place in Vegas in the novel). What got to me was the choppy plot. It seem to jump back and forth between scenes that it really doesn't explain the scene, just the message it's getting across. And that's all fine and done, but why should we follow the message. That is what Leder should have concentrated on, instead of the performances of the leads (the three leads can do fine without Leder's help). And because the story is so choppy, it also leaves plot holes that never do explain itself by the end of the film. I did enjoy PAY IT FORWARD, and I can barely recommend it. I recommend it for three of these reasons: 1.) the wonderful acting performances by the leads, who can show that they can act great in any film. 2.) the location shots of Las Vegas, as it's the first time in a while that it's portrayed as a city, not a character. 3.) the message that it's sending towards the audience. Where some filmmakers are sending messages of the negativity of the world, it's good to see something positive being sent out. But PAY IT FORWARD isn't the AMERICAN BEAUTY, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, & SIXTH SENSE that most customers are going to expect to see. **** (out of five)",
18 May 2002,Almost misses chick-flick status,"Based on R1 DVD 123 min.

Battle scarred Spacey and skimpily clad Hunt do their best; boy wonder Osment is good as the open vulnerable child but for all it's charm the movie is destroyed by the last five minutes. Leave early and you'll think more of it, unless you like being forced to wallow in an ocean of sentimentality.

6/10 worth watching, shame about the ending.

17 April 2007,Warm and beautiful story that will stay in your heart,"""Pay it forward"" is a story about young boy Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment)who is trying to adopt to new life. His mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) is always on the move so young Trevor never has enough time to settle in the area. After first day in school Trevor meets his new professor Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey)who has his face burned. Soon Trevor and Eugene develop strong friendship and Trevor is trying to replace a father he never had in a character of a man who has a very painful past. Eugene gives Trevor an idea how he can make the world a better place.

Director Mimi Leder succeeded to make a very beautiful movie about problems in life that every man has. The characters are so realistic that you can almost imagine yourself in some situation of the film. Everyone can learn something from this movie and you can even cry in some of the scenes of the film. If you decide to watch it you won't regret it and if you already watched it pay attention to some details that you've missed.

I think that casting is really good and that is probably because there are so many interesting names who worked on this project. First of all Kevin Spacey. He can act almost everything and he is brilliant in this role. Watch his every move and you'll see that he is amazing. Then Helen Hunt. An excellent actress who holds very high place in my book. The last of the main actors is Haley Joel Osment. That kid really knows how to act and there are some parts of the movie were he takes the lead. He isn't afraid to act with actors like Spacey or Hunt. Angie Dickinson is always good and it is very pleasant surprise to watch James Caviezel and Jon Bon Jovi in their roles. Especially Jon Bon Jovi who is one of my favorite singers and he is a true rock star. Jon, it is always nice to see you in movie like this.

After everything I said now I want to watch this movie once again. Join me!",7
10 March 2004,Pay to see this movie,"Kevin Spacey won the academy award for the wrong movie. I can't believe such an awful movie like ""American Beauty"" would land him ""Pay It Forward"" was an extremely touching, moving and inspiring film that will touch everyone who sees it; furthermore, it is a movie that will take your breath away.

Haley Joel Osment returns to the screen with a bang. Osment portrays Trevor McKinney, a seventh grader who turns a ordinary homework assignment into a mission to change the world.

Kevin Spacey rebounds well from a disappointing ""American Beauty"" to take the role of Eugene Simmonette, Trevor's teacher. Spacey showed why he was the man for this role by taking the bull by the horns and tackling like it was just another day at the office. His performance screamed YES!!!!! this is the guy I want on my side because he was unafraid to to stand up for his beliefs and convictions as well as lend an ear to the problems that Trevor is facing.

Osment was good in ""The Sixth Sense"" but he is deserving of an oscar for ""Pay It Forward"" because he not only touches the lives of the people he helps but those who are around him with the spirit and enthusiasm he exudes in ""Pay It Forward."" Who would have thought a seventh grader would touch so many lives simply by completing his homework. Adding to this awesome movie is Jay Mohr, who plays the reporter following the story of this idea that Trevor has came up with.

""Pay It Forward"" is a movie that will stick in my mind for years to come because it contains the message that there are people places and ideas you can change to make the world a better place. This film also delivers hope that maybe if one does a good deed for someone they will in turn do one for someone else and may discontinue the violent acts.

""Pay It Forward"" is a credit to all the writers and director because the actors were able to deliver top performances with an outstanding script and direction. If I never see another movie this year I will be satisfied.",
22 October 2000,What a concept!What a movie! What a cast!,"We loved everything about this movie, from the concept to the entire cast. Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment should get nominations as should the picture. It was another fine acting performance by the entire cast. A very moving and wonderful movie. We laughed, we cried it is just what you want from a movie and it leaves you with great hope. If you pay it forward you will be a better person.

2 February 2001,Pay It Forward will change your life forever,"Haley Joel Osment, Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt shine in this terrific movie. It's a movie about life, about the world how it is today, and how you've got to flip around the things you don't like in this world. Too hard, too difficult, impossible, you say. Well, this movie is giving you an idea how you could do it. Because nothing will happen if nobody begins with it. (You'll understand this after you've seen this movie.) And don't believe Leonard Maltin, I'm very disappointed in this critic. This movie was probably too emotional for him. But if you, like me, not afraid for a movie that touches your heart, you've got to see this. So go out, and watch Pay It Forward, and maybe, we can actually change lives. It sure will hange yours.

11 October 2006,What Does It Accomplish?,"PAY IT FORWARD ****1/2 'Pay It Forward' accomplishes what few films try doing in the first place: Tapping its characters into harsh realities that they must face and endure without sugar coating it, by which viewers learn the importance of how leaning on others for support can help in real-life situations. Based on the title novel by Catherine Ryan Hyde, this adaptation does not shy away from boldly exploiting a world's evil amid its major premise: A troubled boy (Haley Joel Osment) coming up with a self-effacing idea - a.k.a. ""Pay It Forward"" - that impacts people of a greater expanse than he may of anticipated. His three ""subjects"" include a homeless man, his emotionally distraught mom (Helen Hunt), and the teacher who inspired him (Kevin Spacey). The one flat note in Leslie Dixon's screenplay is the not-quite-on-par timeline he incorporates into the story. The lead players are excellent: Spacey, in top form, as the man with a haunting past whom many people can't see behind his scarred face; Hunt, as the sincere but somewhat unbalanced parent who rises to the challenge of truly loving; and Osment, a coming-of-age renown. Don't miss this film in light of its apparent heaviness in plot, because it is a film that enlightens, inspires, and strangely intrigues when given the opportunity.

22 May 2001,** Horrible!,"Horrendously cheesy film that leaves an excellent performance by Helen Hunt swamped by directionless direction by Mimi Leder (maybe she should stick to the action genre after all) and a hackneyed screenplay. The plot follows the plight of a troubled and shy young boy (Haley Joel Osment, his first post-Academy Award nomination role) who is given an assignment at school to change the world by his burn-scarred seventh grade teacher (Kevin Spacey in a disappointingly melodramatic performance). His idea is to do something generous for somebody, in the best case a stranger, who you then instruct to pay the kindness forward to three people instead of paying the donor back. The film's alternate plot follows Jay Mohr as he tries to work his way backwards through the story to find out who it was that originated the Pay It Forward movement; despite Mohr's noted talent, this subplot is so distracting and quite frankly so boring that you just want to close your eyes and stick your fingers in your ears every time the film goes in his direction. Hunt's lyrical performance as Osment's mother truly is the film's one reward, and any time she's left alone with any of the characters is pretty much the only time you feel any genuine, non-manipulating emotion coming your way. However, her role is so close to that in her Academy Award-winning performance as Carol in As Good As It Gets that most viewers will find they're not getting anything too new out of it. The film's ending is probably one of the very worst of the year, giving one the impression that they simply ran out of money and had to just the end film right there. Best to leave this one alone.",
22 November 2001,pain it forward ....,"oh!! heavens!!!! what an incredibly painful movie. the ,movie goes over the top and all preachy. if you are the kind of person that loves to read self help books. go watch this movie. if you like a little realism in your movies stay away from this nausea inducing movie. the movie is unbelievably corny.

pay it forward is full of improbable sequences and although its all great and very idealistic the infeasibility is so staggering. add to it the cliched characters, god the kevin spacey character was so cliched it wasnt funny. the same goes for helen hunt's character. the only redeeming aspect are the terrific performances from the led actors.

a few points fo acting and good intentions. lots docked for gross stupidity.

an irritating 4!!

3 April 2001,The sad part is what might have been,"This is a disgustingly manipulative movie that could, and should, have been much better. It is well acted by all the principals and begins with an original premise presented by the Osment character in reaction to an assignment from his social studies teacher (Spacey), i.e., that if everyone performed a benevolent act for other people, and each of these 3 did likewise, a chain of good would be created that might engulf the whole world. If the film had stayed with this idea and let it take it to wherever it might naturally lead, it might have been an excellent film, even a minor classic. But this principal idea is soon abandoned and the film degenerates into a perfectly predictable soap opera, with Osment trying to spark a romance between his reclusive and wounded teacher and his recovering alcoholic, ""trailer trash [the character's words]"" mother (Helen Hunt). Despite their obviously being from two different worlds, will they end up in the sack together? What do you think? Will her no good, abusive husband shown up on her doorstep, saying he's changed, and beg to be taken back? Will she take him back? If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you know the answers to these questions, too.

All of the above would have made this just an ordinary bad film. What makes this descend into true wretchedness, however, is the ending, which I won't reveal here. Suffice it to say that this ending makes even Hollywood's most maudlin tearjerkers seem like works of art in comparison. Why? Because the ending is so gratuitous and so unrelated to anything that went before. I don't know how well this thing did at the box office. I'm inclined to think not too well, because it didn't stay around too long. But the studio deserves to loose its shirt on this one, and I hope it does.",5
15 August 2013,My rating: 8,"So, the moment for moral talking came. We will abstract the play of the actors, the requisite and the stage production. They are not bad, do not get me wrong! The most important thing this time will be the idea.

Made up by a kid or not, real or not, it is important. It shows the insignificance of the pompous speech, egoism, material goods, career. The only thing left is the love between the closest ones and between people. The altruism and the mutual aid. Paying it forward.

(Time for commercial) And paying it forward, as we saw, is being made by teachers and humanitarian sciences, when they are made from heart. In no way I want to bent the other fields of the knowledge but I want to say clear that human relationships are what makes life good or bad. Why others are not able to see the help as a good to them, why they think that when they are making bad to the others are making good to themselves – these are questions which stay outside the movie which shows the presence of a childish, unencumbered psychically and conceptually world.

Does living in such a world is hard to achieve or absolutely possible, this is up to every one of you and the answer concerns the rest.

9 July 2001,waste of time,"Pay It Forward begins beautifully and ends awfully. How ridiculous is its script. The story wants to tell us something but in a most stupid way. How could Kevin Spacy accept to perform in such a movie? Haley Joel Osment was a bad choice. He was amazing in The Sixth Sense, but disappointing in this movie. In the other word, don't waste your time watching it.

24 July 2001,There actually is a real Foundation due to this film.,"The story for this film comes from a book by Catherine Ryan Hyde. She has set up the Pay it Forward Foundation. You can find this using a good search engine. Already this organization has had actual positive results.

So for those who do not like this film because it is too sappy, and considering that there is way too much suffering in this harsh world of ours, all I can say to you is: BLAAAAAAH ! The story for this film makes a valiant attempt to bring goodness into our lives. Every time this has been done there are those who criticize and moan. Surely Mother Teresa had her fair share of such people.

Have a read of the variety of comments here on IMDB, and if you don't like uplifting films of this sort then stay away and let others benefit from it.

By the way, the song ""Calling All Angels"" at the end has wonderful lyrics that can be found with persistent searching on the Net (the lyrics are under some sort of legal dispute). Have a close read of these song lyrics and you will understand the essence of the film.",
21 October 2000,Exactly What I Expected From A Haley Joel Osment Movie,"I have been a fan of Haley Joel Osment's for several years. After his astounding performance in ""Sixth Sense"", I definitely wanted to see if his acting stature could remain intact. And I was not disappointed. Haley shines in this movie, supported by many big name actors. Definitely a must see for any pre-teen or early-teenager.

27 February 2003,"manipulative, uncreative","""Pay it Forward"" was painful for me. I have a great deal of sympathy for the premise, and I haven't read the book so I can't comment on the adaptation aspect. 1) This film's ending is as unnecessary and manipulative as other people are saying. You might very well cry, but if you have any self-respect you'll feel dirty while you're doing it. After all, it has all the subtlety of porn. 2) Anybody who was shocked by the big personal revelation of the Spacey character should not be allowed to vote. 3) Even the paying forward concept is handled in a very uncreative way.

5 November 2005,Inspirational message of eternal validity,"This movie is great. Yeah, I mean, it has an outstanding cast (Caviezel, Haley, Spacey, Hunt) and a message. A real, pure, inspirational message. A message that makes you think. A message that shows you what is possible. A message that reveals how one idea, one individual concept can evolve into a string of events that eventually changes deadlocked conventions and opens our hearts to love and benevolence. Haley acts, as always, as genuine and as mature as we know it from him. The interaction between him, his mother and Kevin Spacey as his teacher is wonderful and appears to be very natural. I think that everyone can deduce something from this wonderful movie and apply it to their lives.

23 October 2000,Beautifully acted drama with a thought provoking theme and powerful conclusion.,"`Pay It Forward' refers to the idea thought up by eleven year old Trevor (Haley Joel Osment) as the answer to a homework project given by his social studies teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey). The repercussions of Trevor's acts are heartwarming and heartbreaking. Trevor's mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt) is trying to make ends meet as a single mom while raising her son in Las Vegas. Jay Mohr is a reporter trying to find out the origin of `pay it forward' so he can write an effective human interest article. Other seemingly unrelated characters finally fit into place as the tale winds to its powerful conclusion. Performances here are all top-drawer. The viewer will get drawn into the events which will provide an emotional reaction. It is only after the film, as you take it apart, that some of the flaws will become apparent. But by then it won't matter. Even though the final scene is a bit overdone, by then you will have been won over by the characters and the circumstances the writers have placed them in. Mimi Leder has directed the film so that the viewer can't thinking as he or she goes home of how to `Pay It Forward'. By the way, the title means to perform difficult acts of kindness for someone who needs help. Can you change the world? It certainly makes you think.",
29 May 2001,INSPIRING - IMPORTANT,"I would agree with some of the criticisms of the script mentioned by other reviewers, but I would not agree with the priority placed on those flawed moments. The overall message of the film was so filled with hope that it even got me (the eternal pessimist) to considering my part in this great scheme. Any film can be torn apart at the weak edges, but few films can claim the importance of a film such as this one. In a world where television and film have become the education tools of choice, a story that promotes this type of mindset is not only inspiring but essential to our progress as a society. Things can change and we need be reminded of that constantly. For some reason it is far too easy to forget.

13 June 2001,It was... interesting.,"I do not recommend this movie unless you like overdone emotional dialogues, because that's all this film consists of. I read somewhere that Pay It Forward was simply a bunch of Oscar Nominee clips tied together with a loose plot, and that description fits the movie very well. Not to say that Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, and Helen Hunt aren't good in this movie, because they are. It's the MOVIE that's poorly done. I was laughing out loud at the character of the black man in prison because his part was SO obviously written by a white writer trying to sound 'black' or 'ghetto' - preposterous. The entire movie is over the top and ridiculously emotional. I gave it a three because it took an interesting idea and talented actors and turned it into a laughable production. Do not watch this movie unless there isn't anything else on television - you'll regret it.

21 October 2000,"Not Perfect, but Definitely worth seeing.","What a wonderful premise for a movie. To challenge young people in what they can do to make this place a better world.

I wish, I wish, I wish, there were more actual real teachers in our public school system that appeared to care as much as the character portrayed by Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey plays a 7th grade social studies teacher who gives his students an extra credit assignment that inspires one child to make a positive difference in this world.

I know it sounds schmaltzy (is that a word?) but, for the most part, it works.

This movie will be enjoyed more by people who believe that we, as individuals, can make a difference. If you even have a shred of hope in the decency of mankind, then this movie will work for you.

The only things I would change, is one monologue given by Kevin Spacey, that I felt was unnecessary. Sometimes movie makers get nervous that the audience ""won't get it"" unless it's spelled out for them. I think this particular speech would have been more effective had it stayed subtext. Kevin Spacey is a great actor...his simple facial expressions and mannerisms tell us enough already. We don't need to know ""everything"".

And I thought the ending was sort of done....how shall we say....""neutral"". It either needed to be one way or another, but it sort of didn't come across as a strong choice.

I know I am speaking in generalizations, but you don't want to know EVERYTHING... do you?

22 July 2002,Wow.,"Wow. How else can I describe the film? The idea, well, some call it hokey. Maybe it is, and I'm a hopeless romantic, a dreamer. But maybe I'm not. What if such a simple idea COULD change the world? Why not? It's happened before. The movie is a masterpiece. The chemistry is believable, and it often brings you to the verge of tears. But those tears, if you are like me, do not fall until the end. And they fall in a rush. I have never read the book. I hope to. And I hope that I am not disappointed. Often, the movie does not do the book justice. Now, I hope that it is true in the case of Pay It Forward. Imagine. If the movie can make me cry for minutes at its end, and the book was even better. I'm not saying everyone has to like it. I just want you to keep this in mind: For those who say it won't work, tell them the Pay It Forward movement has begun. It does exist. Because of a ""hokey"" idea in a book. And the book and its idea were enough to make a compelling movie.

28 October 2000,"Promising, But Misses","The film 'Pay It Forward' could have been trimmed by roughly half an hour. The story is just fine, if too idealistic. If they had stuck with just the two central stories (the pay-it-forward idea and the romance), it would have been a tighter film. This would be a good rental if you wanted to watch something while you puttered around the house. You don't have to pay much attention to the movie to get the idea.

The way the story flashes from the past to the present is handled in a somewhat confusing way. There was no need to tell this story in such a fashion. The only reason you can follow along is because, as human beings, we can figure out which events happened when. (I thought maybe the film was shown a little out of sequence at this particular preview screening. That happens sometimes, but this was not the case.)

I keep hearing Oscar-related talk about this movie. This is a nice little story but if this is Oscar material, we are in trouble. This movie travels ground we've seen repeatedly in better films. The abused soul. The alcoholic mother. Homeless people. The pay-it-forward idea is the only twist. It's an enjoyable fantasy, but nothing more. Let's hear no more Oscar talk, 'kay?

The ending was manipulative and completely unnecessary. This really brings down my recommendation for 'Pay It Forward.' If you see this, please leave ten minutes early. You'll like it better that way.",
24 October 2000,Such a waste of talent...,"First off, I must admit that there were incredible performances from Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey. The movie seemed so promising from the beginning. Introducing each individual character in such a likeable manner, you would think that the whole movie would leave the theater with a smirk on your face. Then, you start to notice the first flaw in the movie, and you kinda let it go. Then, you start to feel really depressed because everyone starts to reveal their own personal demons... yeah, exactly. Then the most ungodly of things happen, and suddenly you feel like you've just witness Jesus dying for our sins. Do you see why it is such a waste of talent? Haley, Helen, and Kevin gave extraordinary performances for what seems to be a script geared more towards the best TV movie of the week. Utterly disappointing...

2 May 2011,"Young kid tries to change the world with the idea of doing someone a big big favour which they then have to ""pay forward"" to 3 other people","I've seen this film a few times over the years and I'm sorry but I remain of the opinion that it really is a load of rubbish. There's a great cast, Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt play the adult leads with the-then child actor Haley Joel Osment playing the 11-year-old protagonist of the story. Unfortunately their talents are under-used, with both Spacey and Hunt's roles subdued and Osment unfortunately shifted into misty-eyed heart-string-tugging mode all too often. Angie Dickinson puts in a decent cameo as a homeless alcoholic drifter but her character is slightly-sketched by the scriptwriters. Most of the key elements from the novel are completely missing or hastily - and badly - re-drawn, and to fatal effect. If you haven't already seen it, don't bother with this film, read the book instead. It'll take you longer but it's well worth the effort. This really is one of the very worst examples of what a complete pig's ear Hollywood can make of a great novel once it gets its hands on it. Even a really good cast can't save it. Maybe it can be done again in a few years, next time with a decent scriptwriting and directing team who are really up to the job and aren't just wanting to cash-in on the success of the book.",2

10 November 2000,nice try,"Human suffering always did make good entertainment. This one serves it up in spades. The film's nice little twist is its script, by Leslie Dixon from Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, which pulls us forward in time, then back again, then forward again. It's dizzying, and makes the story seem a whole lot more interesting than it actually is. For the less sophisticated viewer, it will just be confusing--and this subject matter is not exactly the kind that draws crowds of intellectuals.

Its characters, well portrayed by its dream cast (Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment, Jay Mohr, Angie Dickinson, etc.), are so genuinely Real because (I guess) their lives suck so bad. For example, Arlene McKinney (Hunt) has two jobs and an alcoholic mother who ditched her as a kid, is an alcoholic in rehab herself and a former battered wife to top it off. It's good to put characters through a lot of challenges but this was ridiculous. No one's life is this terrible.

New teacher Eugene Simonet (Spacey) gives his students an impossible assignment: make the world a better place. Arlene's son, Trevor (Osment), sees no reason he can't do it. From his initial action, feeding and clothing a homeless drug-addict (Jim Caviezel), is formed an idea: Perform conditional random acts of kindness. The condition is that if someone does something for you, you must do something nice for three other people. Trevor calls it ""pay it forward.""

Reporter Chris Chandler (Mohr) stumbles upon PIF in the film's staple-you-to-your-seat opening scene (it's great, it really is). From here he traces the phenomenon back from one person to another until he finds himself in the armpit of Las Vegas where it all began. Chandler's investigation, again, is the only reason this film worked for me. It's told concurrently with Trevor's story as it unfolds. We see the far-reaching results of Trevor's idea even as Trevor believes he's had no impact at all.

This and the ending give the film a clear message: just help one person and you already made the world a better place. Sometimes it's hard to do but that's why you have to do it. Like your grandpa used to tell you, anything that's worth having is worth fighting for...or something like that. Which brings me to the ending. Let's just day it didn't affect me the way it was supposed to. It's one of those surprises you should have seen coming, one that's supposed to be fitting. That's just the problem, though--it doesn't fit at all. I can't get into it without giving it away so I won't.

""Pay It Forward"" wants to leave you with the warm fuzzies but doesn't. No one could have done to change this. The acting, direction, writing, everything--everyone does their job well. There was no better way to do anything, not even the ending. This is just one of those cases of a project that must have looked great on paper but, upon completion, doesn't quite work.

Grade: C",5
27 August 2002,Disappointing to some degree,"I had looked forward to see this film, mostly due to the story, but also because the three lead actors are all fantastic. And the film starts out brilliantly, capturing your spirit and dissolving the world around you as you are sucked into the story line. At which stage the film lost that I'm not sure, but it did loose it. I've read many of the other comments, and it seems that many feel that the focus on the idea `Pay it Forward' was too little, giving too much time to the interaction of the main characters. This is true to some extent, though I think the film producer where trying to twin into the story line a wonderful love story. That failed, as the misery of the characters live story was just to much, with not enough substance being given to their actual characters (i.e. they were only what had or was happening to them, while having no real identity  if that makes any sense!). Some users criticize the ending, which I think was one of the better parts of the film. Good film, but easily forgettable, which I think is its greatest downfall! 7/10

1 June 2001,Kevin Spacey Rules,"If there was any doubt that Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors working today it had to be erased by his astonishing performance in ""Pay It Forward"". Compared with his work in ""American Beauty"" where he played a loser, in ""Pay it Forward"" he plays an entirely different character, a teacher (named Eugene Simonet) and he's equally convincing.

Spacey's character assigns to his class a project where they are suppose to come up with an idea that will change the world. One of his students named Trevor (played by Haley Joel Osment, in a great performance), comes up with an idea where if you help someone, that person has to help three other people, there by paying it forward. One of the people he helps is a homeless drug addict played by Jim Caviezel. Caviezel has a great scene with a woman who threatens to jump off a bridge. His line to her there will be stuck in your head for weeks. Helen Hunt plays Trevor's alcoholic mother Arlene. Hunt has some of the best scenes in the movie. Her scene in the bus station should have gotten her an Oscar nomination alone. She also has a scene where she starts to drink after she slaps her son but spits it out in the sink. She is just as good as Ray Milland in ""Lost Weekend"" and ""Nicholas Cage"" in Leaving Las Vegas. The director Mimi Leder (of E.R. mostly) knows how to stage a scene. The final one, even if you don't buy it, was certainly one of the best staged of 2000. The scene where Arlene slaps Trevor was also well done. Hunt's scene in the bus station and Spacey's outside his house shows that Leder knows how to get great performances out of actors.

Overall, Pay it Forward, was one of the most surprising movies of 2000 and it was certainly one of the best.",8
9 March 2001,Crap,"It's frankly too bad to see any project with talent such as in 'Pay it Forward' suck as much as this film ultimately does. I felt embarrassed for Hunt and Spacey--undisputedly priceless and tremendous actors--for being involved in this trite, fluffy piece of Hollywood crap. As far as the young Osment, I'm curious to see him in another movie. His performance in 'The Sixth Sense' is impressive considering his age, but Oscar-worthy, about as worthy as Gwyneth Paltrow's winning over Cate Blanchett in 1998. In this film, if he's not whimpering unconvincingly, he's busy trying (unconvincingly) to be an icon of innocence for the adults in his world to take example of. Please don't fall victim to this film's abusive attempts to manipulate your emotions with After-school special caliber traumas, dramas and tragedies...if you do fall prey to this emotional man-handling, you just may be fooled into thinking that this sap-fest makes some critical social commentaries and that all of the unrealistic events may possibly change the world. Yuck.

24 October 2000,The Best Film of 2000,"Can an idea change the world? I believe so. But what if that idea has nothing to do with getting ahead in life, or coping with life? What if it was entirely altruistic?

That's the question in this wonderful film by Mimi Leder (Deep Impact). ""The Sixth Sense's"" brilliant young actor, Haley Joel Osment delivers another jaw-dropping performance as Trevor, the 11 year old visionary. For an extra credit assignment, Trevor devises a system where people ""owe"" other people favours. They ""pay it forward"" to the next three people (sorta ala Pyramid selling schemes.)

Oscar Winners Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt back the movie with fine acting as well.

16 June 2001,offensive and depressing,"(Non-comment-related note: My sn is in no way a reference to the Goo Goo Dolls.) When I first saw Pay It Forward about a week ago, I hate to admit I was moved. I've often wished we lived in a kinder, more pleasant world. But as the saying goes, we all know what the road to Hell is paved with and just maybe this movie is as fitting a documentary as any on Highway 666. I thought the only black character in the movie was a MAJOR caricature and an insult to the fact that I have actually interacted with more than one black person my entire life, not to mention that I could be black myself. Trying to imagine how the scene where he walks down the prison corridor was directed creeps me out. Had it not been for Oscar winners Spacey and Hunt, I'm sure this movie would have never even been pitched. The best thing about this movie is the acting, which wrings whatever life it can from the script. Angie Dickinson is good with her terrible lines, but it pained me to hear her curse dressed like a bag lady. I don't think I'd say this movie has its heart in the right place, and for the sake of this ""comment"", I don't care. I can tell you, though, that I think it's emotionally exploitative, manipulative and rather ugly.",10
11 August 2001,This is not a Bad world,"Pay it foward might be give you a good sensation because you can think that if this film has been true the world could be better or you can recive a bad sensation because this is a eutopy.Haley Joel Osment is The best actor in the Film and he has got future in the great world of the films,Kevin Spacey is excellent and he´s better than in American Beauty.Helen Hunt is correct but all people knows that she get the true fame with As good it gets.The final it´s too sad and in a part I Do not understand it.

12 October 2002,Better than I thought,"With so much overhyped Hollywood fluff out there, it's often difficult to decide what will be worth your time. Even though this movie has been out for a while, I only rented it this week.

I can only say, I wish I'd seen it earlier.

You could critique it, it's not perfect, and it is sugared up a lot in many ways... but the message is worth hearing.

Exceptionally strong performances by the three main stars, along with stunning cinematography make it a treat to watch.

I really liked the way this movie portrayed Vegas. Usually, we see it in movies as a glitzy, glamorous place filled with lucky casino winners. This movie showed a dark, dirty side (every city has one), and showed that the surrounding area is beautiful on its own, without the neon flash of the casinos.

I really enjoyed it, and felt betrayed at the end... somewhat. But if you think life is always perfect and nothing ever goes wrong, maybe you need this reminder that not everything has a happy ending.

I'm surprising myself here by rating this movie as a 9. It was that good.",9
9 January 2006,What a load of rubbish!,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

13 February 2002,So so...,"Not really good, not really bad. As the movie goes on it becomes more violent, more truculent (I'm not sure if that word exists, but anyways...) and the ending is completely pointless. Trevor´s idea is impossible in real life. Maybe it could work for some people, but I don't think it could change the world. Would it end with murders, crime, terrorism, poverty? I don't think so... On the other hand the acting is great. That kid, I can't remember his name, is talented. Some situations are interesting and some scenes are touching. 5/10.

9 June 2001,"Paying it forward, now there's a thought!","Pay It Forward is one of those different movies that you wouldn't usually expect Hollywood to produce. As the movie's plot begins to stir, the viewer might think that this is just one of those lame movies about changing the world. However, that is just a premise that gets things moving.

The movie is actually a story telling of how one child's idea can have a larger affect than what the child thinks it does. It is the passion he (Haley Joel Osment) shows for his idea and the heartbreak that is caused when he believes that it has not worked.

Kevin Spacey scores, while playing an organized, scheduled person who likes things the way they have always been and does not like change. Helen Hunt gives a spark to the movie as a mother who has screwed up her life, but is so desperate to have her son love her she tries to change. Haley Joel Osment, as usual, brightens the screen with his superb acting skills.

The movie would probably be most enjoyed by those who are 13+, any younger would probably be bored with the movie. The movie does throw around a good bunch of unnecessary profanity and there is a sexual situation.

Overall, the movie ends with your heart feeling moved and your spirits are left high and low. I enjoyed it immensely. It was one of those movies that was not made known, but it should have been.

I give it 8/10",

15 May 2001,"Good, not great movie, with good performances.","I was a little disturbed by some of the comments that I read on the comments board about this film. While I recognize the film has flaws (stretched believability, the tear-jerker ending), it had plenty of strengths (a fascinating premise, a good plot, good actors). I really enjoyed watching this movie. Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osmet were excellent.

29 October 2000,It All Comes Back In The Wash,"This film has received mixed reviews from the ""critics"", probably for its ending which I did not like at all. I thought the film could have ended where it did, rather then going in the direction it did for the last 30 minutes. But overall, this was an enjoyable and thought-provoking film. No matter how far fetched the Pay It Forward idea may sound, its the idea that makes you think, Can We Change the World? Probably not, but we can make a difference in an individuals life and thats change enough for me. The idea of pay it forward, is to make a difference in the lives of 3 people, who in turn must each do something big for 3 other people and so forth. The idea looks good on paper as far as the math goes, and even in theory. It's not going to be successful with everyone, but change one person's life for the better, and thats success. Kevin Spacey is great as always to watch as well as Helen Hunt who sports a very sexy look in this film. I give it a 8 out of 10.

28 December 2000,the theme is uncertain,"You know, I'm not sure I would have seen this movie if not for the actors in it. Sam Gray is not my real name and, as you might guess, a guy that uses ""Gray"" as the last name of his alias isn't going to be much interested in cinema fluff. However, Kevin Spacey is a personal favorite actor of mine, and I've seen all of his films since 1994. I've also enjoyed Hunt's work in her better movies, and I was tremendously impressed by Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. But, this movie, along with Nurse Betty and Spacey's last film, The Big Kahuna, has convinced me that maybe actors alone aren't the thing to pay attention to when selecting a film.

But, there is some good news in Pay It Forward. Osment proves here that he's the real thing, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in Speilberg's hands for the upcoming A.I. I also think Spacey and Hunt give very good (even if occasionally overacted) performances. And the fluff isn't laid too thick, as the film is sometimes fairly depressing.

The problem, though, is that Pay It Forward isn't sure what it wants its audience to feel. Is the movie optimistic or pessimistic? It seems to want to be both, with great extreme in both directions; the ending is a wildly mixed message.

The movie's opening ten or fifteen minutes are pretty shaky, too.

Still, I must admit I found the film to be watchable, and it was more when I started to think about it afterwards that I really started to have problems with it. I credit the three leads for that, and so this film gets a higher rating from me than in probably deserves. 6/10",6
24 October 2000,Shadowlands meets The Man Without a Face,"This movie is, I agree, good and commendable for all, but a subtler script and more satisfying conclusion would improve it. Times were when you knew before entering a theater whether you would see a comedy or a tragedy. While one may doubt that the abrupt, gratuitous unhappy ending here (not Deus but diablo ex machina) rises to the stature of proper tragedy, it certainly isn't proper comedy, either. I can add nothing to what others have already expressed along these lines.

But, unless I missed something, no critic here has yet mentioned interesting parallels to two other films, The Man Without a Face and Shadowlands.

Mr. McLeod, the title character of The Man Without a Face is, like Mr. Simonet, a devoted teacher bearing horrible burn scars on his face and chest, to whom Chuck Norstadt, a boy Trevor's age and, like him, fatherless, turns for particular mentoring and deliverance. In Shadowlands, C.S. Lewis is also a formidable teacher: a renowned Oxford don and author of books on many subjects. All three teachers are refreshingly old-fashioned in their academic values and methods. The sterling character of what they staunchly purvey helps make them inspiring pedagogues.

These three men all see themselves as confirmed bachelors with little or no experience with women. Life having given them little beyond their intelligence, they have learned to ask little from it. They don't even ask for happiness as most of us define it-- only for the absence of pain, or ataraxia, in the form of sequestration from the dangers of human intimacy. They have convinced themselves that the popular song is mistaken: people who need people are NOT the luckiest people in the world. Like good epicureans, each has quietly staked a claim to a tiny plot of figurative ground, carefully tended it into a beautiful garden, and walled it off from the rough-and-tumble environs. Their epicureanism is incomplete, however, as long as they dare not look for a friend, whether man, woman, or child, whom they can invite in to share it.

From the standpoint of their leading men, this quest, at first fortuitous and reluctant, then committed irretrievably, is the theme of each of these films. There are no tangible rewards, and they all doubt sometimes that the intangible benefits of any relationship, however much they long for it, are worth the risks. Lewis becomes haltingly involved with Joy whom, together with her son Douglas, an alcoholic husband has deserted. In Justin McLeod's case, the turbulent figure is a boy himself with the same family background.

For Simonet, it is both: abandoned mother and child are obviously a package deal. Womanhood is by far the less familiar territory for him. ""I've never been here before"" he confesses to her. When she shows up in his apartment, he protests that a regular daily routine is all that enables him to cope. Her mere presence unexpectedly in his space epitomizes the upheaval that he dreads, and we can see him falling to pieces on the spot. In that many mentally ill people require very ""structured"" lives, it occurred to me that he may still be in precarious condition after time in an institution.

Mr. Simonet also hesitates to care for Trevor beyond the contractual obligations of a salaried professional. Trevor knows this well and points it out: ""you do what you get paid to do."" Mr. Simonet, for his part, tells as much about himself as about Trevor by describing the boy as exigent.

But how exigent are Trevor, Chuck, or Douglas? Their various demands are circuitous expressions of a single torment: the absence of their fathers, or of anyone else to take their place. Whether they cling to memories and fantasies like Chuck and Douglas, or whether their life depends upon facing hideous reality, as for Trevor, the prospect of parental abandonment is one of a child's worst nightmares, and for all three it has come true.

An expedient heresy is afoot in our society that fathers are optional. Too few have discussed how eloquently Pay it Forward (as well as the other two films) testifies to the contrary. Trevor was not entirely altruistic in marking down Mr. Simonet as his second beneficiary, trying to arrange a date for him with Mom. Few children in broken homes can long put out of their minds the dream that their families might somehow be made whole again. One can't hold that scheme against Trevor, as he was only working, however slender the chances, for something he deeply deserved. Protecting himself with a jocular air, Chuck Norstadt, too, once floated the unlikely idea of Mr. McLeod's taking an interest in his mother.

To me, the scenes in which Haley as Trevor reflected the progress or failure of this plan are the most effective and moving in the entire film. These range from intense curiosity (during their first encounter under false pretenses of his own devising), to the exultation of his cry ""It worked!"" early one Sunday morning when he discovers Simonet in the house, and his ebullience as the three of them merely sit watching TV, to his desperate pleading with Simonet after complications ensue. To suggest that these scenes were exaggerated or sentimental is to insult the very real, however oft repressed, anguish of a fatherless boy.

After noting similarities among three films, we must conclude with a regrettable difference. C.S. Lewis was a devout Anglican churchman, as the film showed unabashedly (and some felt that it was too restrained at that). A chapter in Isabelle Holland's book also portrayed, in no uncertain terms, McLeod as a practicing Catholic (either Anglo- or Roman). Although, alas, no such scene found its place in the film, a crucifix hanging prominently in his house proclaims the fact.

Pay it Forward, however, betrays no suggestion that Sunday morning means anything more to its characters than an opportunity to sleep late. It would have stolen their thunder to introduce any reminder that paying it forward has been going on for centuries. It is called the Church. Naturally, only someone ignorant of this tradition (literally, handing on) would see a need to invent it.",7
30 November 2001,Unfortunately disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie like for example Blade ( SO awful). This is just a mediocre movie. If you think of the talent behind it, you might say it's disappointing. The actors are great, especially Kevin Spacey, but the interesting concept of the story develops from interesting to ""why did they do it this way?"". Maybe I just had to high expectations, after all this is the first movie the brilliant Mr. Spacey did after American Beauty.

So overall not a bad movie, but gee, think what they might have done with the attached talent!!

6/10.

4 November 2000,One of the greatest films dealing with everyday life,"I just saw this films at the theaters a few hours before I am writing this and after I got back from the theater, I got completely taken by it. This film touched me humanly and emotionally. It's the sort of film that tells you that miracles can happen to you unexpectedly at any minute now. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment gave superb performances. I think they all deserve a Oscar nomination. It was really a shock at the end. On a side note, this film, to me, was sort of realistic. I was originally going to see Meet The Parents but a day before I was going to see it, a close friend of mine told me about this film and i said to myself, what the heck, I'll give it a shot and the results were outstanding. Mrs. Bist, I thank you for telling me about this movie. Anyway, if you love films that deal with miracles, then go see this film. Like Pay It Forward, Grand Canyon and Magnolia, it's the kind of films that help heal pain.

8 February 2001,Ending ruined it for me,"Without revealing too many details- why, oh why, did they feel the need to end the movie like that? It was fine, if not unspectacular, up until that point, but a good ending would have been satisfying. An unnecessary, extraneous attempt at pulling at the audience's heartsrtings went wrong, in my opinion.

30 July 2018,Kindness Between Two Strangers.,"This is what Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) comes up with for his assignment on his first day of Social Studies.

The assignment is simple:

Come up with an idea to change the world.

What Trevor conceives is an idea where instead of paying back the favors that are done for us, we pay them forward...

By finding three people in need of something vital -something they can't do on their own- and doing it for them, thus creating a chain of benevolence, and goodwill which hopefully will be perpetuated:

By the three people we've just helped, following our example.

With this in mind, he finds an indigent man (Jim Caviezel), and decides to help him out, giving him some money, and letting him sleep in his house for one night without his mother's knowledge.

When this first attempt seems to crash and burn, Trevor turns his attention to his diligent but but deeply sorrowful teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), who appears to have no one in his life who loves him, and who's face is tragically disfigured.

Trevor's mother Arlene (Helen Hunt), is a struggling young cocktail waitress in Las Vegas who's recovering from a long bout of alcoholism, and having trouble coping with her child's disappointment in her.

With a little maneuvering from Trevor, the two of them get together, and begin a relationship which, though great in the beginning, threatens to fall apart as obstacles block it's path.

Meanwhile, in what appears to be the near future (and serving as a poignant opening to the movie), an L.A journalist named Chris Chandler (Jay Mohr) is given a brand new Jaguar by a complete stranger after his own car gets destroyed.

Struck by this out of the blue event, he decides to investigate the matter further, which uncovers a chain of events eventually leading to Trevor himself.

Pay It Forward is a terrific, and refreshing movie which manages to have a little humor despite it's dramatic premise.

Everybody is good in it, and everybody seems committed to what the story has to say.

I was particularly impressed that the director was a woman, since not too many women are good at directing movies.

The ending is shocking, but is really the only good way to bring the story to a close.

Those who don't agree should see the movie again.

26 October 2000,"Buy a ticket, this one is wonderful !","Pay It Forward is a magnificent movie that you will not want to miss. ""Forward"" is an inspirational and touching movie that should garner three or more Academy Award nominations. The three main characters portrayed by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment were all acted flawlessly. The emotions you will experience while watching this wonderful movie will be more real than you can imagine. From the very start of the movie, to the all to real ending you will feel you are not just watching the show, but that you're a part of the film. Simply stated this picture is the best I have seen this year.

9 October 2000,"Lame preview, EXCELLENT movie!","Take it on faith that there's a reason why the previews are so lame. They don't want to spoil the unfolding of the plot but, because this movie has ZERO special effects (it's a drama), it's hard to pull a crowd without saying ""feel-good hit of the season"" and ""Oscar-worthy""...

Personally, my eyes glaze over when I hear those words, but after seeing it, I can say that it's all that and more and I'm glad they did it that way.

This is one of those films that make you wait before walking out of the theater so that you can find out who the director is. GO SEE IT. It's well worth the money.

25 May 2001,Sentimental schlock,"How did a fine, almost dangerous actor like Kevin Spacey get lured into doing this sentimental pot-boiler? He's very vulnerable, very closed-in, and very good as the man carrying a terrible burden of what happened to cause his disfigurement. Certainly, he's the best thing about the film. Helen Hunt -- well, I never saw her on TV, but I liked her in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Here, she just reprises that earlier role, and so maybe the answer is she can't act. Osment? What's he going to do when he grows up and there are no more roles for disturbed/gifted/special children in need of adult help? And I hated the editing. The stories did not tie together easily. This has been done much better before (Magnolia, say, but there are many examples.) Normally, I like sentimental movies, from It's a Wonderful Life to Bridges of Madison County. Thought this was a poor example.

4 February 2002,"Perfect for ""Dud Night""","If you like to get together with your friends once a week to intentionally watch a really bad movie so that you can laugh at it, pick it apart, wonder at the actors' motivations for taking their roles, guess the plot turns, eat popcorn, gossip, catch up on each others' news, etc. then this movie is a definite must-see. Be prepared to laugh long and loudly. Warning: you might linger for hours afterward wondering how Helen Hunt has a career. So go enjoy already.

31 October 2012,ABC After-School Special with alcohol,"The basic story was good. But it had about as much subtlety as an ABC After-School Special. I guess it's supposed to be for 12- and 13-year-olds. For me, it was painful to watch - really, really, really painful. Crudely directed, crudely acted. Even Kevin Spacey was pretty bad. And Haley Joel Osment was even more annoying than in ""Sixth Sense."" Apologies to those of you who liked this movie. Obviously, it's supposed to be a feel-good movie. It just heaped the feelgood on waaaaaaaaayyy too heavily, and the other emotions, too. It might be good as a remake if the director gives it some subtlety. Oh, and maybe about 30 minutes shorter.

22 September 2003,A good film spoiled by too much schmaltz.....,"I'd managed to avoid this film until two days ago, when it was the only thing on TV which I hadn't already seen. I turned to it, giving it 15 minutes before I planned to turn it off. Well, surprise, surprise, I watched it to the credits!

No, I hadn't read the book, but I had seen the fuss around it when it was first released, and I was determined then to give it a miss. The penchant for sentimentalising the pain of loss in American culture generally grates the teeth of we from the colonies in the southern hemisphere, and this film is no exception. However, it's not done to the level of cringe-making, at least not until the final scene, which for me had overtones of the end of `Field Of Dreams'.

This film was saved by three quite exceptional individual performances - those of Haley Joel Osment, Kevin Spacey, and Helen Hunt. In particular, Kevin Spacey developed his character by internalising, even withdrawing his energy, so much so that it was possible to truly believe that he'd been a victim of horrific abuse. This was a pleasant change from the eccentric and energetic performances which have become Spacey's signature. Osment, as usual, carried the role of the child with his usual mastery. Few children of his age could achieve what he did in this film.

I consider that my mild enjoyment and appreciation of this film came from the fact that I hadn't expected anything from it. It's not great in my eyes, but nor is it a turkey. I found it entertaining, while the main concept presented by the story provided plenty of food for contemplation.",
6 July 2001,Slay It Forward,"It is a rare thing indeed when a movie goes from pretty good to absolute crap in the span of a minute. However, this is the case here. I'm not going to give it away, just to say that if you see this one coming, I'll tip my hat to your psychic powers. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this.

21 October 2000,A pity...,"Pay It Forward has a great premise: take the concept of a pyramid scheme (a la Amway) but make it about giving away favors. Unfortunately, that's all the movie has going for it. I happened to read the book the movie is based on about a year ago and I thought that there was something there, somewhere, for a great movie. But the book just didn't work. It was a group of emotional and personal stories of people (great), until the third act, where the book became too ""literary"" and just drifted into complete fantasy. Also, there were a huge number of Disney elements (strange random events) in it that just wouldn't be believable in a movie. Therefore, when I found out that a movie was already in the works, I was certainly curious to see how many of the problems of the book would be resolved. I was even more curious to learn about the casting of Spacey, Osmond and Hunt. Unfortunately, the movie is as much -or more- a disappointment as the book is. At some times, it seems nobody read the book, which leads to some good and bad things. First the bad ones: - The main character of Reuben St.Clair (Trevor's teacher), was changed from a one-eye African American Vietnam -with a frightening and repulsive face-, to Eugene Simonet, a Caucasian teacher with a past history of child abuse and with a makeup that is neither scary nor repulsive. Sure, with that, you get Kevin Spacey to play it and he does a good job, but this was a role for Denzel Washington, Lawrence Fishburne, Sidney Poitier, or any other great black actor. I'm surprised noone has complained about this. - Unlike the book, here there are in total FOUR characters with alcoholic problems in the movie, which is too much. There's also TWO homeless characters, one of which is absolutely ridiculous (come on, would you let your old MOTHER be homeless?). - The beautiful story (in the book) of the old neighboring lady here is changed for the grandmother of Trevor. And you just can see the big hole in the script how this has nothing to do with Trevor's Pay It Forward plan. - The 'movement' of Pay It Forward is not seen as something taking over the world, but barely effecting one or two cities (and how this happens is confusing at best). This makes the ending and the final scene have no emotional significance. - The reporter. He is never given a good character arc as in the book and he is almost redundant. The casting of Jay Mohr (who, since 'Jerry Macguire' plays unsympathethic characters) was a great choice, but only if you brought him from being a despicable figure looking for a prize story to actually caring. - The reason for the teacher's burns.

The good changes: - The change of location to Las Vegas. It makes a much more visual setting and there's a great irony of having something extremely good come out of what is usually considered a city of sin. - The mystery surrounding the burns of the teacher. - The school violence. While this event is still heavily handed, the setup, hints and conclusion are way more plausible than what was in the book. - Some of the dialogues -since the book had no memorable ones. Although they are uneven, and almost seem to have been written by two completely people: one in tune with the material and another one not at all.

Pay It Forward is a very uneven movie and that is why the criticism will vary so much. Although I was hooked for the first 20 to 30 minutes, I started glancing at my watch by the end. There are some great scenes: the Kevin Spacey monologue introducing himself to the class, the fight between mother and son, the silent dinner eating cereals with the homeless man, the love making scene and its aftermath, etc. However, there are also some horrible ones: the revelation of Eugene's burns, Eugene and Trevor's talk on the benches and after class, all the scenes with the character of Angie Dickinson, etc. The score is very unoriginal and almost a copy of the one in American Beauty. The cinematography is competent and sometimes even beautiful during some high school scenes. Haley Joel Osment, once again, performs miraculously well while Spacey and Hunt do a decent job, but not a great one. In summary, this is a movie that would be worth doing a hopefully better remake several years from now.",4
1 August 2001,A waste of top-notch talent & great idea,"The movie, unfortunately, felt compelled to follow the novel's lead and succeeded only in wasting the abilities of Hunt & Spacey in what is essentially no more than a Made-For-TV series of artificial & blatantly manipulative plot twists & turns. It is sadly & entirely formulaic.

22 October 2000,Gets interesting responses from different critics,"As the rest of the population of this country, when I saw the cast in previews, I knew I had to see this move -- and so I did. Like expected, I cried and like expected I walked out of the theater with food for thought.

Today, I opened several sites to see what other people thought of this movie and their responses and the diversity of opinions stunned me. People said it's manipulative and it forced them to cry. So manipulation of emotion was it's biggest ""downfall"" and the great acting was it's biggest plus.

So let's think about this...Hollywood exists because it attempts to command our emotions and we all rave about it in every other review. When Titanic came out and swept the Oscars, it was BECAUSE it made everyone cry at the end and because the make up was outstanding. Somehow though, the plot of a sinking ship and a cheesy romance did not seem mundane, but the idea that a child is not being cynical of the world is lame. What conclusions are we coming to? To the idea that every single point in a movie has to be resolved and preferably with some blood so it doesn't cause anyone any tears.

What so many of us lack is the ability to feel. To feel pain and happiness and sadness. If Pay It Forward brought it out in you, why trash it? Embarrassment? Lack of ability to think about the reality of life? So many movies that were so much worse then Pay It Forward have received praises from very respectable critics, but this movie is all of the sudden is manipulative. Every movie is, because if it doesn't touch you, it didn't meet it's goal.

Sure, the screenwriters played to the emotions of the audience. Perhaps they went too far in the closing scene, but that does not make it a bad movie.

What I would like to know is why the negative outburst. If somebody knows, drop me a line.",
13 January 2002,It's worth a view...,"Just saw the movie for the first time. It's okay. HJO is a remarkable actor for one so young. The only thing I find a little unsettling about him (and this may not be his fault) is how every character he plays seems to have these long, repeated moments where he seems to have this blank look on is face. It gets old after a while. One almost wants to snap one's fingers to bring him out of it. However, as I stated, the directors most likely make him do that (for whatever reason). Oh well, when he get's a little older hopefully he'll put a stop to that. Otherwise, he's top notch.

25 March 2001,A good premise does not equal a good movie. Here's proof.,"I'm sure you've heard the premise behind Mimi Leder's ""Pay It Forward."" It's a really wonderful one. A young boy (Haley Joel Osment) gets an idea for how to change the world. Okay, maybe the premise isn't all that good, but his idea sure is. Do something really nice for three different people, and they in turn must do something really nice for three more people. Believe it or not, I've tried it. If nothing else, it makes people very happy. As far as changing the world... I don't know. Maybe.

Changing the world is just what this movie tries to do. Or if not that, at least make sure everybody leaves the theater in tears. The movie is nothing if not shamelessly manipulative. What is even sadder than this is that the actors are so good. Then again, it's sort of obvious why they're good. Two Oscar-winners plus one Oscar-nominee clearly equals Oscar, right? Wrong.

I am geniunely concerned by how sex is becoming so casual on screen. Sex as plot element is all right, or at least acceptable. (""The Graduate"" is my personal favorite example.) Sex as the obligatory thing that people do when they're in love is not. What is just as disturbing is the fact that, in the case of ""Pay It Forward"", sex is seen as being the ultimate goal of the relationship. There is a point in many films where the audience is fully aware that two people are in love. In Disney fare it's a fairly passionate kiss with a choir trying to soar in the background. Here, it's sex. Sex without commitment. Sex that, we're lead to believe, will make everything okay.

Don't get me started on the ending. It's so shameless, so unnecessary, so contrived that I could just vomit. I can picture a team of writers hunched around a table, squealing with glee as they write the last few scenes of the movie. ""This'll make those poor saps cry,"" they're saying to themselves. Well, some people cried, but I didn't. I was too busy busy being sickened.

""Pay It Forward"" ultimately possesses the subtlety and finesse of a three car pileup, except that it is possible for somebody to walk away unharmed from the latter. I've heard that ""Pay It Forward"" has a lot of Oscar buzz. I listened, and I couldn't hear it. Instead, I got stung.

** (out of ****)",
21 October 2000,Very Good,"In a year where the quality of the movies can only be described as ""lackluster"", Pay it Forward certainly shines through.

Sure, its easy to ""dis"" its Oprah-esque qualities of doing good deeds for others, but the story is fairly solid.

As I hinted to before, this year has been anything but spectacular for movies... one only has to look to recent films like Dr. T and the Women and Nurse Betty -- hailed as golden by critics -- but are really flimsy pieces of work.

Helen Hunt redeems herself in this film from her work in Dr. T, Haley Joel Osment is once again spectacular, and Kevin Spacey delivers another Oscar-worthy performance.

The score has hints of American Beauty, and I personally felt the parallels between the two films, not necessarily in mood, but in the impact they will leave behind.

If you see one film this year, spend your money on Pay it Forward, but please buy in to the concept of the movie -- just like American Beauty, one must accept the world presented in the establishing moments of the film, otherwise you'll leave disheartened.

In the meantime, Kevin Spacey, make room for another Oscar on the mantle.",10
2 September 2006,Seeking inspiration? Look no further!,"I thought movie was definitely underrated, as it was so amazing.

Kevin Spacey was great as the teacher who inspired a schoolboy to do something really incredible. Helen Hunt was brilliant as the mum, but of course, Haley Joel Osment was the one who blew me away. His performance as Trevor McKinney was incredible, along with all his other movie roles. Everyone in this movie acted really well; even Jim Caviezel and Jay Mohr gave wonderful performances, though they were short.

I loved everything about this flick, and recommend it to anyone who needs inspiration or needs to start over.

The characters were weak and flat and the only times when it seemed like they were round, were due to the acting abilities of the actors who played them. The screenplay was weak as well.

11 July 2016,"This movie confirms that ""paid"" critics get it wrong most of the time for me","Have to say that this movie is not one of my favorites, but it also is a movie that is ""on the edge"" of what pushes jaded ""professional reviewers"" over that edge.

When looking at an overall consensus of ""critics"" and ""viewer"" opinions, the actual VIEWERS opinions, those people who watch movies by choice, and not because it's ""their job"" this movie gets more positive feedback, in fact from what I can see the jaded, ""forced to watch it"" critics hate this movie.

IMDb on the other hand shows ratings based on viewers opinions and it's those opinions lately I go to for a more even handed and realistic view of whether I will like a movie. Even this movie which really is an ""over the top"" good lord this is just a bit too much to take kind of movie the score is still even handed and fair. Yes it leans past the middle into the positive but quite frankly even if you hate this type of thing it still deserves it.

I did enjoy many moments. I did wish the world could be maybe a little bit that maudlin ""sometimes"" within limits.

But overall what it shows me is that IMDb is much closer to showing me scores and reviews that match how I feel about movies compared to almost every other review site. There is some overlap of course, some movies just can't be panned even by the most jaded reviewers.

Pay It Forward is a very sappy sugary type of movie but even the worst of us enjoy that type of snack occasionally, even if we would NEVER admit it publicly.",7

3 August 2003,"Pretty good, tried to do too much","Unfortunately, the end of the movie was shameful, and just leaves a pretty good movie with a bad taste in your mouth. There were some emotional moments in the film, but the ending was pretty much ludicrous, and indicts the films integrity.

That said, you really don't want to miss any movie with Haley Joel Osment in it, and he's great again. The whole cast is pretty good, and there are many wonderful scenes. Too many really, and the movie lacks direction. There are too many good things here to not recommend the whole, but I really wish these scenes were in better hands, so the whole production would be crisper, and someone came up with a different ending. Anything. The comment someone here made comparing it to porn was spot on.

29 November 2001,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This movie has a good cast, a decent plot, but horrible direction and a terrible script. The movie was trying to be so many different things, except original. Its nice to think of paying it forward and its a pleasant idea, but the way they tried to bring it across was so bad it is comical. I had to laugh at the forced cheesy script and the pathetic stereotyping this movie showed. If you want to see an original movie with the same main actor but a good script, see American Beauty.

4 January 2020,Pay It Forward,"Many films out there inspires us and uplifts us, but there's one that moves us emotionally and inspires us deeply without a shadow of a doubt and that's Pay It Forward.

It has a lot of meaning put into it throughout the entire story, emotional, and deeply moving. Haley Joel Osment was remarkable and the entire cast was great. I recently purchase the film to keep me going on a daily basis and to keep a message shared into my life, we all need inspiration despite everyday circumstances. If you're looking for a way to keep your head up, and need something to hear and watch to not only move you, touch your heart, but emotionally-inspire you just Pay It Forward. I can write all day about this film, it's unbelievably phenomenal; A must watch!

23 January 2002,Beautiful and moving!,"I loved this movie!

My mother, my sister, and I wanted to watch a movie together. So when we heard that it would be on HBO in 20 minutes, we all jumped in front of the TV and waited. What a beautiful movie! I don't think there's anything wrong with this film, especially with the acting. I mean... with Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment (this kid is AWESOME!!!), Jay Mohr, Jon Bon Jovi, James Cavaziel, and Angie Dickinson, how can you go wrong?!

The script is very touching and well-written. The ending was especially powerful. I'm going to be 20 this summer, and I cried like a baby throughout the last 5 minutes!

Don't listen to what Leonard Maltin says. PAY IT FORWARD is an effective drama that will change the way you look at life and the lives of those around you. It certainly changed mine.",10
1 September 2004,Liked it in spite of its flaws/Wish they'd made one casting change,"I did not see this movie until it came on network television recently, and even though I can agree with all the criticisms about the disjointed structure and stereotypical characters, I bought a copy of the film as soon as I could because I wanted to be reminded of what the film could be--a discussion of what we owe the world and what we can do to demonstrate true compassion.

I thought the performances of Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment were very moving--even when the dialogue faltered. When Kathleen Wilhoite--as the Helen Hunt character's AA sponsor--came on the screen, I couldn't help but wish that she had been cast as Trevor's mother. She has a gritty earthiness and emotional rawness that I think would have served the character better. I guess the producers just felt that they had to have a big name in each of the the major roles. I guess the only chance they wanted to take was on the ending. (I think enough people have raked that over the coals--and rightly so. And, yes, I know it was in the book.)

So many other reviewers use the phrase ""What might have been. . ."" and I have to agree. With a good central idea, some powerhouse actors, and an interesting setting, it could have been marvelous--but less than gutsy casting choices; a supercilious attitude toward ""have-not"" characters; and lapses in dialogue mar it. I'll still watch it because it makes me question the status quo. I'll also always wish it had been better.",

18 May 2001,The trouble with this movie...,"I have been trying to put my finger on what is wrong with this film. After watching the movie, I knew I liked it but there was something dampering it that and I couldn't put my finger on. I read several other user comments and still didn't know. The acting was very good (for the most part), especially Kevin Spacey, and the concept of course was excellent and the story was touching, so what's wrong with it. Other users are saying it's contrived or the ending is bad or too Hollywood etc. but I can handle a bit of that and that wasn't quite it. Then, I got it. I know what the problem is, it's the directing. I wondered why in one scene, a usually talented actor would be terrible and then good in the next scene. (It's a fact that bad directing can make even the best actors look terrible.) And why the movie just didn't seem to flow. For example the homeless man helping the woman about to jump just kind of stuck there in the middle of the movie after we hadn't seen him for a while and then the scene cut off as quickly as it came. One complaint was too much of the movie taken over by the romance. Yes there was a lot of the movie devoted to the romance but they still kept the ""pay it forward"" storyline going. The problem was with how they kept it going, it just didn't flow right. It felt like they just stuck in ""pay it forward"" storyline scenes every now and then to let us know they hadn't forgotten the main point of the movie but it just didn't feel right. I blame it on the directing and whomever else is responsible for the flow of the movie. The acting is good, the concept is good, the script is good and the ending is okay, (it's just giving us some reality. If a person lives there life trying to help others, that doesn't mean that there suddenly safe from the dark side of this life.) I recommend, see this movie for the it's good points but expect to leave with a feeling that it could have been done a lot better.",8

30 December 2000,An amazing experience!,"The theory behind ""Pay It Forward"" is that of brilliance. An eleven year old boy takes a challenge set by his social studies teacher and fulfil the assignment to some amazing results. The challenge that Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey) has made goes as followed; ""Think of an idea that can change the world -- and take it into action!""

The brave eleven year old, Trevor McKinney, is played by Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense). The acting skills of the youth has already created a reputation for little Osment as an astounding thespian. But the heroic character he plays in ""Pay It Forward"" is so believable it will put you to tears. You will discover a piece of inner unity as Osment leads you to it.

""Pay It Forward"" also stars Helen Hunt as the mother of Trevor, an alcoholic struggling two jobs, an abandoned husband, and a son who avoids her offerings of love. On Arlene McKinney's journey of life she meets Trevor's Teacher Mr. Eugene Simonet. She is baffled with Eugene's mysteriously shy character. Together the two seek out to help Trevor in his theory of paying it forward.

""Pay It Forward"" was inspired Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, and is almost an exact reflection of the story. ""Pay It Forward"" tackles on various issues. This film discusses everything from domestic violence and child abuse to faith and education. It can fit anyone's choice of category.

Life is full of irony and ""Pay it Forward"" proves it. Although it may not be one of the best movies of all time, and maybe not even the best movie of the new millennium -- ""Pay it Forward"" comes close. If any movie has ever left me so intrigued, it was this one. It is splendidly acted, enchanting, and puts a positive idea on changing the world for the benefit of society.",8

The scenes with the young black male seemed like outtakes from Bamboozled II, and the big revelation scenes (the reason for Kevin Spacey's character's burns, for example), were curiously flat and uninvolving. Helen Hunt is completely miscast - I giggled every time she told Spacey that she could not understand him; this coming from an actress who epitomizes class and intelligence (I kept seeing Cher, circa Mask, in the role). And yet, as the film progressed, I found myself increasingly engrossed, entranced, and moved. The basic premise of the film, that one can make a difference in the world by small acts of kindness, the consequences of which may be entirely different from our intentions, is both plausible and reasonable, and is made completely believable by a cast working at a level of excellence that I have not seen in some time. Hunt is so good that you eventually forget the fact that she is miscast, and the other leads are equally outstanding. Jim Caviezel's open, haunted, and haunting face is a revelation every time he appears on screen, and Angie Dickinson's performance as Hunt's mother is so good that it makes one lament that she was not given more to do, in this movie, and in life. It is Dickinson's reunion scene with Hunt, in which daughter forgives mother for the neglect and abuse she had to endure as a child, that is the true emotional climax of the film. I am not ashamed to say that I burst into tears. So forgive the film its many faults, and its disgusting cheat of an ending. Despite its problems, Pay It Forward is more worthy of your time than 99% of the stuff out there right now. After all, forgiveness is the key, and the only way to break the long chain of pain, ignorance, and suffering that determines so much of life.",7
1 April 2009,"There is nothing here except a few good actors... ""I See Poor People""","I just do not understand how the actors ended up participating in such a pile of garbage. My guess is that it was sold as an intersecting drama of the ""Magnolia"" type except with an ""optimistic"" message that ended up being a near linear one note storyline.

For their part, the actors give some dimensions to a very flatly written characters. That is what bumps this rating from the lowest one star.

This movie is really as bad as the haters say it is. I cannot understand how anyone fell for it. Maybe people want to be optimistic and disliking this movie means disliking nice.

I have always been skeptical of Helen Hunt but find myself liking and believing her in most parts. My only problem with her here is her decision to participate at all ($?). The same goes for Spacey.

If you make it to the end, you will find yourself not only bored and manipulated but insulted.",
17 March 2002,Bittersweet is definitely the right word.,"Pay It Forward is one of those films for me...you know, the kind that you hear good things about for a long time, but never get around to seeing, until you see the DVD or video in a store and just buy it off the shelf on a whim, to find out that gee, all those people were right? I love this film. It features an outstanding plot, with characters that really become real to the viewer...lovely performances from Haley Joel Osment and Helen Hunt, who I've seen in other films and enjoyed watching, as well as from Kevin Spacey and Jay Mohr, who I haven't seen as often but look forward to watching. Pay It Forward is a tale that will definitely move and astonish you, and is a particularly great film to watch with a group...a thoroughly entertaining and heartfelt film.

16 August 2002,Kevin Spacey is the movie,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't.

4 August 2001,Disappointing translation to the screen,"Having just read the book upon which this film was based, I was very disappointed in seeing how much the movie changed the story. More importantly, the items changed were significant and marred the possible impact of the film on anyone who might view it.

Why was the teacher changed from black to white? Why was his name changed from St. Clair to Simonet? Why was the long period of tracking the ""Movement"" never addressed? Why was the visit to the White House not added? Why did they choose to have kids from Trevor's school stab him as opposed to his attempt to intervene in Washington, D.C.?

All in all, a very poor rendition.

24 June 2001,Sometimes you gotta take a chance,"If you want to change the world for the better, you have to take a chance. Maybe the best chance to take is to hope for goodness in mankind. This is a very well acted piece that revolves around this premise. The main actors (Spacey, Hunt, Osment) do an excellent job here. Like all good films, it has a ""magic moment""; not one I particularly liked, but important nonetheless.

Critics disliked it. Well, that's why they're called critics. A very sentimental piece with a message of hope. Highly recommended.

14 November 2000,Terrific Film,"It is not often that a child actor gives a performance the equal of the adult leads in a movie, as Haley Joel Osment does in this one. He brings the same caliber of pathos and empathy to this wonderful story as do his co-stars Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt.

Well acted, well written and edited, this deserves a second look to see if it is a greater movie than my first impression. I highly recommend it.

6 December 2001,Disappointing Second Viewing,"When I first rented this movie, I watched it throughout the day in half-hour segments or so. When it was over I hated the lame ending but appreciated the rest of it, especially the performances of the leads. I would have recommended it to anyone. A few months later, watching it a second time and watching it straight through without any breaks, I was struck by how weak and contrived the whole story really is. The first time around I was able to suspend disbelief and get into the story. This time, though, it was slow and boring and not in any way convincing, compelling or emotionally resonating. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Even Kevin Spacey's performance can't save this one from it's embarassingly forced pathos.

20 May 2001,"Excellent, except for the Hollywood ending.","PAY IT FORWARD is a well acted, well made movie, and it *is* worth watching. In a few spots, though, in pushes the sentimentality almost a bit too far, which is tolerable... until the ending which goes right over the top trying to make everybody cry but had the opposite effect on me. Then it became melodrama and sentimentality on par with James Cameron's TITANIC. Everything leading up to the unnecessary ending, though, is so worth watching that it's hard not to recommend it.

10 July 2001,Throw this one in the dumpster,"This is truly a movie for the emotionally broken. The concept is a good one, but the movie typifies the liberal's view of ""doing good."" Not only are all of the characters from broken homes but amazingly, they are the only ones that are paying it forward! Of course, some of the payments leave much to be desired. I will gladly give up the ending of this hunk of manure- The young boy that is at the heart of the movement gets stabbed to death by another youth at school. Doesn't that just fill you with delight. But don't worry, there will be hundreds of concerned, touched people to carry torches to his mother's home, in honor of this special young boy. Oh, how touching, everything will be OK now. His mother can go on sleeping with the current man of the month. Please, someone find the master print of this movie and send it to the next galaxy!

16 May 2001,Beauty & Modern Society...why are they opposites?,"This movie received mixed reviews, but this quote by the young Mr. Osment really explains it all:

I think some people are too scared to think things can be differentI guess it's hard for some people who are so used to things the way they are; even if they're bad, to change. And they give up, and when they doeverybody loses.

Plain and simple: I went through the registration process @ IMDb just so I could vote on this movie. I've seen Pay if Forward twice now, and I like it even more after watching it the second time. This movie is beautiful. If this movie doesn't touch your heart, then maybe `your ass isn't good enough to touch' the concept of Paying it Forward.

When you try and place a movie like this one with such a beautiful message onto a scale, the message is tarnished. Simply put: this movie brings a tear to the eye and warms the heart. If you're in the mood to have something make a positive effect on your life, watch this film. If not, watch a movie with drugs, guns, and whores and then ask what it is you'd like to perpetuate in this life: Kindness or Hatred.",10
8 September 2001,This movie will make you cry...,"I love this movie so much... This movie will make you cry, and especially at the end... It's a great story and a great movie. The characters were great, I like Helen Hunt's acting. She played her character very good. If someone asks me to watch it again, I would.

If you haven't seen it yet, then you better watch it or you'll miss this great story.

10 August 2001,Save your money or Pay it to Hollywood,"Don't waste your time watching ""Pay it Forward"". But don't read further if you don't want to know the ending. ""Pay it Forward"" is one of those ""from the heart"" movies - a nice story about social and personal transformations that, in this case, supposedly start with a 7th grade boy's homework assignment. Unfortunately, the credibility of the entire film is lost when someone (the writer and/or director) decided they had to hit us viewers over the head with a point, instead of allowing subtlety to slowly soak in. Worst of all, the point didn't even really have to do with the rest of the story. The story is about doing something to make the world a better place for those around you. The ending is about the debatable opinion that nothing good comes without significant suffering. Minutes from the end of the movie, as we begin to see glimmers of hope for people with difficult lives, a sudden death occurs. But the greatest tragedy is that the death didn't have to do with the story line. Did the filmmakers forget to plan the end at the beginning? After watching the entire movie and thinking good thoughts about the filmmakers' efforts, I suddenly found myself sitting through the last 5 minutes completely bored and disgusted with a tear-jerking soap opera ending that was so contrived it looked like it was borrowed from Billy Jack.",
21 October 2000,I left the theater...wanting to Pay It Forward,"I've been wanting to see this film for sometime. I enjoy Spacey and Osment respectively. Hunt is still growing on me. I did enjoy this film. I thought the concept and the message was originally put together. It felt good to see a positive movie. A good positive movie that isn't cheesy.

Osment shines as the boy with all the hope. Spacey never ceases to amaze me and continued to do so with his subtle, tense performance.

There were some problems. The score did resemble American Beauty's (but I liked it) and I did have a problem with the stereotypical black person language...It was fine but a bit stretched!

The movie seems to be taking a lot of slack for the ending but I found it logical and appropriate. And I don't think Leder put it in just to make everyone weep, even though it did just that to me. Overall, I absolutely enjoyed it. It made me feel like I needed to do something, that I could make a difference.

And if that is the intent it deserves all the praise in the world.

Osment gives another Oscar worthy performance and the screenplay deserves a nod as well.

Overall, one hell of a movie 9/10",9
10 October 2001,"didn't hate it as much as ""Stepmom""...but it was close!","Did Helen Hunt really win an Oscar not too long ago? I think she's fallen into the Cuba Gooding Jr. trap of reprising the Oscar-winning performance over and over, not seeming to notice that the first movie has ended. If she plays one more struggling single mom with a heart of gold, I'm going to have to add her to the short list of Actors To Avoid At All Costs (which currently includes Robin Williams, Melanie Griffith, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Whoopi Goldberg). It's a drastic step to take, Ms. Hunt...please don't make me do it.

""Pay It Forward"" is a relentlessly manipulative, mawkish soap opera. Everything about it is unrealistic, from guzzling vodka straight from a bottle hidden in the light fixture (doesn't it get hot?), to high-security schools with metal detectors that don't have any security guards to intervene when kids are being beaten, from a Hollywood-style homeless-people landscape of burning trash barrels and shuffling winos, to a ""Field of Dreams""-like line of thousands of car headlights making a pilgrimage toward a suburban house (where will they all park?).

I didn't believe anything about this movie, not for a second. But I tried...I really WANTED to believe in the ""pay it forward"" idea, in the inherent altruism of man. But ""Pay It Forward"" kept reminding me that it's not the concept that matters, but the ability of the marketing people can try to pack fannies into theater seats. Put together a few off-the-shelf plot ideas--a kid plays matchmaker, emotionally damaged adults find love, bullies threaten the nice kids, alcohol is evil--and wait for the box office receipts to roll in.

How easy is it to track down a homeless person in another city, based on a vague description given by a stranger? How often do kids get killed in YOUR school? Did Mom get fired from her job that required her to wear the blue wig at the beginning of the movie, or was her I-just-found-a-new-job scene left on the cutting room floor? Isn't it convenient that Jon Bon Jovi shows up at exactly the time the plot requires a relationship crisis?

""Pay It Forward"" is a bad, bad movie. Give it a wide berth.",
26 October 2000,A moving depiction of how the lives of others can be changed with the support of a great idea.,"Pay It Forward is an engaging film about a young boy's idea and it's effect on the people around him. The young boy is played by the talented Haley Joel Osment, who made a powerful impact on audiences with his role in last year's The Sixth Sense. He plays a rather normal kid here, who's biggest problem lies within the discomfort of his own family life, or lack of it. He meets a somewhat tormented man in the form of a new school teacher, played by the always brilliant Kevin Spacey. His year-long class assignment is to think of idea that will help change the world, and to set that idea in motion. Osment's mother, played by Helen Hunt, is a single mother working two jobs while fighting a drinking problem and her own shortcomings. Needless to say this doesn't allow her much quality time with her son. Osment comes up with a revolutionary idea, in the form of a pyramid scheme, to get ordinary people to go out of their way to help others. Spacey seems to see hope in the concept, but Osment finds that things don't always work out the way they should. In an attempt to improve his own life, he tries to make the scheme work by implementing it on those closest to him. The results are not perfect, but are presented in a very real manner. Pay It Forward is not exactly a feel-good film, but rather an example of how certain events can influence those around us. Osment's idea creates a sense of wonder on how things could be. The performances are strong, as one would expect, and the message is solid. The film uses a Pulp Fiction-esque style of showing events that occur before telling us how they were set in motion. The backtracking can be a bit confusing for some, but it does keep the film interesting. There are some emotional moments, and some very funny ones as well. The supporting cast helps keep the pacing strong, and the writing feels fresh and well thought out. Thomas Newman provides an interesting and moving score, which is important with a film like this. My complements to Mimi Leder, who has sculpted an insightful picture that will at the very least make you think.",
25 October 2000,Emotional blah blah blah,"There is a good idea in this movie, unfortunately instead of watching the good idea play out, we have to sit through an average little love story between deformed and disgruntled Kevin Spacey and white trash queen Helen Hunt. Although the acting is superb, as Spacey always is, and the script isn't badly written, I feel that the movie builds you up to something really interesting (especially by hooking the audience with the first scene) and then drags you through a boring love story that could happen in any movie. The film is very transparent in that it's very obvious what it's trying to make you feel and think. So if that's your thing, than see this movie.

27 October 2000,Can Hollywood Do An Authentic White Trash Movie?,"I enjoyed Pay It Forward, but not a lot. The acting by the principals is good: Spacey, Hunt, and Osment. However, I just never felt connected with it. It's a movie that just missed being better. There seems to be a problem with the structure.

Can Hollywood do an authentic white trash movie? It's as if they want their stars to look good, even though they're playing wrong-side-of-the-freeway types. The result is that the young man who Osment befriends doesn't convince me he's been on the streets. And when we see Angie Dickinson as a kind of bag lady who lives in her station wagon, we don't believe it. The place she lives with her other downside friends is not convincing. It's too pretty for being a dump. This is important, because part of the difficulty Hunt and Spacey have is about class separation. She's the so-called white trash, and he's the teacher who uses words most of us don't know. To Hunt's credit, though, she doesn't make false moves, for the most part. When she struggles with taking a drink, you sense the struggle is genuine. Her gradual improvement is also genuine.

The acting of the lesser cast members didn't make me feel they were genuine. The main problem is overacting. There's a reporter who tracks the story of the Pay It Forward ""movement"". I never felt he was a reporter. Early in the film, there's a hostage drama in the rain that's boring. The reporter drives up, bothers the police with his questions, then loses his car when it's smashed by the escaping hostage-taker. A real reporter wouldn't do that. It was a Hollywood way of getting him into the scene to lose his car. So, when his car is smashed, I don't care, and I don't really believe his emotions.

There's a young black man who pays it forward to help a girl with breathing trouble. I just never got the feeling he'd ever been behind any bars, unless he was a bartender. This seems to be a good example of how important the so-called lesser roles are. They're the world in which the principal actors operate, and they didn't persuade me.

I wasn't fond of some of the camera work. The camera would move around the face of a character for apparently no necessary reason. I was wondering, ""Why are they showing us this side of Osment's face, then the front, and then the other side?"" In other cases, they gave a new view of Vegas. It didn't look like the Vegas I've seen on visits. They didn't just take the obvious establishing shots, but did some homework.

This talk of Academy Award contention isn't justified. It's a good film that makes you think about how anybody can make the world a better place, particularly a kid. However, I got the sense that some in the audience felt manipulated, especially near the end.",5
16 October 2000,A very well done film,"I was so glad to catch the sneak preview of Pay It Forward while I had the chance. This movie was so great to watch. I love Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment, so I went to see this movie for their star power. All of the performances were excellent and should receive Oscar consideration. The story, though yes depressing at times, is very nicely assembled and masterfully told. A film that will not soon be forgotten. It's one of my favorites this year

15 November 2000,Disappointing,"While all the actors give great performances, the show didn't gel for me. In addition, the ending was far too cheesy to digest. Worth a view on video but not full price at the box office. Helen Hunt was ""brave"" for looking bad in the film, she probably looks worse than co-star Kevin Spacey, and he's supposed to look bad! But she's still too ""smart"" to be believable as a ""loser.""

21 October 2000,"""Hit over the head by an angel""","I'm sure this movie will make an enormous sum of $$$ and will also help usher George W into the White House.

However...

I'm getting awfully tired of Hollywood's idea of how regular folks live. I have a good job. Howcum Helen Hunt's character, ""struggling to make ends meet"" with two crummy jobs, owns a way nicer house than I do?

I do not buy her as ""trailer trash."" She has a very limited range. However, she had been christened as a ""quality actress"" (for having worked 6 years on a sitcom?) and so in the eyes of many, she can do no wrong. All right. Good for her.

The kid is great. I only hope there are enough good roles for him. Spacey is fine.

The story is weak; it's a slightly elevated AfterSchool Special. The characters are extremely familiar stereotypes. The only black character (Spacey's character was black in the book)is a gang member, and when's the last time you heard about Crips and Bloods? Well, you'll hear it here, along with every other Street Black Cliche they teach in Screenwriting 101. This character brings to mind Robert Townsend's ""Hollywood Shuffle.""

And the plot, well, let's see: Why is it that nobody is initially willing to reveal the Pay It Forward concept, when the whole idea of it is that the concept must be passed along in order for it to work? Nobody ""pays it forward"" to three people as required, except for the kid, with very mixed results.

The whole premise is right up the alley of the Hollywood elite: it's not enough to do good for its own sake; one must be rewarded by knowing others have done good because of you. It's redolent of the PR firms who are so quick to trumpet the celebs who donate their time to charity for no compensation--never mentioning the enormous publicity value they receive from their ""good deeds.""

The PIF movement is evidently a failure: a bag lady, a homeless guy, a lawyer and a street thug have participated in some minor ways, but it is considered a huge success. Why? Because, as always in the eyes of Hollywood, us regular folks comprehend something is worthwhile WHEN IT IS COVERED BY THE MEDIA.",
23 October 2000,No friend of Bill's,"I would fully expect Afro-Americans to decry the stereotypical depiction of the only black character in the film, while Burn Victim support groups can applaud that one of their own gets to boink Helen Hunt.

However, speaking of HH, did anyone else notice that the only way we know she had a ""drinking problem"" is because she repeatedly tells us? We never see her drunk, nor does she seem to have much trouble dealing with life; she's not a ""dry drunk"" nor is she ""white knuckling it."" She's together enough to hold down two jobs, resists the ubiquitous temptation to imbibe at work with little difficulty, she has a beautiful home, good friends, and hauls herself down to school at the slightest provocation. She also swings by the schoolteacher's apartment or parking lot whenever she needs to confront him (which she does without hesitation)--don't they heave telephones in Las Vegas? If every alcoholic was as together as she is, AA would be out of business.

8 December 2000,Why was this ending chosen?,"I know that major films are made with more than one ending and tested on audiences. Why was the ending used for this movie chosen? It turns an excellent movie into a very good one, and tainted my viewing. This story caught me up, emotionally involved me, them dumped sentimental, manipulative slop all over me in the last 15-20 minutes. Oscar worthy performances by the three leads, so I would say rent it and see for yourself. I can understand why it nosedived at the box office.

31 May 2006,Very Good Film,"I have mixed emotions about Kevin Spacey; he seems to specialize in a kind of serious ""David Spade"" character -- sarcastic and kind of smarmy. It was good to see him toned down a bit for this film. Haley Osmont is very good too but Helen Hunt is the treasure for me in this film. Not being able to stomach her on TV's Mad About You, I find her big screen endeavors very enjoyable indeed; especially when she has some meat on her bones (she has at times seemed a bit anorexic). I agree with another reviewer who would have liked to have seen more characters a la Angie Dickinson and James Carvezial. The ending did take me by surprise; I'm not sure it was necessary but afterward, I was able to relax and forgive the writer. It's good.

4 October 2001,A good Mimi Leder film,"Actually I think this is the first acceptable Mimi Leder flick so far. I've watched The Peacemaker which I found extremely boring and Deep Impact in which the special effects were good - no doubt - but the acting was very soapy. In spite of a great actor like Morgan Freeman. I really enjoyed Pay It Forward though. Good story, good plot, good acting by the whole cast.

4 November 2000,"Great actors, disappointing movie","I felt that the acting in this movie was simply awesome. You can't beat that trio when it comes to this type of movie. That being said, I must say that by the end of the movie, the plot simply sickened me. Without giving out the end of the film, we see the boy's idea developing on one front, and the romance between his mother and the teacher develop on the other front. This is the kicker. In the end, tragedy strikes, and that leaves the mom and teacher devastated. In my opinion, in the real world, no relationship could stand that kind of devastation, especially that early in the development of a relationship. But, I suppose that there are some that will see past this and say that this is one of the best they have seen. If you want to see it, see it for the acting.

22 July 2010,more than just a movie,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

2 July 2001,What is so bad about this film?,"Some of the critics were so savage in their reviews of this film (in particular, Entertainment Weekly) you would have thought that the filmmakers had commited a federal crime of some sort. I found the film to be moving and totally absorbing. So many critics complained that this film was manipulative. Their complaints might have some basis if the audience manipulations were phony and only for the sake of wringing the viewers tearducts. That was not the case. Sure the film is manipulative but in a very believable way. I can't recall one implausible manipulation in this film. Ignore those critics and do yourself a favor and see one of the best studio films to come out of a very bad year (2000) for studio films. I'll guarantee you that it's better than ""Gladiator"" and that hunk of junk won best picture. By the way, ""Gladiator"" is manipulative too! In fact, all films manipulate. Isn't that what they are supposed to do.

18 October 2000,"Great acting, good premise, awful ending","Pay It Forward has some powerhouse acting from Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and especially Haley Joel Osment. (Not to mention some brave makeup work for both Spacey and Hunt.) And the premise is pretty good, even if the script implodes during the final quarter. But the last ten minutes of this film were so manipulative, even cruel, that it marked one of the few times I left the theater angry. I really think the movie could have accomplished its goals without doing what it did. I recommend the movie, but be prepared to be put off by the finale.

25 January 2010,help someone n let someone help u too...,"Well,have we ever heard of a movie with no animations,action,big indigestible dialogues to be framed as the MUST WATCH MOVIE??Well this is the movie. PAY IT FORWARD the movie completely takes you into a very practical world where it makes it understand that how our world is in severe need of help from someone or others genuinely and if the cycle continues to help everyone how the problems will be solved easily.The most practical part ends with the last 10 minutes of the movie where we actually feels our heart broken because it actually narrates us only one simple thing and that is never SOME PEOPLE ARE TOO AFRAID OF CHANGING AND SOME WHO DOES THAN SEVERAL PEOPLE Doesn't LET THEM DO.At around with all the soberness and very gigantic display of movie an important plea can be made i.e THIS MOVIE CAN BE TAKEN INTO PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WILL CHANGE THE FACE OF THE WORLD!!!!!! Hats of to the crew of this movie including the writer who wrote the novel on it.

22 January 2001,Do yourself a favour and see this movie!,"I wish I would have known about this movie a few months back. It would have encouraged me to change my stock portfolio -- invest in Kleenex!

This is one of those ""quiet"" movies that went largely unnoticed at the box office, and by myself as well. I knew that it was superbly casted: Spacey, Hunt and Osment, but the plot seemed a little thin, if not vague. Wow, I was so wrong. I guess you can't always go by movie trailers!

Don't let this movie go unwatched. Unless you're a truly jaded cynic this movie will inspire you and harrow you to your very core.

Do yourself a favour and see this movie. Then do others a favour and pay it forward.

22 January 2002,What could they have been thinking?,"Ok. Let me start by saying I'm not close to being sexist or anything like that, but I had to double check the credits at the end of the movie to be sure. Let me explain.

I had never, ever heard anything about this movie, but I like Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, so when it came on, I sat back and watched it. I really enjoyed the story and the interaction of all 3 main leads. Then came the last 10 minutes of the film. After it was over I sat there thinking ""why, why would they put this bunch of unrealistic, Messiahnic baloney in this nice little film.""

Then I saw the credits and naturally, it was directed by a woman, the book was written by a woman, and screenwritten by a woman. I have never been subjected to more forced emotion in a movie before.

Anyway, I gave it a 6...would have been a 9 if the ending wasnt so Hollywoodized...",6

18 August 2003,Somewhat confusing and slow moving for a good portion of the movie.,"By the time Mom had finally thrown Dad out of the house, I was wondering when this movie would get to the point and end. As much as I like watching the actors involved (It was so good to see Angie Dickinson!!!), I had gotten restless enough to change the channel. However, being one to always ""read to the end of my book"", I stuck with it. I can honestly say I did not see the end coming, and I was completely blown away when it did. I am so glad now that I stuck with it.

15 July 2001,Decent Schmultz,"Mimi Leder made a nice piece here, even if it ended up being a bit more lightweight that she likely had intended. This is to be expected, of course. After all, there is little about Deep Impact or E.R. that actually ends up making much of a difference in the viewers' worldview. This is decent schmultz, unlike many of its recent cousins.

The actors put in fine performances, especially the supporting turns of Angie Dickinson and Jim Caviezel. The story line, though overly weepy at times, holds up (with the exception of the over-the-top heart string tugging epilogue) and doesn't fail to make sense of itself. The only major complaint I had was the we-know-how-to-make-you-cry attitude of the production team, primarily because they didn't know how to make me cry.

Pay It Forward is an interesting, if somewhat light, emotionally-filled film. Worth seeing.

31 October 2015,"How to make this world better, one movie at a time.","In this pre-election time, with about another year to go before we vote, everyone would like to do the right thing-- to change America and its allied powers into something better than so many of us are after living in their cultures as citizens and consumers.

Love and money are partly our inventions. Nature equipped us for both. Neither seems to be optimized yet-- for sufficient happiness-- inside or outside our imaginative dark and light entertainment products.

This story of tragic experience-- in an America desperately in need of more money and more love-- is a challenge to everyone on us. I rate it 10 for being truthful, on point, and necessary.

Is there more that is needed to improve our institutions and our habits --to reduce the origins of our conduct toward each other?

. . . Of course: a million more dramas-- many emphasizing money to end poverty, and the value of effective treatment and self-discipline to reduce violence and self-abuse.

Propaganda films aimed to reduce avoidable tragedy are something for which I would vote-- especially if they resulted in some degree of measurable success.",10

The story of Trevor is heartbreaking and uplifting. This movie had me in tears for a good 30 minutes after the credits rolled...and I knew what to expect! This movie gives you hope..

29 July 2001,"Like waiting 2 hours for pizza, then get bag of flaming poo!","This movie had alot of promise for living up to it's title. It could have ""Paid the audience forward"" with a wonderfully spun tail of local boy does good, but they forgot the title. I guess I could build up even more before I say it but it will still have the same meaning...

""THIS MOVIE ENDING TOTALLY SUCKED!!"" Never before have I viewed a movie where the ending totally enveloped all that was good about the previous 2 hours and spit it into the crapper.

That ending was like a black hole that sucked all that was enjoyable about this film into oblivion.

In this world of escalating teen pregnancy, violence and drug abuse, I think we all get about as much reality we can take during the day. And this movie didn't lack any reality for that matter, given the background of it's characters. However, I guess that just didn't wasn't depressing enough for the genius screenplay team on this one. Assuming that the book didn't contain the same overwrought ending, this thing should be totally skipped by the DVD makers and the film preservation society. Do yourself a favor, save your money and just watch the news. You'll get just as much satisfaction out of it.",
5 February 2004,I was inspired!,"Thank you, Trevor!! I believe in Pay It Forward.

The one who portrayed you may not, the cast and crew and even the novelist may not, but as for me, I believe in your Utopia. The only question I have is how many failed lifetimes will it take for those who do not believe (or harden their hearts and refuse to believe) before they come around to your way of thinking.

We all have freedom of choice, but not freedom from the laws of cause and effect and sowing and reaping.

10 July 2002,Disappointing,"I will not be lengthy, as there has been a lot of commentary. I was disappointed, increasingly, as the movie progressed.

The ""hook"" story is excellent, that is, the tale of how the ""pay it forward"" movement got started, progressed, and the reporter's hunt to find it.

The drama began, also, promisingly enough, especially considering three fine actors in the lead roles. And it was cleverly woven into the hook. As the movie progressed, however, the drama bogged down into a long strong of cliches, recited in windy boring dialogues, without a single new wrinkle. Moreover, the amount of film time given to these paper-thin personal agonies made the personal drama the primary element of the film, shoving aside the more-interesting ""pay it forward"" story.

And by ""cliches"" I mean the worst in the business. They actually could have gotten away with Helen Hunt as a single mother of a child with problems, said child being helped by a handicapped stranger striving to overcome mental problems (ring a bell?). But the gratuitous estranged wife-beating father getting a second chance and reverting to form was gratuitous and just plain irritating. The ""boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"" stuff was agonizing.

The ending was just plain awful, a pseudo-religious cop-out.",4
29 January 2002,Great . . . until the end,"As my wife and I watched this movie, we were loving it. Spacey, Hunt, Osment and Caviezel were all very, very good. The story was sweet. Real uplifting.

Then we watched the last 15 minutes - why, why, why, why, did they have to end it the way they did? There was ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO!!!

This was a 9 until the end, then it became a 6 or 6.5. A movie I would wholeheartedly recommend to everyone -> to a movie I have to think hard about recommending to anyone.

1 November 2000,A wellspring of hope,"There has been a dirth of anything that has something to say that is positive about the human spirit, that you feel that you have found an oasis in the desert with this film. Hollywood has not been a great source of encouragement to those of us who believe popular entertainment is a potent social force. It is rare that excellent acting, solid production skills combine in a film that encourages hope for the human race.

14 December 2000,Pay this film its dues,"Kevin Spacey won the academy award for the wrong movie. I can't believe such an awful movie like ""American Beauty"" would land him ""Pay It Forward"" was an extremely touching, moving and inspiring film that will touch everyone who sees it; furthermore, it is a movie that will take your breath away.

Haley Joel Osment returns to the screen with a bang. Osment portrays Trevor McKinney, a seventh grader who turns a ordinary homework assignment into a mission to change the world.

Kevin Spacey rebounds well from a disappointing ""American Beauty"" to take the role of Eugene Simmonette, Trevor's teacher. Spacey showed why he was the man for this role by taking the bull by the horns and tackling like it was just another day at the office. His performance screamed YES!!!!! this is the guy I want on my side because he was unafraid to to stand up for his beliefs and convictions as well as lend an ear to the problems that Trevor is facing.

Osment was good in ""The Sixth Sense"" but he is deserving of an oscar for ""Pay It Forward"" because he not only touches the lives of the people he helps but those who are around him with the spirit and enthusiasm he exudes in ""Pay It Forward."" Who would have thought a seventh grader would touch so many lives simply by completing his homework. Adding to this awesome movie is Jay Mohr, who plays the reporter following the story of this idea that Trevor has came up with.

""Pay It Forward"" is a movie that will stick in my mind for years to come because it contains the message that there are people places and ideas you can change to make the world a better place. This film also delivers hope that maybe if one does a good deed for someone they will in turn do one for someone else and may discontinue the violent acts.

""Pay It Forward"" is a credit to all the writers and director because the actors were able to deliver top performances with an outstanding script and direction. If I never see another movie this year I will be satisfied.

""Pay It Forward"" gets my vote for the best film of the year and my commendation for Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment. SEE IT!!!!!!!!",
3 January 2004,Interesting concept but too too corny,"Pros : -Interesting concept of Payin in forward -Very Good acting by Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt. Its commendable for these usually charming looking people look so ""scre#ed up"" and ""ugly"". -some good music -cameo by James Caviezel

Cons: -Too too corny and overly sentimental theme -Too much of Haley Joel Osment (sp?). I mean he is a good kid and a good actor but they never let him come out of sixth sense fever. He is always hushed up, sad and confused. -Cameo by bon jovi. Come on, man! Do what you do well, sing! leave acting to actors. (Actully he was better than usual in this movie but stil..) -last 15 minutes of absolutely-not-required tears and song. What? Do you have to make us cry? if yes, then hey guys!! you failed!



All in all, it could be a good watch if you like sweet, sentimental movies or are a big time fan of that kid. Or may be you have just fallen in love and whole worlds full of good sweet things for you!",5
18 November 2001,Only moves movable people,"""Pay it Forward"", the concept, is a brilliant idea. For skeptics not taken aback by it, consider that the plan takes into account the (highly likely) chance that 2 out of 3 people on this planet are scum. In fact, this is conveyed in the story, when Trevor gets frustrated doing good things for not-so-good people. The movie pits geometric growth against sustainable success rate. I liked that.

No less brilliant are the performances of Hunt, Spacey and Osment. Actually, if not for them, I might have gagged quite early into the film. The three took on a gargantuan challenge and somehow turned a sickeningly hyperbolic (read: CHEESY) script into an enjoyable, touching experience. ANY other trio in showbiz (in 2000), and this movie would be sentenced to 1001 nights of MST3k-style ridicule. It's pretty evident the film suffered from a lack of plot; it's really not much more than a great idea with a movie (complete with love triangle) built around it.

That said, I did like the movie, but I do know the difference between my taste and good quality. If you appreciate great acting and want a change from the steady diet of force-fed, cookie-cutter action flicks like ""Pearl Harbor"" (the Bruckheimer version), this movie will be enjoyable and refreshing. But aside from smatterings of awesome dialogue, the ""PiF"" concept and brilliant acting, and as much as I liked it, this movie is pretty bad. (Again, bad plot. You know, the core of a movie?)

In a nutshell: If ""Pay it Forward"" won't move you in real life, it probably won't on the screen, either.",
14 August 2001,Finally-A Great Movie,"I was beginning to think Hollywood could only make trash, car chases, special effects w/no plot type movies. But along came ""Pay It Forward."" One great movie and with a message. This young man in it did a superb job of acting.

3 November 2000,I'd see it again!,"I sometimes think people analyze films way too much and get far to technical about them (being an analytical person, I can understand that... I could get petty and say Helen Hunt lacked credibility as a drunk, etc., but that is relative). This is a movie that has been trashed by critics! Don't listen to them! I get blown away with all the trivialities they use to state their case. I feel like they missed the whole message for the few instances that might seem incredible to believe (the forest for the trees?). Who cares?

Sometimes a good movie isn't about the acting quality, or the director's vision -- it's about the MESSAGE. I think sometimes you have to just judge a movie or book with your HEART and listen to that INNER WISDOM. Forget about the technicalities! Who cares if it is filled with cliches and emotionalism? Sometimes that is what it takes to grab our hearts and help us to identify. Look at the message! Use movies like this as an opportunity for growth (yeah, yeah... I'm sounding like Oprah and some of her guests, but they've got a lot of wisdom and insight...) Sometimes it's the little things we do in life that matter most! I think that is the general point to this movie.

I think most people who trash this film are people who are generally in a hopeless negative headspace who believe the world is totally screwed up and there is NO GOOD anywhere. They would be the least likely people to do something nice for someone -- just because. (I make this statement based on the comments they've made about the movie. I have yet to meet anyone that I know -- who are good, loving individuals -- who didn't love this movie.)

I think the people who like this movie are generally good people who truly want to see change in the world we live in. This movie gives you hope that such a thing is possible with very little effort from yourself. ""Out of the mouth of babes..."" The whole thought that if someone does a ""random act of kindness"" for you, you have to just ""pay it forward"" and do 3 acts of kindness to someone ELSE.

I'd recommend it highly and all 4 of us -- the ""3 PhD's and a non"" -- would definitely see it again. We felt it's one of the better movies we've seen this year -- just on it's message alone!",9
7 July 2001,Beautiful acting makes this a standout,"I loved this film, but I am not at all surprised that the critics panned it. They don't go for films with ""heart"". I do though. To the extent that it may have been not ""realistic"" or believable enough, I think that the superb acting enabled me to suspend my disbelief. I can't add much to the compliments that have been written by others in this ""comment section"" but I will say one thing about the negative critics: They would have panned Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" when it was written.

24 May 2001,"Great movie, but the concept is not original","This is overall a good movie, the acting is believable and it is sometimes quite emotional. Especially regarding Kevin Spacey's character. Although Pay it forward seems like a novel phrase, the concept is by far not original. In fact, the concept of pay it forward as been in practice in my school for as long as anyone can remember (it goes back to the civil war days). Each year the incoming freshmen gets hazed by the upperclassmen, and they pay it forward when they're upperclassmen to the new incoming freshmen class.

16 October 2000,This movie and the acting WILL move and touch you deeply!!,"DON'T READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!

I saw this movie on Thursday and haven't stopped thinking about for a minute and it's Monday now. I'm just trying to figure out the whole point of the movie. What were the writers and the director thinking when they made this movie? How can they have so completely taken you on this incredibly wonderful, thought provoking, emotional roller-coaster ride through the entire movie, only to turn around and rob you of a meaningful message at the end!! The performance of the entire cast was phenomenal! (Osment, Hunt, Spacey & Dickenson). They all blew my mind. Genuine, real, incredible!! Unless you're made of stone, you feel what they feel and the movie totally pulls you in, then, when you least expect it, it leaves you hanging with your mouth wide open. The ending totally contradicts everything the story is trying to convey.

Soooooo, what's the point?!? If I had been the screenwriter or director of this movie, I would have never let the audience down with such an ending. For me, it destroyed the purpose and meaning of the ENTIRE movie. How can Hollywood churn out such a masterpiece of a movie; A WINNER, OSCAR, OSCAR, OSCAR, OSCAR, OSCAR... only to rip your guts out in the end. This is just my opinion and I could be wrong... BUT, I'm still wondering????",
21 October 2000,Do Watch the Movie Do the Movie,"The message is simple: Do Unto Others and Don't Expect Others To Do Unto You. You may not be able to change the world over night, but you can start it by helping others with no expectation of rewards. Bad things can happen anywhere and at any time and spreads around. So, we must do the same with the good in the world and spread it around. This movie related this message. Would it win an Oscar? Possibly, but as Haley says in the movie [paraphrasing here] ""It is not grade that I want, but the change!"" I would recommend that everyone brings tissues to this movie as it is a tear jerker. Do not wait until the video comes out because we must act upon doing the movie's message. A message worth acting upon. In a world that is...watch the movie, and you will know the rest of the sentence.

12 November 2006,This Movie Surprised me...thank god!,"At first...I did not even want to watch this movie. I thought it would be gay. I mean....what could it possibly be about..but I watched it. Thank God I did because it was a great, GREAT movie.

This movie is about a little boy named Trevor (Haley Joel Osment) who get's a new social studies teacher. This teacher is very wise. He gives them an assignment that is for ALL YEAR ROUND. The assignment is ""Think of something you can do to the change the world"" and Trevor talks about this method of ""Pay It Forward"". It is a method where you help 3 people, then those people help three people, then those people help three people, and so on.

This movie is so interesting. It is very emotional and you get a couple good laughs out of it.....plus.....Jon Bon Jovi is in it and he rocks!!!

7 November 2000,"Wonderful acting, but ""Pay it forward"" concept and human insight felt under-explored","Right off the top, I do not think this is necessarily a ""bad"" film. But my feelings about it are mixed. I fully support the efforts made by the main cast to put truth and feeling into their roles. I think the acting was all first rate, and I did care about the characters somewhat. The young actor, Haley Joel Osment, appears to have a great career ahead of him. He was really quite good. Also, it must be admitted that the story idea, ""paying it forward,"" could have been interesting.

Having said that, I think the movie was a bit shaky overall. I honestly felt like I was watching a cheesy ""made-for-TV"" special or something, apart from the good acting. The whole ""kid gets two adults together romantically thing,"" although always a crowd-pleaser, is pretty unoriginal and really cheats what could have been interesting about looking closer at how ""paying it forward"" might really have worked. I suspect that the makers of this film just couldn't see how it would work themselves, so the film takes implausible, skipping leaps in that department while we get well-tread territory over the hang-ups of Spacey's and Hunt's characters. All-in-all, not too revolutionary.

The movie really lost me at times dialogue-wise. One example is in the unconvincing homeless-guy/suicidal girl scene. Another (which is a peeve of mine) is the oh-so-typical ""if you use words beyond the eighth grade level you must be hiding behind them"" portrayal of Spacey's character. A third is when the film threw in a quick one-two punch of tragic/sublime ""touched by an angel"" moments at the end to wrap it all up. Not really all that inspiring to me...more like standard tear-jerking stuff. Finally, the score seemed like a carbon-copy of ""American Beauty,"" and grated on me. I guess we'll know when were seeing something profound from now on when we start to hear the wind chimes.

All in all I just didn't think the film was big-time material story-wise, or as an examiniation of our existence as human beings, or as far as closely examining its own ""pay it forward"" premise beyond anything superficial. But I did enjoy some of the moments between the actors and that almost makes it worth seeing on its own.

I can see why people like this film. It seems to have a good heart. And that is just fine in my book. But it also seems to have some thematic confusion, a lack of ""throughline"" with its main ideas, and some seeming emotional pandering that renders it less powerful than it might have been. A better film that explores the potential for magnanamous human behavior is Akira Kurosawa's 1950's film, ""Ikiru."" That film, to me, is a good example of how to achieve powerful human emotions without falling prey to too much overt sentimentality, but by letting it grow from the story and by activating both the ""heart"" and the ""mind.""

I give this film a 6/10.",6
21 October 2000,"Sadly, badly thought out; a waste of the wonderful Mr. Spacey.","Despite what the trailer says, this film is not an Oscar contender at all. It was a great idea that seemed to have been ill thought out by committee, with little consistent logic. The ending wholly undid any cohesiveness the plot had. The pace was slow; the story unfolded disjointedly and left you with a number of loose ends and questions. A lot of potential not explored, ending pointlessly.

Nonetheless, Kevin Spacey was wonderful; Haley Joel Osment could have been if he'd been given anything to do but scowl, pout and cry. I felt sorriest for Helen Hunt, whose character was trashy and two-dimensional. The entire script was choppy and full of undeveloped ideas and characters, alas.

28 May 2001,"Predictable, Slow, Stereotype Filled, Letdown","I was really excited to see this film, because I had heard some good things about it, and the basic premise sounded promising. Finally, I rented the DVD last night, and watched it. To summarize it briefly - the plot is incredibly predictable. I won't spoil anything plot-wise, but I was just disappointed to see that an idea that is basically great could be wasted on this film. Kevin Spacey's acting was not nearly as good as his previous films. Several aspects of the plot that are developed early (such as the homeless man that Trevor first helps) are underdeveloped or dropped altogether. They decided to focus on the little family circle of Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the boy. Parts of the movie were very slow. The thing that bothers me the most is that this is the type of plot that I usually like - so it had to be really bad to disappoint me. One thing that I noticed is that the musical score was strikingly similar - almost identical - to the score in American Beauty. That was a little annoying too. All in all... I give it a 3/10

21 October 2000,Makes me mad,"It always makes me mad when movies manipulate me into crying. I always fight it and ""refuse"" to cry. I get all fixed up with my eye make-up, then some movie like this makes me make it all a mess! I was doing pretty well in this movie at not crying until the end. So just get your Kleenex ready about half way through the movie and have it handy. Helen Hunt was very good in this movie, and I thought she was believable as a blue-collar type. I didn't like the portrayal of the teacher as such a bad dresser with the goofy tennis shoes with a suit. I teach high school, and most of the men dress ""cooler"" than that! Kevin Spacy was good too. Haley Osment was exactly like he was in Sixth Sense - I kept expecting him to say ""I see dead people."" This movie was worth the price - it's very good, but I'm glad I didn't make my husband see it - only the ""sensitive"" type men will like it. Mine likes movies like The Ladies Man and Best in Show much better. Anyway - don't forget the Kleenex!

18 June 2001,We're All Flawed,"For some reason and I cannot remember why, I thought ""Pay It Forward"" was a comedy. A few minutes into the film and I was grabbing the DVD case wondering if I was just in a bad mood or if the film was something other than what I'd first imagined.

I'll admit to having some preconceived notions about the characters in the beginning. I thought Helen Hunt was replaying the same role from ""As Good As It Gets"" and that Kevin Spacey was going to be the friendly Jr. High School teacher with a spectacle of a story behind the burns on his body to say nothing about Haley Joel Osment being the epitome of innocence and childhood perfection. Wrong, folks, on all counts.

Helen Hunt is nothing like any of her previous roles at all. She's flawed in the worst ways; alcoholic, waitress in a girlie bar, the kind who brings back the ex because she keeps falling for the line ""I've changed"" and is unable to give her son much attention. I thought Kevin Spacey's backstory would be something HUGE and, well, Hollywoodish, because, hey, he's Kevin Spacey and we have come to expect great things from him. His character, however, is just as flawed as Helen Hunts and his story is both sad and realistic in the most unHollywoodish kind of way. Osment gives another outstanding performance that only solidifies his abilities and place in cinema. They're all playing very real people here and their lives aren't pretty.

When Haley Joel Osment is given an assignment from his teacher to find some way to change the world, he ignores the smaller goals his peers set their sights on and goes for the heart and root of the people with the biggest problems he can find; his mother, his teacher and his best friend.

Supporting the main cast are Jon Bon Jovi in a small but menacing role as Helen Hunt's ex, Angie Dickinson with a surprise link that brings the story full circle and Jay Mohr, who sets the film in motion in a rather confusing beginning.

Nobody is perfect in this film and it needs to be that way. The ending looked like a stereotypical wrap-up and then quite suddenly it wasn't. Yes, you'll be grabbing for Kleenex throughout parts of ""Pay It Forward"". Ignore rumors the actors were trying for Oscars. Just watch it and allow the flawed part of all of us to breathe a sigh of relief that we're not alone.

Hats off to Mimi Leder and a cast who were up to the challenge. It was a depressing journey, but one I wouldn't have missed for anything.",
17 April 2001,"How to change the world with love, courage and determination.","One of the most wonderful movies I've seen in a long time. A boy who wants, not only his own world, but the entire world to change for the better. At his first day in 7th grade, he gets inspired by a motivational talk and assignment from his teacher (Kevin Spacey). - Then the movie just takes off. I wasn't even aware I was watching a movie. Even the child actor played so convincingly that I was totally absorbed in the point of the movie and the amazing direction that it carried me off to. - The ending provides a few tears, but I left with a smile on my face and a determination to ""take the assignment"" myself. - Not so much ""action"" for those looking for that, but the action is all in the heart. Let's all pay it forward.

8 October 2000,Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey are AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"This is the first Oscar worthy movie I've seen this year! It's a powerful story played to perfection by Helen Hunt,

Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osmet. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel good. And you will be overcome with goosebumps. It makes you wish the world would subscribe to the concept of random acts of kindness. This is a near-perfect movie...the perfection is so glearing that the excruciatingly cardboard performance by Jon Bon Jovi screams for an edit. The filmmaker could have used an off-camera sequence to replace this distracting performance. Fortunately this is a forgettable performance and you will find yourself applauding at the end of this movie!!! A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!

15 January 2001,The Academy should be looking into this movie.,"The absolute best movie I have ever seen. True, it did not do well at the Box Office and, true that it being a PG-13 limited Kevin Spacey, but I thought that all three lead actors (Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment) all did amazing, and the story was incredible. I was highly disappointed when none of the leads received Globe nominations, and I hope, though unfortunately doubt, that they receive Oscar nominations, due to the fact that this was an outstanding attempt as a moral movie, and we all know the Academy goes for movies that are completely ""politically correct"" and amoral.

22 May 2001,"Almost there, but not quite","I'm usually a sucker for a story like this. It's like a story ripped out of a ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" book and thrown on the screen. Unfortunately, ripping and throwing is about all the care and consideration that was put into this screenplay. So many elements of the story are so trite and predictable. The path that the love story would take was crystal clear five minutes into the couple's first interlude. The scene on the bridge was recycled sappiness that dates at least as far back as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And honestly, I can't think of a better example of emotional manipulation than the ending of this movie. I was surprised and disappointed in myself that I didn't see that ending coming sooner than I did.

Having said all of that, I think this movie has in its heart of hearts a noble goal. Some people are saying, ""Yeah, the kid had a nice idea and all, but that's just not the way the world works."" Well, whose fault is that? What they really mean is that that's not the way that PEOPLE work. By calling it ""the world"" they allow themselves to sleep at night feeling like there's some abstract automated mechanized system out there running and making decisions about every aspect of our environment and it would be an exercise in futility to try to oppose it. They forget or dismiss the fact that this ""system"" is set up, run, and maintained by people. That's us -- you and me. Knowingly or not, we decide how this world works. I feel like this movie is trying, however clumsily, to remind us of this fact, and it is for this reason that I hesitate to dismiss it entirely. In my opinion the film is worth seeing, but I feel like it is artistically little more than a well-acted mosaic with the individual pieces of the picture being fragments taken from films and writings of the past.",
14 February 2007,piece of crap of monumental proportions,"How could Kevin Spacey agree to do act in this trite piece of s**t???? It truly boggles the mind that he could star in this after making such jewels as the usual suspects? it's even worse than K-Pax and that's saying a lot. It is trite, manipulative, self-serving and about as subtle as Crash. It's at the top of my list of Movies That Make Me Angry, along with Chocolat, The Notebook, Story of Us... You'll love it if you're into feel-good clichés and unoriginal screenplays and movies that insult your intelligence and waste your time. Kevin Spacey should be ashamed of himself and Hollywood should stop pouring millions into crappy movies that belong on the Hallmark Channel or Lifetime.

5 October 2002,Cynical World,"I have read many bad reviews stating how foolish it is too think anyone person can make the world a better place.

We really are screwed if this world is full of cynics like that.

I believe also that was the whole reason why the child had to die in the end, is because nobody would listen, and everybody would laugh at the concept of being nice to each other and 'paying it forward'.

It is so sad, that a child must die before people will stand up and take notice of the characters ideals, dream and legacy. If he lived everyone would have laughed at the concept and called it impossible just like many reviewers have sneered.

This is the most tragic reality of the movie.

1 August 2003,One of the best dramas in years!,"I hated Deep Impact, but two long years after that director Mimi Leder popped up one of the best movies in the year 2000, PAY IT FORWORD. The movie stars two-time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey, my favourite actor (Best Supporting Actor 1995 - The Usual Suspects, Best Actor 1999 - American Beauty), Academy Award winner Helen Hunt (Best Actress 1997 - As Good As It Gets), Academy Award nominee Haley Joel Osment (Best Actor 1999 - The Sixth Sense), Jay Mohr (Jerry Maguire, Small Soldiers), James Caviezel (Fequency) and Jon Bon Jovi, my favourite singer of my favourite rock band (U-571, The Leading Man, John Carpenter Presents Vampires: Los Mortes, Ally McBeal). Spacey stars as school teacher Gugene Simonet, who asks his students to try and change the world for a school project. Young Trevor McKinney (Osment) get an idea to help three people, by doing things for them that they can't themself, and asking them to help three other people which creates a wolrdwide chain. Trevor calls PAY IT FORWARD. The people that he chooses are homeless man Jerry (Caviezel), his mother Arlene (Hunt), who is finding it hard to find a lover, and his teacher, who is finding hard to find a lover. There is an extremely powerly scene between Spacey and Hunt featuring one of my all-time favourite quotes, "" No, no! Don't tell me how sorry you are for me!

8 February 2001,By far the best movie I have seen this year and last,"The idea is so simple. Do something good to three people and then these three people do something real good to three each. Just calculate how soon the world would be reached with this simple plan.

But in the movie realism never leaves the screen. For the boy who thought of the idea (Haley Joel Osment in another splendid, Oscar deserving role) it does not work out. Worse even, the working out of his own plan will cost him his life.

The stories behind the main characters are so realistic and so brilliantly set to screen, that at times the movie shocks you and scares you. Yes, this is happening in the world. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt both deserve Oscars as well for a brilliant performance of very difficult characters.

Mimi Leder has done it again (the last movie directed by her was Deep Impact). There are no heroes here who save the world. There are people here who struggle with their past and present lives, but in the struggle find a way to do good to others, even if that means sacrificing themselves.

The way all this is presented on screen is so real, so life as it is, that it will always touch you, whoever you are and whatever you are in this world.

Thank you Mimi Leder, thank you Joel Osment, thank you Kevin Spacey and thank you Helen Hunt, for making this the best movie I have seen in the last few years. Just makes you wonder why this movie is away from the cinemas after only two weeks...........

2 November 2000,GRACE! What a concept!,"All things included this is a good movie. It is emotionally engaging. I know this b/c my husband was literally asleep when it started and within 10 was totally ingrossed. I recommend it. But there is more...

This is a movie about the concept of grace. Grace is doing something for someone who doesn't deserve it and not expecting anything in return. It may be referred to as altruism, but I think people slamming the movie for having this ""streak of unbelievable acts of altruism ce]"" are either very cynical (read HURT) or very obtuse.

The basic message I took away from the film is that, in general, life sucks, its not supposed to, so what can anyone do about it? I happen to agree with the idea that life sucks and its not supposed to. Human beings aren't terribly nice by nature(anyone who has small children can attest to this fact). We're inherently selfish. But our makeup includes a part of us that makes goodness and kindness VERY appealing. So we long to feel like we're not really bad. (My personal belief is that God made us to long for goodness, and thus search for Him, because He is all that is good)

This movie appeals to all those inherent things about us as a species. And it does it with decent acting! I've seen Spacey do better, but he's still fabulous. Hunt is growing. She is becoming the actress that I think the Academy saw in their hearts when they awarded her an Oscar. She is delightful and complex. Osmet is so good its scary. How the heck does a little boy understand the complexity of the issues he is facing and then know how to convey them without words? My husband said ,""they probably just tell him to think of something really sad."" I laughed heartily at that.

It is not a movie for kids. There were a lot of kids in the theater under 13 and I was uncomfortable with it. Too much language. But for those older than 11 or 12 I would say it is a great movie.",
28 January 2001,Complete Movie,"The last time I saw Kevin Spacey in a movie it was the much lauded, and much hyped, ""American Beauty"". I could never understand the furore surrounding this film - in my opinion it was boring and overhyped.

""Pay It Forward"" is the movie that ""AB"" should have been. There are outstanding performances all round, and a great storyline. The central idea is so simple, but so brilliant, and the way that its spread throughout the country is portrayed is very well done. If only 'pay it forward' worked in the real world!

I have read criticism of this film that the ending is overly 'smaltzy', but I can't agree - it is entirely in keeping with the rest of the film, and entirely appropriate. A great movie - don't miss it!

17 February 2001,Pseudo-critical and incredibly soppy melodrama,"Every year, it's the same situation: everybody complains (justifiably) about how basically similar and boring Hollywood's production line has become, and then along come a few interesting, innovative and critical films, and all of a sudden Hollywood is once again a symbol for all that's good about cinema. Last year, we had films like Gladiator, Erin Brockovich and American Beauty that managed to break the mould of run-of-the-mill movie-making.

And now here is Pay It Forward, one of those films that have got some critics hoping again. It's a film that can be compared to American Beauty in the way it questions and explores the substance/illusion of the ""American dream"". The idea that drives the story is a simple reversal of convention: instead of paying favours back, you pay them forward (hence the title), in this case to three lucky people. This utopian principle, invented by an innocent schoolkid (Haley Joel Osment) is applied through a variety of more or less tragic figures from the suburbs of Las Vegas.

The film is directed by Mimi Leder, one of the few women with any influence inside the studio system. She has now become the kind of director Hollywood adores: with a background in TV series, she has recently tried her hand at all sorts of genres, including the action movie (The Peacemaker), the disaster movie (Deep Impact) and now - well, what shall we call it? - a pseudo-critical and incredibly soppy melodrama.

It has to be said that the cast is excellent. Kevin Spacey, sporting heavy make-up (but, strangely enough, only in the scenes where it matters to the storyline), is, for a change, overshadowed by the recently very busy and, in this case, brilliantly countercast Helen Hunt. But the star is 12-year-old Haley Joel Osment, who has already secured his place in cinema history with the catchphrase ""I see dead people"". Sadly, James Caviezel (The Thin Red Line), an enormously talented actor, has very little screentime here, and seems to have had a lot of his footage cut out in post-production. But the interplay between these top-rate actors remains fascinating and, no doubt, entertaining.

In terms of social critique, Pay It Forward is light-years removed from the vicious satire of, say, Todd Solondz's Happiness. In this new film, important contemporary issues like alcohol, violence at school and social tensions are treated only superficially at best, and any good impressions the director might have created are completely destroyed by bolting on a cringingly sentimental ending to what is a surprisingly cold movie.

When you are immersed and emotionally involved in a movie's storyline, there is nothing wrong with a tear-jerker of an ending. But with this ultimately detached movie, the contrived ending is at odds with a film that promised a fitting conclusion to an interesting premise.

Sometimes, you just wish you could take a film back to the cutting room and banish the last few minutes to the waste bin. This is yet another example of a film that simply refuses to end. The finale is stretched out so much that it is doubtful whether even the most empathizing viewer could really be happy with it.",6
23 May 2002,Love It!,"I love this movie! It is an extremely good movie... One of Haley's best... Except the Sixth Sense... He is a great actor, in this one and all of his movies! It must have been so hard not to blink in Artificial Intelligence, which is another movie I totally recommend! The only horrible part was when he died... That was awful! Ok, I hope I didn't ruin it for other people who haven't seen it! If you haven't seen it, you have to! *Vicky*

27 October 2000,A very meaningful and entertaining movie experience!,"I really wish there were more movies created that had the depth and character that ""Pay It Forward"" has. While there were some unfortunate flaws in the direction of the movie, I can not fault the intent of everyone involved in this meaningful project. ""Pay It Forward"" has an important and vital message. In my mind, there is nothing wrong with an entertainment that forces the audience to contemplate how the world can be made into a better place. I wish that Hollywood produced more movies like ""Pay it forward.""

Critics have unfairly criticized the sentimentality of this movie and have called it manipulative. I think they have been frankly over hip in their unfairness. All storytelling is manipulative, especially whenever tugging at heartstrings is involved. So what!

I really appreciate a positive message when characters I can care about, are captured inside a story line that holds my attention for two hours. That's a treat! For me, that is money well spent. At today's high ticket price, audiences shouldn't expect less.

Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt offered tremendous multilayered performances. Young Mr Osmond is an incredible actor. He proved that his performance in ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't a fluke.

I can foresee several Oscar nominations including competing Best Actor (twice), Best Actress, and Best Picture. In what has been a weak year for great movies, it's about time we had some contenders.

I can not envision Best Director, because the direction of the movie was confusing where it didn't need to be. Telling a story with two overlaying time lines as if they are simultaneous is risky at best, and weakens the storytelling at worst. If not for this flaw I would have given ""Pay It Forward"" a perfect 10.

I won't give away the ending. All I can say is that I wish the Director had used a more subtle surgical instrument instead of a sledgehammer. Some members of the audience were practically heaving with tears.

Nonetheless, this is a highly recommended movie. Go see it.

And then please ""Pay it forward""",8
28 October 2000,Superb acting; Excellent up until the very end,"First, let me say that ""Pay It Forward"" has probably the best acting in any film this year. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment are all superb. They deliver excellent performances - what we've come to expect from them. I was particularly impressed with Hunt's performance, as she showed us a wide range of emotions - all very convincingly. Of course, Osment and Spacey did as well, but Hunt's struck me as the most genuine. The story, also, is very good. It's very believable and quite enjoyable. However, the film is not without its flaws, and the ending nearly spoils ""Pay It Forward""'s credibility. I won't tell you what it is - but if you've seen it, you know what I mean. It's completely unnecessary, and added just to get a few tears out of the audience. It's also pretty unbelievable, that what happens actually would. Not what happens after that, mind you. But the climactic point. All events that it's tied to are also unnecessary to the film, and feel like they were written in just so that this particularly bad ending could occur. No matter - ""Pay It Forward"" is still an enjoyable film with excellent performances by its 3 stars (someone's sure to at least get a nomination at this year's Awards), but the ending leaves a lot to be desired and a bad taste in one's mouth.

21 October 2000,a beautiful followup to american beauty,"i went into the theatre last night with mediocre expectations. i left, having cried 17 times. no exaggeration. Kevin Spacey was amazing and i REFUSE to ruin the ending for anyone because it is astonishing. Helen Hunt, who I have hated in the past, made me love her amazing acting ability and Haley wowed me again. The story I was sure was going to one of those big-budget made-for-tears movies that bring the women in. It was amazing. behind the idea itself was some real substance... WOW

21 October 2000,"Decent Movie, With Many Flaws","In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

18 February 2001,One of the most offensive pieces of claptrap ever!,"I know there are a lot of people who have probably been touched by this evil little film. Well, all I can say to that is -- WAKE UP! Actually, I could say a lot more but I won't. This pseudo-religious film is typical of the self-righteous malarkey that Hollywood spews out in an attempt to change a world it has no understanding of. This is one of those films filled with overstated performances, condescending portraits of ""common"" people, and probably one of the most manipulative, sickest uplifting endings of all time. If you truly want to pay it forward, tell three people not to see this sham of a film and encourage them to tell three more.

25 October 2000,Excellent film. I don't give 10's easily....,"But this film was superb, from the writing, cast and crew to the actually filming, editing work. I had not one complaint, and even with some of my favorite movies I have little nit-picky things that I would change. But, my God, I wouldn't change a darn thing in this movie!!! And I wouldn't want anybody else to play any of the roles. Kevin Spacey gets better and better every time I see the man on screen!!! And Helen Hunt really let herself go free in this role. And I don't think I even need to comment on the talent in little Haley!! Oh, and bring tissues. I cried like a baby at this emotional film!!

15 October 2000,"If you don't like sap, don't bark up this tree.","""Pay It Forward"" is the year's most pretentious movie in a movie that boasts a killer cast. It's not everyday that one can see Oscar winners Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt in a movie that also includes Angie Dickinson and Jon Bon Jovi.

This is the kind of movie where every character has some sort of tragedy. The writers try to make us feel sorry for just about every character by giving everyone tragedies. One teacher (Spacey) has mysterious burns all over his body that he won't discuss. Of course he eventually reveals the source of his burns so that we can really feel sorry for him. This overblown scene coincidentally takes place at the Oasis Motel. The symbolic irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife!

Another character is a low-class single mom waitress (Hunt) at a sleazy Vegas bar where she has to pick up extra shifts to support her son (Haley Joel Osment). There's the obligatory scene where drunken men hit on her and tease her with a tip. This is of course so we can feel sorry for her as well. Not only is she a single mother with a bad job, she's also a drunk who has an abusive ex-husband. There are plenty of scenes of Hunt rummaging through the house looking for bottles of booze. She is of course only using alcohol to escape her problems, so we can still feel sorry for her!

The story itself isn't that bad. Osment devises the ""Pay it forward"" plan of doing big favors for three people, those three people doing three big favors for three more people, and so on and so on. If the story had stayed simple, it might have worked. Instead they turn the ""Pay if forward"" plan into a phenomenon that eventually reaches a reporter (Jay Mohr), and the movie begins to get really hokey.

This is a movie where every character is so thinly drawn that I thought they might disappear. The characters are only defined by their tragedies or their vices. Other than that, they don't exist.

I won't reveal the ending. I will just say that it infuriated me as a moviegoer. It is completely insulting. The writers pull out all the stops to ensure that we really feel sorry for these people, and they go to measures that are absolutely unnecessary. They really are reaching for those Oscars. Spacey, Hunt, and Osment are given plenty of scenes to be pitiful and overstretch those acting chops. I guess the makers of this movie think that tragedies equal Oscars. The only tragedy is having a movie with a great cast that prefers to be sappy instead of smart.

My vote = 3 out of 10",3
31 October 2000,A must see. Tell 3 of your friends.,"First, let me clear something up. The ending to this movie did not ruin the film nor was it bad in any way. I know a bad ending may cause some people not to see a film, but I can't see how all these reviewers denounce it. It fit well with the plot.

That said, the rest of the film was quite good as well. The plot was carefully constructed with well placed let-downs, turn-arrounds, and climaxes. The character development was ALMOST believable. This is one of the only two shortcommings of the film. The characters change just a bit to drastically.

The second shortcomming is, unfortuntely, with Spacey. In my opinion, he fails to deliver right at the crucial climactic moment. This could just be my misinterpretation of his character, but it seemed a little lacking.

Now, don't let these two factors keep you from seeing this well done movie. All you need to do is suspend some disbelief to let these moments slip by. All in all, this is a good film well worth watching. It gives a little hope to a world which even I thought was... well hopeless.",
17 November 2000,Great movie- hated the ending!,"Pay it Forward is a great concept. I wanted so much to love this movie. The casting, the acting and the whole pretense of the film were all wonderful. Everything,that is except the tear jerking Hollywood ending. I'm sure that if they had pre-tested the ending of this film like they do with many films, e.g., Fatal Attraction, in which they shot a new ending because test audiences hated it, they would have come up with the reaction that the ending was unimaginative, contrived, out of place and unnecessary. There were so many other ways this movie could have ended better. What was the ultimate lesson of the film? If you help people your going to end up screwed? Overall worth seeing but be prepared to cry and be annoyed with Hollywood.

26 May 2002,How would _you_ change the world?,"It probably doesn't surprise anyone who knows me that I really enjoyed this movie. First, it has a number of actors I adore. Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, and Helen Hunt, in order of adoration. Second, it is (in part) about a teacher who makes a difference. I'm very much into teachers who make differences movies. Finally, the ""pay it foward"" concept has always been a favorite of mine. It immediately resonated with me when I first read it in print in the works of Spider Robinson, and I was thrilled that a movie was being made revolving around this concept. (Yes, I know about the book, but I haven't read it yet. But the concept remains the same.)

For those who abhor obviously, unapologetically sentimental movies, this is probably one for you to avoid. But for those who don't mind having the heartstrings tugged upon, this story has a number of promising elements.

Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) is an obviously physically (and almost as obviously emotionally) scarred intermediate school teacher who forces his students to think and to observe the world around them. As a year-long project, Simonet tells his class that they much each come up with a project that will change the world. At first they disbelieve, but are soon caught up in the idea. One student, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), comes up with an idea that is stunning in its simplicity. How much better of a place could the world be if you did a profoundly important favor for three different people, and instead of accepting repayment, you tell the person to pay it forward, to do their own set of three profoundly important favors?

This movie follows Trev's attempts at carrying out his own idea, which he does without explaining the project to his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt). This leads to any number of stressful situations, as does Arlene's battle with alcoholism and family tensions involving Trev's father.

I found the chronology of parts of the story (mostly those involving the reporter as he traces Trev) to be rather confusing, and actually watched it a second time to work it all out. The confusion probably came from my rather inattentive movie- watching style and not through any inherent flaw in the movie, however. =)

I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and recommend it, with the caveats included above.",9
25 November 2000,Interesting Idea,"Haley-Joel Osment portrays his character superbly and really makes you think about ""Paying It Forward"" to people you know or maybe those you don't know. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt both deliver great performances as well, and Helen Hunt changes her image as playing an alcoholic mother. This movie proves that Helen Hunt can act and deliver a great performance and not be the heroine or the character with it all together.

And I felt that having a few stories going on in the movie helped the movie's range and showed the audience that anyone can be helped and that even if they don't do it right away, most people are good and will ""Pay It Forward"" if given the chance.

I was expecting a drama/comedy/romance movie and it lived up to all that and more, I felt. Haley-Joel Osment showed in his performance that he is not a one-hit wonder and that after ""The Sixth Sense"" he can still make the audience believe in him and his character. He is one to watch in the future and I hope he eventually gets his Academy Award (I do NOT think that Michael Caine deserved it over Osment).

Overall a very entertaining movie, one with many fine performances by terrific actors. 4 out of 5 stars.",7
30 October 2000,Could have been a great movie,"The premise for this movie was intriguing, but the execution was pretty bad. The only good story line in this film was the scenes with the drug addict. Otherwise, this film seemed designed to do nothing more than to yank our chain at the appropriate spots. I walked away feeling used and manipulated.

9 October 2000,A great film!,"If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be, WOW! I thought this film was exceptional in every aspect. The acting was superb. Kevin Spacey is at the top of his game. He just has a way of picking quality films. Helen Hunt does an extraordinary turn as a trying mother of one great child actor, Haley Joel Osment, again worthy of an Oscar nod. The plot was well thought out and well conceived. Never has a movie had such a spiritually profound effect on me. It makes me want to go out and do something really nice. I recommend this film to all ages and not to give anything away, but I was so stunned. By everything that happened. A masterpiece sure to climb the charts.

7 October 2000,A fantastic movie,"Pay It Forward is one of those movies where you leave the theatre with your faith restored in modern cinema. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as usual, and I was pleasantly suprised that the role he plays here is a lot different from anything else he's ever played, in a movie that's overall different from anything else he's done.(There were shades of American Beauty, yes, but overall, different.) Haley Joel Osment continues to prove himself as a great young actor. I definitely admire an 11 or 12 year old kid who can hold his own with Kevin Spacey. Helen Hunt was good in a sympathetic but sort of nondescript role. She complimented Spacey and Osment nicely.

One of the things I loved most about this movie were its subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle allusions to the stars' previous movies. A birds-eye-view shot of the neighborhood accompanied by music that sounded a lot like American Beauty, a pool with no water in it a la Jay Mohr's 'Mafia' and especially a cameo (you have to look really hard for it) by Spacey's 'LA Confidential' costar Guy Pierce are some of the highlights. My favorite part about 'Pay It Forward', however syrupy it may sound, was that it was a movie that genuinely inspired emotions in me that hardly ever come out. I haven't cried at a movie since 'An American Tail', where basically I was 3 years old and was scared of the big cat, yet here I am, bawling my eyes out at more than one instance during this movie. (This is where I regret all the times I made fun of my best friend for crying during everything. I'm never going to live this down.) 'Pay it Forward' made me realize that everyone can change the world in their own way. I know that because of this movie, I'll never look at anyone's genorosity in the same way again.",10
27 October 2000,"Concept 10, Execution 5","Although the basic concept is an excellent one, the execution is not. In the hands of a Frank Capra, it would have been a smash. The plot goes seriously off track when so much time is spent with just one or two of the beneficiaries of the child's plan to better the world. Moreover, it's hard to believe the other characters have actually ""paid it (or anything else) forward"" because we see the child's do good attempts go awry more often than not. The audience, itself, is then required to make gigantic leaps forward to fill the gaps left by the writer. The ending left me feeling manipulated because I had no rooting interest in the particular relationship leading to it.

Despite these fundamental flaws, Haley Joel Osment, Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt do wonders with the material given them. Still, with a growing list of contenders for best acting in pictures that are also excellent, I don't see much reason to nominate them for an award, with the possible exception of a special tribute to Haley Joel Osment. In my opinion, he should have

received an award last year for his excellent performance in Sixth Sense. On the other hand, Pay It Forward's director, Mimi Leder, should receive a reprimand for misusing the talent at her disposal.",6
10 November 2000,3rd viewing and going strong,"On Wednesday, November 15 at 7pm, I will view this movie for the 3rd time in 2 weeks. The first time 4 of us went, the second time; 12. Wishful thinking perhaps but I've sent the invitation to over 200 email friends to join us Wednesday. This film is that great!

The acting is incredible, the story amazingly original but the concept has been around for centuries, and I encourage every Christian to see this movie. I just started reading the book and I can't put it down.

Reviews are fine, but see it and judge for yourself. Academy awards should go to Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, Catherine Hyde Ryan and Mimi Leder!

3 November 2000,Life changing movie,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If everyone thought the same way, things would get dull.The overwhelming majority of people who have rated and commented on this film, is ""2 thumbs up"", ""5 stars"", ""best movie of the year"", etc.

Here are my 2 cents worth. For me this was a life changing movie. I've been a Christian all my life. I've attended revivals, lay witness missions, retreats, Walk to Emmaus, and many more. This movie has impacted me in a way I never thought possible. I am a movie buff, I see hundreds of movies (both rented and box office) every year. Never before has a movie had the profound effect this one has. So much so, I will encourage the entire congregation of my church to see it. I hope we go as a group, I hope there will be spirited discussion afterwards, I thank God this movie was made.

It changed me. How many things in life can you say moved you so hard, and wasn't connected to your immediate family? This is the reason we have movies. This film is a must, must see.",10
28 February 2004,i was moved,"i had nothing else to watch.. so i was watching an 'ugly' kevin spacey telling his class to come up with something.. some idea to change the world.... and the sheer brilliant honesty came in then on... i guess, only the innocence of a child can do some things.the trio of spacey, helen hunt and osment did perfect justice. and then the end of it.. the camera moves from the empty bedroom of the kid to the poor mom and the teacher.. watching the kid's words( his interview which he gave moments before dying to save another kid from young bullies) aired on t.v. .. and well, he did his big thing.. something more than fixing up your bike... and for him.. it had finally worked !!!!.. he wasn't there to see it. well.. i cried kinda.. forced or not.. i dunno. but i cried. and the flick:i won't forget in a hurry. do please see.its good.

15 July 2001,"A great story, if only there was a script to go along with it","While ""Pay It Forward"" tries to paint a wonderful story, it is destroyed by a poorly-contrived script and an ending that will leave your head spinning -- assuming you're still awake to let it.

One of the earliest noticeable problems with this film is its lack of chronology -- it begins in the present, then switches to ""four months earlier"", then begins switching back and forth without bothering to notify you. All the while the past is catching up to the present until the two timelines finally merge toward the end of the film. The problem is that this is handled poorly; that is, it isn't handled at all. It detracts from the film in a major way; since you can't get a grip on how everything relates chronologically, it makes things that much harder to understand.

It is hard to truly grasp how the pay it forward concept got where it is. We are told that pay it forward incidents have migrated from Las Vegas (the movie's setting) to Los Angeles but we never do find out how it made it there. At first none of Trevor's (Haley Joel Osment) attempts at paying it forward seem to work, then suddenly the ball begins rolling, presumably propelled by magical fairies, since we have been shown nothing else to turn things around. People and places impacted are flashed before us but the connections to the main plot are either small or nonexistent, and many of these people are forgotten as soon as their scene ends. Just when you think you're going to learn all the connections, the scene switches. The film is not merely chronologically disjointed but conceptually as well.

There is a love story here between Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey) and Ms. McKinney (Helen Hunt), but it is one of those cases where the hand is forced by the film's adorable child, and then proceeds to take over the film. Worse, it is the predictable kind of love story, a pattern that has been used in many a movie and seedy romance novel before this one. It does not draw us in, other than a few tense moments where we learn about the characters' past. There is no emotional connection in the film that you aren't force-fed. This is script writing of the lowest caliber, when the writers are incapable of creating characters that draw out real responses and instead have to lead you around on an emotional leash. You feel for the characters only because the movie commands you to, and thus you aren't truly feeling. Well, you do feel something -- you feel used. Even more so after the ending.

Ah, the ending, which I am forced to partially spoil for you -- you might skip this paragraph. Apparently the writers realized the lack of emotion in the film, so they resorted to the classic trump card: killing a main character. I will at least spare you precisely who dies (you can probably guess anyway), but the fact that it happens has to be mentioned here. It occurs so suddenly and so out of line that you can't help but see it for what it is -- a sad attempt to salvage the movie by getting less observant people to shed some tears. As much as I've panned things so far, the movie was actually reasonably good to this point, thanks to the performances -- but throwing this needless bloodshed in killed not only the character on screen, but the entire movie. The moment is never truly built up so it becomes an artificial climax. The song that ends the film is quite beautiful, but it drew more tears from myself that whatever was happening on the screen.

The performances by Spacey, Hunt, and Osment are predictably stellar, and you might enjoy the film solely on that level. Personally, I did. But it is truly a waste of talent. The script featured in ""Pay It Forward"" is not worthy of them. It's barely worthy of Pauly Shore.

23 October 2000,Doesn't live up to the hype :(,"I saw Pay It Forward two weeks ago when it was shown as a sneak preview here in Charlotte. I had really high expectations, and over all, the movie did meet a lot of them. I was impressed by the acting of the main characters, and the story was interesting. I don't want to give away anything, but the ending ruined the rest of the movie for me! I just don't see any real reason for it to have ended the way it did, and even if there WAS some justification, did they have to make it so sappy? And that song they played throughout the final scenes was terrible. You know, I might have been able to buy the ending if they had just chosen a better song.

27 October 2000,They almost had me.,"I've seen quite a few cynical attempts to cash in on the willingness of the paying public to buy into maudlin, melodramatic, overly sentimental, dog-dies-at-the-end type movies. But brother, this one takes the cake!

Maybe I wouldn't be so disgusted though, if I hadn't nearly been taken in.

No doubts I may have about a movie, however grave they might be, can keep me away from a Kevin Spacey performance. I have never missed one of his films since being astounded by The Usual Suspects. And he does an admirable job here as a disfigured, isolated, middle-school teacher. However, it isn't enough to save the film.

Don't get me wrong. Up until the end, the movie has it's charms. Helen Hunt plays the alcoholic single mother of a bright middle school student, Trevor(Osment)who becomes infected with the semi-utopian, activist ideals of his teacher Mr. Simonet (Spacey's character). Trevor comes up with a scheme to better the world as a part of homework assignment given to him by Mr. Simonet. His idea involves helping people so that they will, in turn, help others. He puts this plan in motion by first taking in a homeless junkie, then trying to fix his mom up with his teacher. Complications ensue.

In addition to Kevin Spacey's usual awe-inspiring turn as the teacher, Hunt gives her normal performance, which can almost be described as a shtick now. It involves delivering her lines in a flustered burst of words, and trying her best to seem really, really earnest. I'll give her this, she certainly looks the part of the trashy, alcoholic, casino waitress in this movie. That's good, right?

And then there is Osment, the much acclaimed child-star of The Sixth Sense. He does an adequate job in this one, which is pretty remarkable considering the fact that he is just a kid.

In any case, all the pain, suffering, and redemption of humanity taking place here seems heartfelt if somewhat over sweet. But that is before they hit you with the below-the-belt sucker-punch in the last minutes. Completely pointless, and completely irritating.

If any less a talent than the aforementioned Mr. Spacey were involved in this inexpressibly putrid product of the Hollywood Machine, I would be tempted to write him off. Unfortunately, I am weak and Mr. Spacey is strong.

Kevin please, don't put me through this again. And, oh yeah... Shame on you.",4
16 October 2000,A Huge Disappointment,"I read another user's comments on here about ""Pay It Forward"", and just as that person said the movie ""stayed with"" them for a few days, it took ME a few days to realize fully just how bad a film this was.

Why so long? I suppose because the movie has got everything going for it- a phenomenal dream team cast, a proven screenwriter, a good director, a good concept and even a killer score (which I still think is awesome). Why would Kevin Spacey, a man with a nearly perfect track record of script selection, ever involve himself with substandard material? Well, I guess it can happen to anyone, and this proves it.

The central message of ""Pay It Forward"" -- a commentary on the innate goodness in humans and the interconnectedness of us all-- is not a new one. In fact, if you want to see a movie that covers the exact same ground but does it believably, intimately and compellingly, save some money and go rent the often-overlooked ""Smoke"" with William Hurt and Harvey Keitel from 1995. You'll be glad you did.

""Pay It Forward"", on the other hand, stumbles in delivering its message is in two areas: (1) Believability and (2) Preachiness.

Believability: Over the course of the film, a number of events happen which are enormously convenient, almost Disney-movie style coincidences and predictabilities, all for the sake of filling in holes in the plot. I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say, a block of swiss cheese looks more naturally complete than this script. Furthermore, from beginning to end we see all of the lead characters' personalities change dramatically in a very short period of time. By the end of the movie, everyone, without an ounce of therapy or even much time, is allowed to become the person we all want them to be. We all know that, especially for people as emotionally damaged as the leads all are in this movie, nothing happens overnight. But here, again for convenience, it does. Also, I was particulary offended by the ultra-stereotypical portrayal (i.e. gun-toting, sling spitting hoodlum) of the only featured black man in the film-- this movie regresses about three decades in its handling of diversity.

Preachiness: I walked out of ""Pay It Forward"" feeling like I had just watched a 2-hour advertisement for The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It's no sin to encourage people to try to be better, or to show by example, or give people a new positive way to look at life, but it can't be done in such a way that assumes moral superiority, acts condescendingly or forgets the reality of most humans, and this does all three. I could tell from the way the Hunt/Spacey relationship was handled (as with any blockbuster, it seems that they HAVE to have sex to demonstrate that they are actually in love) that this movie was pandering to the lowest, slowest common denominator, and this carries right through to the finish.

Finally, the film admits defeat by what happens at the end. As if to say, ""look, we really failed at involving you the audience in what happens up to now"", the script then has something occur that forces some emotional manipulation on us, much in the same way musicals do, where you're getting goose bumps involuntarily and hating yourself for it. I had to wait for the artificial goosebumps to go away before I realized what a missed opportuinity this movie was.",
25 October 2000,Don't listen to those reviews! Pay It Forward by watching this wonderful film!,"Wow, Wow, and Wow! Just about describes what I thought of Pay It Forward! In short anyways.

I have seen a lot of films! (Believe me!) But when I saw this one, first I knew it was with a phenomenal cast with Hunt, Spacey and of course Osment, but when it was over and credits were running, I couldn't even get up at first because I was so moved by the performances, especially by Haley, (OMG he really is a true actor!) that I was sitting there for two minutes, maybe five minutes after everyone else left, mesmerized by the film!

Kevin was excellent as Eugene! (Do you find it odd that Simonet scrambled spells Osment? Interesting!)

Hunt was excellent as Arlene and deserves plenty of recognition!

But Haley stole the show as he did in ""Sixth Sense""! And if he gets nominated as best actor with Spacey, Osment gets my vote! Don't get me wrong. I love Kevin, no doubt but Haley was so believable in this film! He's such a variety actor, he plays comedy, then drama and you can believe he stays true to his character! He creates an exquisite character in both ""Sixth Sense"" and ""PIF' but my hat goes off to him in ""PIF""! I love to see actors show a variety of emotions and expressions and Haley has the most expressive eyes that I have ever seen!

I'm am pursuing an acting career and I hope someday I can be half the talent as young Osment!

Maybe FINALLY he WILL win!

So do yourself a favor and PAY in full and see IT and after, FORWARD your life by PAYing IT FORWARD!",
8 October 2000,"Intriguing, Thought Provoking, Impressive.","The words in the title of this message are just a few among thousands that could accurately begin to describe the calibre and content of this film.

I see a lot of films, as I'm constantly visiting the local multiplex. I have to say, among the films I've seen recently, Pay It Forward had me from start to finish. Never once did I check the time. This movie is so in depth, it takes hold of your mind.

Aside from the topical intrigue, the sheer power brought on by the supreme script-writing and storylines capture you. By the end of the film, every single member of the audience was completely silent.

If you have the means, I sincerely implore you to see this film. Haley Joel Osmont, Kevin Spacey, and Helen Hunt all give Oscar-calibre performances. I really hope it earns its deserved share, come awards night.",10
14 November 2000,Rueben vs. Eugene,"Just a brief note about the film. In the novel that this is based upon, Mr. Simmonet is actually Rueben St. Clair, an African-American character. I guess all you can say is, ""That's Hollywood!"" Don't get me wrong; Kevin Spacey is great, but geez, no wonder authors feel burned by movies.

28 May 2001,This movie is junk.,"Okay, I was curious. After all, Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the young Haley Joel Osment all come with impressive pedigrees. It just goes to show that it's not always the talent, is it? The story is a poorly told one that includes almost every insipid movie cliche in the book. The ending is enough to make you ask everyone who's already seen a movie to tell you how it ends so that doesn't happen to you again. It's contrived, sloppy, and there is NO Pay-OFF to Pay It Forward.

12 May 2001,Worth the watch.,"This movie is worth the watch. The acting is great, the story is cool but the movie falls short of being hokey and stupid. The score is awesome (by THOMAS NEWMAN)! Spacey is great as usual. Hunt is very good as a drunk. Haley Osment makes the show (probably because he's the youngest and newest). But I'm sorry but Bon Jovi has never acted SO BADLY in his life! See the movie and it can either move you, or make you laugh and feel stupid to waste your money on this movie.

26 August 2006,Inspiring,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7.

25 October 2000,Good cast. Awful movie.,"Watching the commercials, I was intrigued about the ""Pay it Forward"" idea- you help 3 people, they help 3 more, in 45 days the whole world is fixed blah blah blah. Unfortunately, this idea (and even its consequences to some degree) make up about 25 minutes (maybe less) of screentime.

The rest of the movie forces you to endure lame examples of cliche societal problems (as if we didn't know there was injustice in the world): domestic abuse, drug addiction, homelessness, violence in schools, alcoholism, missing kids and even yes... kiddy porn.

My question is: WHY?

Why did Spacey's character have to be lonely AND burned? Why did Hunt's character have to be a single mother AND abused by her ex?

Why can't everyone have just ONE thing wrong?

This movie went WAY beyond what it needed to to establish the world is a bad bad place. I'm giving it a 2. This movie is terrible.",2
8 June 2001,Spare me,"The concept for this movie is fantastic. I think, however, that the plot would have been better served by less soap opera antics, less big name stars, and more realism. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt had NO CHEMISTRY on screen. Helen Hunt is being used in a role she just doesn't fit. I would much rather have seen a new actress than her again. Spacey's character is, at best, schizophrenic. He goes from strong to weak in a matter of seconds. His acting was, as usual, fantastic, but he was given a poor character. Haley Joel Osment is still an incredible actor, but they could have given the kid better lines. I kept waiting for him to say, ""I see dead people"". My opinion of this movie was much, much higher before I got to the end of the movie. Is it worth seeing? Yes, the whole concept of Paying it Forward is great. Just turn off the VCR/DVD when there are about 8 minutes left. The ending is insulting and so unrealistic it reeks of daytime soaps. Want to join the new Pay It Forward movement? Tell three people to end their viewings early. Unbelievable how they can screw up a whole movie right at the end.

16 February 2003,So close to getting it right... yet ultimately so far away.,"I knew two things going into this movie.

1) With Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment, the acting would be first-class.

2) Be prepared for the overload of sentimentality.

Thus for most of the movie I was pleasantly surprised - apart from the overproduction of tears by all characters, the lessons being learnt by these characters in the movie were not pounded into the audience with a sledgehammer as is all too frequently common in Hollywood. Instead, we are presented with a reworking of the idea of ""'do unto others as you would they do unto you"" with an added note ""even if your life sucks and things don't always work out the way you'd hoped"". This is refreshing.

Thus I was enraged at the ending. How cheap can you get? I would have preferred the typical 'happily ever after' ending to the so-cheap-it's-counterfeit ending they gave us. I won't spoil it, but I can't see how anyone finds this ending a tear-jerker, as so many appear to - I felt manipulated and the rest of the movie was cheapened immensely as a result. What message are we being given? All the way through the movie we are being told - and ably shown - that doing the right thing isn't easy, that making the world a better place means you ought to be prepared for disappointment. That's honest. But I think somewhere towards the end the makers of this movie forgot that, if they're making a movie with a larger point, it's wise to make sure everything adds up and is taken to some sort of logical conclusion. There are a few decent logical conclusions I can think of for this movie, including ones that involve ultimate disappointment for the characters - but what they came up with was just pure crass sensationalism.

This movie was apparently adapted from a book. Perhaps the producers were so unimaginative that they stuck rigidly to the structure and event of the book, rather than coming up with a more thoughtful ending. They ought to go read 'A Simple Plan' by Scott Smith, and then go watch his movie adaptation of his own book. They will see how Scott Smith completely excised the ending he wrote in the book in favour of a less sensational, but more intelligent, ending. 'Pay It Forward' would, in my opinion, have been a greater piece of work and done justice to the excellent acting performances with a similar ambiguous ending. Or just any other ending at all.

Due to my dissatisfaction with the ending, other problems in the movie that I'd ignored became magnified in my mind; for example, it is never explained how Trevor comes up with his idea of 'pay it forward' in the first place. This is a significant concept to come from an 11 year old, thus we ought to see some impetus for it. I then wondered why the one Afro-American character in the movie has to have a gun and end up in jail, like always. I then wondered why I didn't actually believe that the two main adult characters were in love, like the movie was trying to tell me. Etcetera. Ruin the ending of a decent movie, and you ruin the entire movie.",
5 January 2003,Beautiful about utopia versus reality,"There's something about this movie, that make you feel good. It's not because it ends happily - it doesn't - and it's not because it describes the world as filled of happy people that does each other good all day - it doesn't do that either. I guess it's because it's about people that makes an effort. Makes an effort to understand other people, and makes an effort to do something good beyond our everyday life.

22 October 2000,Leave the cynicism behind for a night,"The acting by the three main characters was superb. The story was fresh and original. Sure, there were a few glitches and a couple predictable lines. But overall this movie moved me like no other has in a long time, the raw emotions of those actors moving me to tears.

Cynics shouldn't even bother. For the rest of you, go and see. It's a treasure.

18 October 2000,"Pay It Forward, see it for free","I saw this movie as a sneak preview. I expected very much given all the great reviews I heard (one such reviewer was Jack Valenti of the MPAA). I'm a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and Thomas Newman (composer), and while the acting, directing and production elements of the movie are pretty solid, the script in my opinion needs a lot of work.

Some of the lines just made me cringe. Not in the way that they affected me deeply; rather I thought they were both cheesy and out of place. Kevin Spacey does a great job at covering up the script problems with his part and he fits the role really well (although I must say it wasn't one I was thrilled to see him in). Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances.

There are two notable musical interludes that I felt were not necessary. One of them I think was sung by none other than Jon Bon Jovi himself, but I could be wrong. The other was a female singer I did not recognize. These songs didn't clash with the theme of the movie, but I think film score rather than song would have been more appropriate, especially since Thomas Newman did such incredible musical work with the climactic moments in 'American Beauty'.

Someone else's review mentioned that when the name 'Jon Bon Jovi' appeared on the screen, everyone in the theater laughed. The same thing happened when I saw it. I laughed too, with good reason. His role should have been re-cast to a more competent actor.

The finale came as a surprise, and I think was a brave choice. Sure it was emotional overall, but in a cheap Hollywood sort of way. Nothing that stuck with me in the way that American Beauty did.

Overall, I give the movie 4 stars out of 10. The plot is contrived, idealistic, and a bit far-fetched. The decent acting makes up for the script problems, plot holes and shoddy, unrealistic character developments.",5
6 June 2001,View It FastForward,"The beginning was promising, interesting idea and some big names as actors. However, the longer it continued, the more it became dull and way too slow. Somehow Kevin Spacey didn't fit in his role, imo he's much better in more complex roles, like Verbal Kint or in Se7en. The kid was good, just like in 6th Sense and Helen Hunt was ok also. Some very good supporting cast thou, Angie Dickinson and James Caviezel especially and Bon Jovi wasn't nearly as bad as in U-571 and No Looking Back (those were horrible flicks anyway). Pretty watchable movie, too slow paced, but I bet most people will like this.

I can think of various alternate ways the story could have ended which would have worked better. Apart from that it was an interesting well-acted film, exploring the idea that positive deeds can cause a chain reaction, just as negative ones can.

15 October 2000,"Osment, Hunt and Spacey give powerful performances","This is a wonderfully acted, well directed film. Osment AGAIN shows tremendous range ... not just for a young actor. Spacey is riveting and Hunt is totally believable as the recovering mom.

The story is a little sappy. The ending will bother some viewers, but I think that's the point. The film could have ended differently and still had a positive impact.

The makeup is superbly done. There are several weaknesses that will not change the impact of the film.

I give it a B-.

22 October 2000,Not all world-changers are worth the attention,"It's always nice to see that someone is out to change the world for the better. As a child of the 1960s, I remember well that feeling of potential. A friend of mine then constantly wore a button reading ""G.A.D."" (for ""give a damn""). And the idea that people helping people can make a difference is noble, if not at all new.

But it doesn't seem to work here. The three main characters have far too many problems to overcome. We're distracted by scenes that switch too frequently. When the audience consciously wonders -- several times! -- if we've now gone forward or back in time, something's wrong. I would have preferred fleshing out of some of the minor characters to give some balance.

The ending seemed wrong, and made me lose my interest in the film. That's a shame, for even if it couldn't have been different (it would have to be different from the novel), it could have been more realistic.",6
7 December 2000,"Like the proverbial Chinese meal, the film left me hungry an hour later","I had such high hopes for this film, but despite stellar performances from the leading actors, the film ultimately disappoints. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but then you'll wonder why. Why were there not more scenes of folks paying it forward? Why did the film spend so much time on the romance between Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, and so little time laying the necessary ground work so that we could believe in the ending? There was a good story here, but it got lost in filmmakers attempts to win Oscars for Spacey and/or Hunt. Too bad. That said, it's still worth catching on video.

9 October 2000,I wish I'd written it...,"For nearly the entire of ""Pay It Forward"", I kept thinking ""I wish *I'd* written this..."" I still wish I had. For several reasons.

I have always thought that Random Acts of Kindness was a wonderful idea, and have tried to practice this philosophy more consciously in the last few years. With varied success, but I've definitely found that the joy is in the doing. This movie takes that philosophy to the next logical level, and the basic idea is brilliant and beautifully simple. What a wonderful idea for a story... I wish I'd thought of it!

Although the plot brought few surprises, there were many lovely moments that allowed the three main actors to display their considerable talent admirably. Haley Joel Osment makes up for a slightly rushed and sometimes flat delivery of lines with his absolutely transcendent facility to convey thought and feeling through subtle facial expression and body language.

It is not surprising that the film's youngest starring actor is so impressive. It is in the little things that one finds both the strengths and the weaknesses of this film. The little moments between the characters were wonderful... the cereal eating scene between Trevor and Jerry, for instance, was priceless. Yet the minor charactors are not developed as well as they could and should have been, and the movie would have been considerably improved had more thought and care been put into developing the secondary plotline. It could have illustrated more clearly and interestingly a point that I think got lost in the terribly cliched and somewhat frustrating ending... that it is not in the perfectly executed action that true grace lies, but in the intention and effort itself. It wasn't Trevor's successful attempt to help his teacher that touched and 'improved' the wider world - it was his 'failed' attempt to help Jerry achieve a life of sobriety. Had this story line been better developed we might have been spared the maudlin ending... Trevor (and the audience) might have come to accept that imperfect effort still is valuable, that one doesn't have to be an 'angel' to make the world a better place. I think that's a very important point to make. I wish I'd written this movie!",8

18 October 2000,"Heart in the Right Place, Film so-so","Mimi Leder gets really good ideas and great actors for films, but never really seems to deliver and this one is no exception. Unless you're heart is made from stone, you can't go wrong with this idea. It's so feel-good and innovative, but there were too many elements from other movies, ""Man without a Face,"" assorted trailer-trash movies, even the stolen shot from Field of Dreams. The characters, although well acted by the current best in the business, are only slightly deeper than ones in a soap opera and not that original. Spacey is excellent and strangely gentle but distant. Helen Hunt at times was really convincing, but other times was too glamorous. What is it with this Erin Brokoviching of our acting queens lately? The Kid, is impressive, but a little tiring. And the plot... well... I don't want to give anything away, only that the payoff is weak because it's not something that was echoed upon earlier in the film. I found myself loving the idea of paying it forward and even endeavoring to try it, but didn't like the film as much.

22 October 2000,One of the Best Movies Ever,"I don't know what these people are thinking criticizing this movie to death. They obviously have way too much time on their hands. This movie was the kind that leaves you thinking about it for days. The story was unique- something you don't see these days- and the actors did a wonderful job. Haley Joel Osment stole the show. What a great performance. You could totally see how he was stressed out at home, but when his alcoholic-abusive father got the boot, he was so much happier and at ease. His emotions covered the spectrum & he did a great job carrying them off. I found Helen Hunt & Kevin Spacey's characters very believable too as well as their performances.

Sure, there are some sappy elements and the timeline of the story is a little twisted... but if you see this film it will leave you wondering if the Pay It Forward concept could really work, or what it would take to make it successful. Very few films these days give you anything to think about or discuss when it's over. This film will do exactly that, and that's why it's worth seeing.

Different story, maybe the ending would have worked for me. But, not with this one. Spacey is a good actor. Took some pretty weak, sappy lines and made them work. Helen Hunt is Helen Hunt. You like her/you don't. I do. But Osment was really good. I think it was worth the view just to see the little guy act.

19 January 2002,"See this movie! No, really, see it already!","Haley Joel Osment finally turns in an exceptional performance, much different from his role in ""The Sixth Sense"" which made me want to fly out to Hollywood and slap him silly. I haven't seen ""AI"" yet, but I hear he was pretty good in that too. As long as he doesn't have to see any more dead people.... :)

Besides the great acting jobs from Spacey, Hunt and Osment, this movie just gets inside your head and makes you wonder what would happen if people in fact did start doing favors for strangers, to repay favors done for them by other strangers. It's a remarkable concept, and I would love to know where Catherine Ryan Hyde (writer of the book it's based on) came up with it. ""Pay It Forward"" really makes you believe that something magical is possible, and that the world isn't so bad after all. Run, don't walk to the video store and rent it today... you won't be disappointed!

23 April 2001,Pure Kitsch,"I went into the theatre with admittedly rather high expectations, because I think that Spacey and Hunt are very good actors. I'm sorry to say that the admission fee was not money well spent. The story and concept of ""paying forward"" sounds intriguing, but gets totally smothered beneath about five inches of sugar-coating. The ending is predictable, and the characters Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt play seem uninteresting, stale and two-dimensional. On the whole, a waste of time.

9 March 2002,Great story with a dark theme,"The movie has the potential to be so good with such a positive message. But instead of being uplifting it has a dark and depressing story line. So it continually lifts you up and then drops you down. Because of this seemingly internal struggle I could not rate it any higher.

5 October 2002,wow!!!!!!!,"i don't know where to start, my wife called me at work and said she wanted to rent a movie to watch that same night so i told her to stop on the way home she came home with pay it forward and boy am i glad she did. This is one of the finest films i had ever seen Kevin spacey does it again I always thought he was a fine actor but now he ranks with the best Helen Hunt also does a fine job as well but lets face it Haley Joel Osment is fantastic this young man may turn out to be the greatest of all time i exspect to see him collecting many oscars in the years too come.

13 November 2001,Fantastic!,"This was a great movie. Haley Joel is as good in this as he was in Sixth Sense. He and Kevin Spacey have true chemistry together and their characters are intriguing. Fantastic story about doing something good for other people. Although the idea is ""utopian"" (as Kevin Spacey says in the movie), it comes from a kid, so it should be. I recommend it highly! 9 out of 10.

26 November 2016,IMDb Rating,"Someone does you a good favor. You pass it on to three other people. They pass it on. And what a wonderful world this will be like the commercial we see on TV these days. That's the theory behind ""Pay It Forward,"". I would like to say this is a great movie for kids, and parents but parents should be cautious while watching with their kids under 14 years old. This movie has frequent profanity, including one use of the ""N"" word, as well as a tween boy who calls one of his bullies ""a fag."" Many of the characters abuse alcohol and drugs, including heroin and marijuana. There are references to severe domestic abuse. There are some fights, one resulting in mortal injury. A character attempts suicide. Another shoots his gun, though no one is injured. A character dies tragically. I personally think this movie deserves more than 7.2 rating. This is a must seen movie for all kids, and parents to raise a better generation.

27 October 2005,Open hearted inspiration,"I really enjoyed this film. The acting was superb from all sides. Kevin Spacy and Helen Hunt are especially good as they work through their feeling and their pasts.

This film impressed me because it was simple yet effective. It managed to convey it's simple message of hope in humanity and the value of giving without preaching or even talking about it much. It really touched me when Trevor feels like he has failed in his attempt to change the world.

The end of this film is shocking, but also deeply moving. I was in tears at the true extent of the impact that Trevor's project has.

Watch it with an open heart - if you do you'll be inspired.

9 June 2001,The best movie I have seen in years,"Wow, I was stunned by this movie. It slowly sucks you in and then at the end, POW, hand me a Kleenex please. Not a dry eye in our house watching this one. The idea is so simple but what if people really started paying forward, what a different would we would live in. Again, this movie goes to show that a lot of sex and violence are not necessary for a movie to be a hit, at least with a certain segment of society that have grown weary of those kinds of movies.

8 October 2000,"Inspiring Idea, Competent Execution","The concept is bold and the potential for failure is great. With any ""you can change the world"" movie, the result can be grand or grating, holy or hokey. Mimi Leder's effort (which at least proves she should be doing this type of film, as opposed to ""The Peacemaker"") is well shaped, thanks to an adapted script with heavy doses of realism, a key requirement for this story's success.

As expected from three recent Oscar favorites (Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment), the performances are tight, especially a bionic performance from Angie Dickinson. The soundtrack would have been hauntingly beautiful, if it wasn't so similar to the soundtrack for ""American Beauty."" Instead, it was distracting and overused. Some directorial moves are false, particularly the ending shot's ""Field of Dreams"" rip-off, but ultimately audiences will embrace this film thanks to everyone's effort.

22 October 2000,Little Pay off....,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

2 February 2001,Don't believe the newspaper movie critics...,"Yet another reason to disregard the reviews by paid newspaper critics. Although there were moments where the dialogue was in need of a serious rewrite, the film itself was very good. The ending (no spoiler here) was not the ""typical Hollywood, test marketed ending"" and perhaps that was the reason for the horrific reviews in the Los Angeles Times and others... but see for yourself just how wonderful Haley Joel Osment is, and keep in mind that this is VERY REAL and true to life. Sometimes bad things do happen for good reasons in this world, and that is the morality behind the film.

The casting of Helen Hunt left something to be desired. She is the wrong choice for an alcoholic mess of a woman, but that is probably the biggest fault of the film (except those dreaded bad-writing moments, of which there are few) so, sit back, enjoy the film and remember that one plus one plus one can change the world...

23 October 2000,A tug-of-war between emotions and criticism,"It's really hard to say something bad about a movie as promising as Pay It Forward. An all-star cast including Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, The Usual Suspects), Helen Hunt (As Good As It Gets) and Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) means a high concentration of acting power and just as much Oscar buzz. Mixed reviews and the five-month span until the Academy Awards may sink the chances of what are some of the year's best performances.

Eugene Simonet (Spacey) is a physically and mentally scarred middle school teacher who proposes a special extra credit assignment for his class: They are each to come up with a way to change the world and put it into action throughout the course of the school year. Enter Trevor McKinney (Osment), a soulfully naïve 11-year-old who invents 'pay it forward'. Do something big for three people, something they can't do for themselves, and instead of paying it back, they pay it forward to three others, and so on, effectively starting a chain reaction that would spread like wildfire.

As Trevor begins to put his plan to work, the dark forces of opposition begin to emerge and give the story a painfully real sense of the world as it is. Trevor seemingly fails again and again and again. Through his arguments with his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt) and his pleading with his teacher, Trevor slowly begins to give up hope.

Meanwhile, 'pay it forward' has begun to pop up in major cities and soon falls into the lap of Chris Carpenter (Jay Mohr), a freelance reporter. When Chris's car is destroyed, a gentleman throws him the keys to his Jaguar and insists he takes it. Chris begins to trace these occurrences of selflessness, and is continually enlightened in his journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

Pay It Forward is marketed much differently than how the movie actually falls together, though. Outwardly it is a do good, feel good, moral type of film. But make no mistake. Pay It Forward is a heavy-handed, gut-wrenching, and often manipulative tearjerker. And although the performances are incredible by all, Pay It Forward as a story does not provide the two hours of escape from real life that most people are looking for. Instead, it immerses its audience in some of the most painful parts of it. I was literally in a state of semi-shock as I walked out of the theater , not knowing exactly to make of it all, and still find myself rummaging through different scenes in my mind.

This movie is definitely not for everyone. It requires a lot of heart and soul, a little patience and an open mind. A spin-cycle of emotions, Pay It Forward is more of a life lesson than a movie and depending on your point of view, will leave you with either an empty box of tissues or a 10 minute 'I-want-a-refund' conversation with the theater manager. Personally, I found myself in a tug-of-war between emotions and criticism.

Rating: 3 ½ of 5 stars (7 of 10)",7
12 July 2001,"Predictable, sappy, poorly produced pap!","If you can't decide whether to watch this movie or go to bed, choose go to bed. What a waste of time. I couldn't believe any of the actors. The production values were like bad made-for-TV movies. The situations were so poorly acted, scripted and produced that I couldn't for a minute believe any of them. Phooey!

22 October 2000,I'm still a little weepy,"I never really cry at movies, so when I do I figure it must be pretty intense. Parts of this movie just ripped me up inside and I felt as if I might need to leave the theatre for a second to regain composure. Of course, I have a rule that I never abandon where I don't leave the movie before the credits roll.

I loved how everyone in the movie seemed to take their characters so seriously, except maybe for Jay Mohr, whom I think never really takes a role that seriously. Most of all, I'd have to say that the person that surprised me the most was Helen Hunt.

I never gave her a chance before, because she just all of a sudden started being in all of these movies one day, and I never watched her TV show, Mad About You, so I didn't know who she was exactly. I didn't know what to expect from her in this movie, but I can't ever turn down a Kevin Spacey movie, especially one as intriguing as this one. So I saw it, loved Kevin and Haley [as per usual] and went away thinking that Helen Hunt might not be so bad. I might even go see that Mel Gibson movie that she's going to be in later. Now I just completely suck.",10
18 October 2000,A cinematic marvel,"This film is truly amazing all around, and one of the most thought=provoking I've encountered in quite some time. The acting is fantastic, the story inspired, and the musical score very contemplative. It definitely leaves the viewer more than satisfied, and is to be highly recommended.

22 October 2000,A Sweet Flick,"I saw this movie, after having read many a lukewarm response from critics, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not one who usually goes for inspiration and sweetness, but with a cast like this, who wouldn't go? I thought it was an interesting, strong premise, and this was only enhanced by admirable performances by Haley Joel Osment and Kevin Spacey. I greatly endorse this movie, and I think that it's an enjoyable time.

18 October 2000,"Good, but predictable.","For the first twenty minutes, I truly enjoyed 'Pay it Forward'. I love Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt and am learning to like Haley Joel Osment. However, as creative as Kevin Spacey is, 'Pay it Forward' is a chick flick for women who don't like chick flicks. I cried, yes, but was mad at myself for doing it. As soon as the three major characters had been introduced I knew that Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey's characters would have to get together and it ruined the rest of the film for me. It's not *terribly* romanc-y, which saves it from the misfortune of being labelled a chick flick, but the only quality is in the characterization. 'Pay it Forward' gets some credit for continuing to focus on Trevor (Haley Joel Osment) even after it is obvious what is going to happen, and I liked the multiple plot lines. Kevin Spacey is lucky that he was a saving point instead of being dragged down in the plot; he gets lots of gold stars from me on his ability to a) act magnificently and b) portray an enormous variety of characters, including an excellent Mr Simonet; so I apologize to him in saying that the film was a flop.

I was not disappointed. This is one talented kid! The movie had depth, the characters were layered and the emotions were flowing! I highly recommend this movie. Two thumbs up!

3 February 2001,I think i just may...,"I went to see this movie for the sole reason that Haley Joel Osment is an inspiration to everyone, a brilliant actor not only gifted with acting talents far beyond his years but manners and humble appreciation for what he has achieved. I took along a friend who loves Kevin Spacey, but hates sappy movies, fearing the worst i said i would pay for the popcorn so she could bury her head in it when the 'sappy' bits came. My mother and sister had read the book and asked me to comment on it when I had come back. From the first moment to the last scene I was inspired, not only is the concept of 'pay it forward' brilliant but so is the message, that maybe some little things help in the larger scale of things. Thinking about all the little things i could do so that the world may function a little seem few but in retrospect if the pay it forward movement actually took place it could change lives. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt bonded on screen magically and the stories behind both of them were apparent in their characters. This film might not appear to a blockbuster victory but my friend never once dived into that popcorn for longer than a few seconds, sappy it isn't, splendid it is

21 October 2000,Incredible!!!,"FANTASTIC!EXRAORDINARY! It has been such a long time that I have seen a movie that made me FEEL something. I see alot and the last few have been major disappointments. This movie is no disappointment whatsoever. Osment is great, of course. Hunt was very believable(much like her character in AS Good as It Gets). But Spacey truly pays it forward by just doing what he does best. He accomplished what he was out to do. He made me FEEL something about his character. Watching his emotions on screen swept me away. I felt his sadness. I felt his anger. I felt his hurt when he looked at Hunt. This movie blew me away, and I am ready to go see it again and again. With the message in the movie, I feel that EVERYONE should see it.

You owe it to yourself. And you owe it to 3 more people to recommend this movie to them. Pay it forward!!

7 October 2000,I predict....,"I predict that there will be many who will just OOZE praise for this movie, and it's acting, plot, & thought-provoking elements. They will have basis for this praise, yet I am not sure it can be considered the BEST of the year, either.

That said, either I allowed myself to be caught up in the movie ""too much"", or it truly did have it's moments of surprise, time to time, with some, of course, more predictable elements. I went to see this based on my enjoyment of Haley Joel Osment in ""Sixth Sense"", and also a growing interest in Kevin Spacey. I even watched it paying full price, which I never do! :c)

I was not really disappointed by young Osment's acting, and at least once during the movie found myself hoping for many more movies from him, wondering where he may end up...

Anyway, I will go see it again, with a friend; I do not think your money will be wasted, unless you come & watch this movie without checking it out first (and it not being a movie you would like, anyway), or come expecting something it is not. I could not really tell the demographics of my fellow movie-watchers, but we all laughed several times, and I am sure there were many NOT-dry eyes as well!

Oh, by the way, I would not suggest you take your kids, with some sex, violence and alcohol scenes making the movie not-so-nice for them. But then, that is my opinion. :c)

Go, watch, & enjoy!",8
15 October 2000,Inspirational,"What if an idea from an 11-year old could change the world? This is the premise behind the new film 'Pay It Forward' starring Kevin Spacy, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment. It's the 1st day of school in Las Vegas and Trevor (Osment) has a new Social Studies teacher, Eugene Simonent (Spacy) who gives his students an extra-credit assignment at the start of each year; Do something to help change the world, not actually thinking that one of his students might actually accomplish something meaningful. Trevor comes up with 'Pay it Forward'. 3 big favors for 3 different people, something that they can't do on their own, and the only condition being that they pay it forward to 3 more strangers.

It's interesting to see that all three leads carry some kind of emotional baggage and a reluctance to share what they are feeling. Arlene (Hunt) hides with alcohol, Eugene hides behind his intelligence, and Trevor just refuses to talk to his mom (Arlene). Of course, we see this change during the course of the movie as Trevor implements 'Pay it Forward' by bringing a homeless man into the house, playing matchmaker for his mom and Eugene, and helping a friend fight off the school bully, the outcome of which is foreshadowed earlier in the film.

I liked this movie a lot. The performances were all universally good, even Hunt, whom i have never really enjoyed that much as an actress (she did not deserve her 1998 oscar win). Everyone makes their characters believable, and the way it plays out seems plausible, not contrived. My only issues with the film is that it is a little predictable and the ending seems far too contrived.

Other than that, if you are looking for a movie amidst this year that actually conveys hope in the human condition and wonders aloud why we can't just 'Pay it Forward', this is it. Heck, see it anyway for the acting. This is one of the best films i've seen this year and i'll be paying my recommendation forward.",9
18 July 2001,"Almost perfect, except for the ending","This was an excellent movie; truly a great cast, a unique premise with a hopeful and admirable idea: Do something nice for 3 strangers, and ask them to do the same, rather than pay you back. Pay it Forward. If you haven't seen this movie--see it.

Don't read past this point if you don't want to know details about the movie....

Now my big complaint: If you have seen it, then you know about the ending. As a writer myself, it never ceases to amaze me how the decision gets made to ruin a perfectly wonderful movie by killing off the main character. What a let down. They could have fooled the audience for just a few moments there at the end, and then brought him out, having survived the injury. Then they could have all stood outside and watched the vigil anyway. It could have been a vigil honoring his life and what he had done, and a massive thank you to him in person. It would have been just as poignant. What it turned out to be was a wake, and that spoiled the whole movie for me. Killing a character is the easy way to incite tears and emotion. The hard part is keeping everyone alive, and STILL engendering the same emotions. The unfortunate part about this movie, is that it had what it took to do just that, but someone copped out at the end. I guess i just prefer happy endings.",9

6 March 2001,A movie with great potential but ultimately disappointing.,"The three central actors were excellent (and I thought all were well cast). The basic premise was very interesting and initially well developed. However it seemed to lose its way in the middle. Subsequently it appeared to be coming together... then came the appalling ending making me wish I'd not gone to see the movie (and I haven't felt that way about a movie in a long time).

10/10 for the acting but overall only 5/10.

15 July 2001,A severely misunderstood film,"Pay it Forward isn't a great movie, certainly not a classic. But it is good -- the actors, setting, dialogue and, especially, the entire concept of paying big favors to three other people.

What is most annoying here on IMDB are all the reviews criticizing the ending which many claim ""doesn't fit"" because the audience didn't see it coming or that it negated the entire film -- sort of a ""path to hell is paved with good intentions"" sort of thing.

The idea of paying it forward, as expressed in the movie, is that it's not for yourself. In the process of paying it forward you, in fact, might lose -- get hurt, not be successful, whatever. The idea that paying it forward might be a ""safe"" act is never shown in the movie. In fact, it's almost always shown as an act of sucking it up, sacrificing, or taking a chance. Only in a perfect world does one always succeed when taking chances. That's why the ending isn't as ill fitting as critics might have us believe.

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The idea was to ""change the world."" Pay it Forward is a bit sappy, a little too sentimental perhaps, but still a great teaching tool to all of us. And as the ending shows, just because someone pays it forward doesn't mean they're ""entitled"" to something good. I wouldn't rank it a Citizen Kane, but I would say it's one of the most life affirming movies you'll see in a long long time.",9
11 November 2001,"Splendid, just splendid","I laughed and I cried. This was a really moving and inspiring movie. Hunt, Spacey and Osment were just perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. And I recommend you have a hanky near by.

30 June 2001,So much potential...,"and it went right out the window. Spacey, Hunt, and Osment are all excellent actors and their performances were first-rate in this film. Unfortunately though the message was meant to be a positive, the generally somber tone of the movie obscured any good meant to come from it.

And the ending...gracious! It served absolutely NO purpose except perhaps to fit some generally ""accepted"" model (and, as several others have commented, to emotionally manipulate the audience). I think ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies in this case. The story woven in about the reporter was also a bit distracting. Yes, it did tie in with the overall plot, but also tended to disrupt it throughout the movie.

'A' for effort...but in the end the writers went more for high ratings on the kleenex-o-meter than for a truly positive message and a good, solid plot.

The idea behind this movie is excellent and Mimi Leder does an exquisite job of portraying it to the audience. The idea of how helping another individual, no matter what it may be, can change and have an impact on the world. I give this film a 9 out of 10 and would recommend it highly to anyone.

7 January 2007,Hope and Love,"Eleven Years old Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) is entering the seventh grade. His social studies teacher, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), introduce the course with the same speech as every year ... and as every year, he gives his students an assignment ... ""Find a way to change the world and put it into action"". Of course, Eugene Simonet hopes rather than believes, that at least one student would stand up and go for it. Indeed his hopes are not in vain as Trevor McKinney takes this assignment at heart. He thinks that if he could help three persons to ""fix"" their lives, they would, each of them, pay it forward by helping three persons each ... three helped ... nine ... twenty-seven ... and so on. No need to tell you that this assignment will change Trevor's life, his mother's, Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt), Eugene Simonet and many more ...

Inspired by the novel called by the same title from Catherine Ryan Hyde, Pay It Forward is the most genuine idea I saw about ""how to make this world a better place"". I do believe that most of you already had this kind of thought ... the same way I did ... why people are like this ... why do they behave so bad toward each other ... why life has to be that difficult all the time for most of us ... I could ask as many questions as I like, the only answer would be ""it is the way it always has been. It's the human nature."" and all this kind of crap. On the other hand, humanity has got a lot of goodness ... and this movie shows that. No matter the troubles you are in, as long as you do not give up you can make a difference to make life a little bit better, no matter the level you are acting. Goodness is reachable for each of us. I call that HOPE and LOVE. Trevor says in the movie something like ""Bad people have given up for the loss of those who haven't"". It is so true... Pay it Forward is a movie about the true love of life. Do not miss it !",9
2 April 2002,Big Frown,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

23 June 2002,This movie is great!,"This movie is really, really great. One of the strongest drama-movie I've ever seen. Everytime I see Haley Joel Osment in a movie I get amazed over how well he's acting. He deserves an Academy Award soon. Kevin spacey and Helen Hunt are also great in this movie! It's a great script and the movie has a message. Eveyone who hasn't seen this movie, definetly should!

24 January 2002,Give Me My Money Back,"I found this movie to be utter nonsense. The premise, though intriguing, lacks believability. I must admit, I didn't get what the title meant until midway through the movie, but beside a clever title and ""A"" list stars, the movie lacks substance.

I can't blame the actors, they all do what they can, except Helen Hunt is reprising her role as a concerned mommy/in her suitor's face, Erin Brockovich type with a bleached perm and tight jeans.

Kevin Spacey, always surprises me. He seems so geeky, but I get lost in his character's wit and facial expressions.

Haley Joel Osment does a fine job, though his character pushes the limit of what an eleven year old would say, but that's the scripts fault. He is good at crying, did he cry in Artificial Intelligence too?

I guess the blame must be equally put on Leslie Dixon, who adapted the book and to Mimi Leder, who should stick to television in my opinion.

There are some highlights, such as Angie Dickinson, or was that Martha Stewart? Jon Bon Jovi is merely eye candy. He did a better job on McBeal.

Trust me, I like sappy, but good films. This is sappy and bad. I could see it being a good play perhaps, but it doesn't hold up as touching movie and the ending is less believable than the concept of people selflessly helping others. We are in the ""What me worry?"" generation.",
23 January 2002,"Once again, a movie fails utterly to live up to the book","Maybe I should be used to it by now, but 'Pay It Forward' (book) was so simple and elegant that I expected a more faithful translation. I will admit that the spirit of the book held up in the movie, although it was somewhat diminished in scope. However, my greatest disappointments lie in the casting. Helen Hunt was unbecoming (watch her mouth) and unbelievable as the mother of Trevor. Kevin Spacey's character was turned from a mutilated African-American vietnam vet to a white burn victim of his father's abuse. Most disappointing was Haley Joel Osment, whom I have admired much in other features. He came across as surly and resentful, and although this may be characteristic of pre-adolescence, it was not faithful to the book's character of Trevor, who I'm sure had his moments, but was drawn in the book with a much finer hand. Introspective and sensitive, he was a much more interesting character than the film portrayed. I admire all of these actors and feel the movie was miscast, and the screenplay was ill done. Read the book! It's a better fairy tale that one could wish for.

21 October 2000,An absolutely incredible film,"I sat through this movie not knowing what to expect. I came in part to see Haley Joel Osment, who I absolutely loved in The Sixth Sense. He is an incredible actor and in this movie he didn't disappoint. I was totally touched and inspired by this film. I was only halfway through the movie and I already wanted to see it again. No other movie has had this kind of impact on me, that I would want to see it again before seeing it the whole way through the first time. It's an incredible acting job by the three main stars, with a great love story, all intertwined by this wonderfully written film that will keep you captivated all the way to the stunning climax. This is a 4 star and a 2 kleenex box movie - see it and be touched.

18 October 2000,Spacey is decent--too bad about the script,"I wouldn't have missed this new Kevin Spacey film, and he was fine in it. Too bad that the rest of the movie isn't fine. The script is unbelievable and it plays like a Disney movie. However, I think America will generally like this film since it pushes all the right buttons.

That score--I've heard it before (I LOVED it in AMERICAN BEAUTY, but folks, this movie is NOT AMERICAN BEAUTY). That kid--I've seen him before (how many more times do we have to see him play ""sensitive undersized boy with quivering lip"" before the kid grows up?)That mom--I've seen her before in everything Helen Hunt plays, just ratched up a notch.

Helen Hunt is one of those actresses I would like to like, but I don't.

Kevin Spacey is good, as always. He usually doesn't miss when picking a script, wonder why he missed on this one. Oh well, there will be other fine movies from him. This one is a big yawn.

A powerful and very moving story, that makes everyone want to ""pay it forward"". The cast was excellent. Such a touchy and memorable story. I recommend it to everyone just dont forget you tissues.

8 October 2000,Have you Heard?,"Wow. I don't think I need to say any more. Because there really isn't anything I can say about this film to articulate what it means. I can try (and I will), but you simply have to see it for yourself. I mean that. I went to see this movie because I'm a sucker for Oscar buzz. And this movie has it. But forget all that. If you can't now, you will... I did. First of all, this movie had quite an effect on me. I would say the movie makes you want to go out and change the world, but I hope it doesn't... it should make you go out and actually change the world. Make some kind of a difference. Because that's what the young boy in the film did. And the world was better for it. On one level, the film is about three people... an altruistic 11-year-old kid, his alcoholic mother, and his physically scarred elementary school teacher. The teacher gives an assignment: ""Think of an idea to change the world, and put it into ACTION."" The kid comes up with ""Pay it Forward"" Do a big favor for someone else ... something they cant do for themselves, and instead of having them do something in return for you, they pay it forward... three big favors, for three other people. And that's just the setup... this film was incredible! Fantastic acting, an inspiring story, emotional, tragic, a total powerhouse movie. So I've told you... but what does it really mean... well you won't know until you see it. This movie pulls at you. You go through the same frustration as the boy when he wonders if the world can be changed. Or if it will just remain ""s**t"" and it would be hopeless for any of us, in all our vanity to attempt such a feat. Maybe it can't be done alone. Maybe it can start out small, and grow. Maybe this movie (as lame as this sounds) can be the beginning.",10
30 October 2000,Disappointing,"Highly talented cast, Catchy tagline, Positive reviews from the forum; obviously I had high expectations. And I was let down. It is rather a romance centered ""chick-flick"" than what it says it is. Good performances by the actors, but wasted in a terrible film. 2/10.

5 June 2001,give it a try,"I have to admit I am a bit surprised. I did not think I would like this movie at all. The film did not have an earth shattering effect on my life, but wow, these are some great performances. The acting might have been a bit better than the actual film, but nevertheless, I found the movie to be quite good, even moving. I thought it avoided being truly sappy and in the end the film as a whole compensates for any overly cheesy moments early on. There are a lot of little moments within this film that carry so much more weight than the bigger, more ""Hollywood"" moments. Without being pretentious, all the supporting characters in the film speak great truths (directly and indirectly) about life and I get the feeling that this movie needs to be watched closely in order for the best parts to be absorbed. One more thing, Angie Dickinson is the best.

30 October 2000,Blah.,"Haven't any of you read the frigging book? Only one of you it seems. :P Anyway, I thought that this movie was very poor in comparison to the book. The ending is ALMOST like the book's ending... almost. For some reason, it just seems better in the book. No wait, the book was definitely much better. They ripped up a beautiful story, and turned it into THIS. Here's an example of the changes. (S P O I L E R S) Reuben St. Clair is Trevor's teacher in Atascadero, California in the book, a black man, missing just about half of his face due to something that happened in the Vietnam War. In this movie, he is a white man named Eugene Simonet with bearly visible burns(until you see his chest) that was burnt by his psychotic drunk of a papa. Trevor McKinney helped out Jerry, Mrs. Greenberg, and Mr. St. Clair in the book. Not so in the movie. He tries to help Jerry, Mr. Simonet, and Adam, a boy that is always beaten up by the bullies at school. In this movie, the characters related to Mrs. Greenberg, with the exception of Sydney G., have all been replaced with Arlene's mother, who was already in the book(in a smaller role) anyway. This is four characters related to her and her herself. Plus, Trevor doesn't get to meet Bill Clinton in the movie. Poor Trevor. The movie industry has changed him into a foul-mouthed young boy who not only doesn't get to meet the president now and then die in Washington, trying to fulfill his third bit of ""Paying it Forward""(long story; READ THE BOOK). No, no, he dies trying to help his friend at school from being beaten up after getting on tv. So, all in all... Book Movie Book: 9 out of 10 Movie: 3 out of 10",

10 December 2000,Great acting in moving film.,"Great acting by the three principals. However, how much you like the film will depend on how you are affected by the ending. Either you will recognize that as the point to which the film has logically been heading or it will strike you as shamelessly manipulative. It appears Haley Joel Osment can do no wrong. He should have a great career in film. Helen Hunt gives an emotionally honest performance as his mother. Kevin Spacey follows up his triumph in ""American Beauty"" with another moving portrayal. Thank goodness Robin Williams wasn't given the part!

22 August 2001,"A movie about the goodness of men, ending with the most black page of mankind. A must see.","This movie really shows a great plan of a small kid (Haley Joel Osment as Trevor) to make the world a better place, on small scale that is. It's a typical view of a 11-year old kid to see only goodness in men, on which his idea was based. Though he thinks his plan failed, it has grown bigger than he ever expected. Just when you think everything gets an happy ending, the other side of mankind shows and clearly demonstrates that something like a perfect world will always be an utopia. Though some reviewers see this part as a movie killer, it think it best reflects reality. And surely, that emotional ending will make you remember this movie for quite some time...

21 October 2000,Great cast + Great story = Outstanding film!,"I saw 'Pay it Forward' this weekend and was mesmerized. As a fan of sentimental, lessons of life movies like 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', I count this among my favorites. Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment are all outstanding actors. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, for once, a dream team of actors out to make a great picture. Most movies today are filled with a dream team of POPULAR actors out to make a lot of MONEY. Not that this will not make money. It will. But nobody is going to remember how much money it made ten years down the line. All that people will remember is how it affected them and what they learned from it. A remarkable film! 10/10.

8 October 2000,Bring the Kleenex,"This one just knocked ""Almost Famous"" down to #2 for 2000. Great acting is an understatement, the three leads are superb! Original script and fantastic soundtrack(think American Beauty) to boot. Haley Joel Osment deserves the Oscar. This kid is not a fluke - his facial expressions convey the equivalent of 10 pages of dialogue. I've always liked Helen Hunt, but now I'm in love. There is not one false note in her portrayal of an alcoholic mother trying to do the right thing for her son and herself. Kevin Spacey makes another excellent career choice - this guy can pick winners. Ending might disappoint some, but real life doesn't always have happy endings. And who would have ever thought we'd get to see Angie Dickinson as an old bag lady!!!!9++

15 October 2000,One good turn deserves three more,"Hopefully, we have all been blessed with at least one teacher who inspires thought after the bell rings. In ""Pay It Forward"", Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) is such a teacher, challenging his Las Vegas social studies youngsters to a year-long project of making a difference in the world. Student Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment)ambitiously sets out to improve the lives of three people who are instructed to help three others who help three more, thereby ""paying it forward"" instead of paying it back.

But young Trevor quickly discovers potholes on the road to good intentions, problems like an alcohol-abusive mother (Helen Hunt), a scarred teacher unwilling to talk about his past and a homeless man unable to kick his drug habit. Just as reality slaps Trevor in the face, it cuts him some slack too. The ""pay it forward"" movement starts spreading while Mom and Mr. Simonet try to get to know each other a bit better. All this, woven through the fabric of a reporter (Jay Mohr) trying to track down the spark for ""pay it forward"".

Spacey, Hunt and Osment all turn in Oscar-worthy performances for ""Deep Impact"" director Mimi Leder, who once again saves much of the world while letting a small part of it die. Indeed, people will be talking about the ""Pay It Forward"" ending just as they did with ""The Sixth Sense"". Keep it to yourself.",10
2 September 2006,Show it to your 14 year olds.,"As a mother of 2 teenagers, I highly value this film. A pre-pubescent boy,in particular, with limited guidance in his life, is fortunate to land in class for the new year with a teacher who evokes a thought process within his trusting soul. It is an engaging film which encourages the viewer to look inside oneself as the child has, only to see his own efforts mostly fail, but the domino effect of his naive concept has more far reaching consequences than anyone could anticipate. It is touching, thought provoking, and well acted. Thankfully not too much time was wasted on what might have seemed to be other significant characters, but there is a lot to digest if you are eager to receive the message which is loud and clear well before the poignant conclusion.

However, this is what makes the movie great. I have not been touched by a movie to such a great extent, since American Beauty. All three title stars give oscar caliber performances. A definite must see.

11 July 2001,"Cheesy, yes. Affective, certainly.","Okay so the movie is what it is. It's Hollywood feeling self-important. But jeez, let's get real, it does it so well. The other user comments seem right on course, the only thing I don't understand is why everybody seems to have a problem with the ending. You have to ask yourself, what's the alternative? It's way too feel good if the film doesn't end the way it does. It has to acknowledge that change is difficult. I don't think there's any other way for the film to end. The filmmakers (now I'm not saying that Mimi Leder is the filmmaking Godsend, in fact, quite the opposite) were very successful in tempering the inherent feel

goodness with a certain manipulation in order to try and inspire. How successful is the inspiration? Not very. But of course your reading the words of a world weary cynic; of course, a cynic who actually liked the movie.

Terrific theme that we can all apply to our lives. Good development of virtually every character. Tragic end, though.

I left this movie fulfilled with the story, feeling inadequate with what I have done with my life, entranced by the actors...truly deserves a rating of 10!

6 October 2001,Heart Tugger with believable characters,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Excellent performances from all the leads. Kevin Spacey was typically brilliant. Helen Hunt played a great role and Haley Joel Osmond was entirely engaging as the lead role.

There was some beautifully framed shots in the film, and it didn't get overly mushy. The ending (in the house and outside) was a little over the top, and could have been better served with a more subtle offering.

Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable film that managed to touch on the meaning of hope and the value of perseverance.

3 November 2022,A film work that is important to see and then act on.,"The story of the film itself is good, but the most wonderful thing about this film is that it teaches us how to think, how to think, and how the world can be changed by doing so, in an easy-to-understand way. I am sure you will enjoy this film.

Is the film itself interesting? This is also an important factor. But more than that, this film is about what people around the world should do now. This film made me think about that.

Whether or not all of these ideas are correct at times may change depending on when you view this work.

However, I believe that watching this work now will inspire me in many ways to move in the right direction in my own life.

It is a very beautiful work.

It makes me think about what I should do now.",10

I love all the actors in it and so was very excited to go but I have never felt like a movie tried to manipulate my emotions more.

Save yourself the time and I won't spoil anything about the ending so I'll just say three words...Field of Dreams. You want a good movie go rent Memento then go see The Man Who Wasn't There. Trust me.

23 February 2002,I paid it forward...,"I recently rented this movie and didn't expect much of it, I said to myself: ""What's the worst that could happen? Hylie Joel Osment plays here!' ever since Forrest Gump I'm a huge fan of the little fellow, It's just a matter of time until he'll stand in front of thousands of people and say: `I would like to thank my mommy and daddy' you know the usual stuff. Anyway to my surprise I found a terrific movie brilliantly written and directed, I must bow down and hail the caster, I just love Kevin Spacey I think he's a terrific actor and more important a good human being! Helen Hunt, is also a great actresses and of course Jay Mohr the best underrated actor in Hollywood in my opinion his place is with the best.

`Pay it forward' is a wonderful movie I totally attached to it and felt like I want to be a part of Osment's project, I must congratulate Catherine Ryan Hyde (who wrote the book) on a job well done writing such a realistic and un-American book (I can't explain what I mean here because if I will it might damage the movie for you).

All in all one of the best movies that came out of Hollywood well played and well written 2 thumbs! I give it 3 out of 3 in TRON's scale.",10
28 July 2001,"o.k. acting, horrible, cynical story","Every character was engulfed in some personal tragedy and was merely holding on for survival. For no reason at all, one of the protagonists is killed. One of the pay-it-forward gestures included aiding a criminal in flight. What? Not a single redeeming characteristic - no hopefulness, no redemption of any of the characters, not even any scenery. Steve Martin's Grand Canyon ran us through some of this much more successfully a few years ago. The big mystery is, how did such a mess of a story attract 3 of the hottest actors around?

22 December 2004,One of the saddest ending movies I have ever seen,"I thought it was pretty good. I thought that Helen Hunt wasn't the best person to play an allelic mother, but Haley JOel fit the part as Trevor perfectly. I can't believe how it ended though. I wasn't expecting it at all. Is that a trend with Haley Joel Osment. Does he ALWAYS play in movies with a giant twist for an end. This is only the second movie I saw of his, (the first one was 'The Sixth Sense') and they both ended in a way that you just plain 'never-saw-it-coming'. And what was with the scene that Helen Hunt and the teacher 'spent the night' together. That was enough to make me HURL. Overall, it wasn't that bad of a movie, but it definitely needs a new ending.

23 June 2006,"A remarkable seventh grade boy creates an idea called ""pay it forward""","Pay It Forward is an absolutely brilliant, inspiring movie about an eleven-year-old named Trevor McKinney (Hayley Joel Osment) whose assignment is to make up an idea of, indeed, how to make the world a better place. He starts out by trying to fix a few wrongs he felt took place in his own life, such as struggling to forgive his alcoholic mother, Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt) a woman who struggles with needing to be there for Trevor, and making the decision of whether he truly hates his also alcoholic father, who was never there to be one. He seems to feel too helpless to fix his life. Now, before you roll your eyes and say, ""It is impossible to make the world a better place, there is no way an eleven-year-old could do it,"" let me introduce you to this movie, and Trevor. He has this idea of, in fact, paying it forward. If you do something big, something extraordinarily generous for another person (most preferably an enemy) and if they say, ""How can I repay you?"" you tell them, ""pay it forward."" Do something nice for three other people. It was a movie worth laughing, crying, and allowing chills to cover every inch of you, because that's exactly what it did for me. Although the end of the movie was just devastating, it does leave you thinking about how this idea of pay it forward could really work. It is something we all have the power to do, we just choose not to do it because our fears blind us. Believe it or not, movies do teach us about life, but this one was the most intriguing. It leaves you thinking about the message of this movie, which is about forgiveness, loving your enemies, and, although life is hard, you get through it by trying your best to live it.",10
1 October 2006,Surprisingly good,"There are 3 stars in the movie. I guess the kid is the real star and he's great plus Kevin Spacy is excellent. But Helen Hunt - I like her and I've seen a lot of stuff with her. She always looks good because she's a natural beauty like men dream about, but this is the first time I've seen her in a role that was really sexy. It took me a minute to recognize her because she looks like an ordinary person in the movie, dressed like trailer trash, complete with personal problems like a real single mother. Kevin Spacy plays a middle school teacher. He's got physical and emotional scars and while he seems to be a good teacher and inspires the kids he's portrayed as leading a solitary, lonely life. Thruout the movie we see characters act bravely, performing extraordinary favors for strangers, which a reporter traces back to the kids social studies project.

14 October 2000,"Fantastic, Wonderful, !- Great acting, great plot, fulfilling...","I never cry at movies. I am just not that kind of person- Titanic made me laugh at the end, unlike the people emptying their tear ducts next to me. However, this wonderful film left me euphoric (now everyone pull out their dictionaries...). I saw it at a sneak preview tonight, and I am still on a high. I cannot wait to see it again. If you feel disillusioned or happy, either way you will love this movie. The acting is fantastic- what would you expect with Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment (my personal favorite) and Kevin Spacey? I can't think of enough synonyms for the feeling that this film is as close to perfect as we can get this year. Just give the kid his Oscar already and give the rest of the cast their second or so.

28 May 2002,I found it oddly unmoving despite great acting.,"I really wanted to like ""Pay it Forward"" a lot. I love the kid and Keven Spacey is always worth the price of admission - even if you actually GO to the movie. But oddly enough, I found it very unmoving. It did not grab me emotionally. It felt somehow contrived and the time-line was very confusing. The ending was really disappointing, although I guess the director did not know where to go with it. It's too bad, because I think it could have been a lot better if it he hadn't tried so hard to infuse it with great significance, and just let the story play out. Oh well, now I'll go watch ""Artificial Intelligence"" - I really DO love the kid!

2 November 2000,I guess I'll never be a critic!,"I saw this movie for the second time yesterday and enjoyed it as much, if not more the first time. Although my least favorite character was Helen Hunt's I still feel that she portrayed the part of the single mother coping with her problems and raising a young boy very well. Additionally James Caviezel's portral of Jerry was extremely well acted. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey as Eugene Simonet and especially liked Haley Joel Osmet as Trevor. I've seen Haley in three movies Forrest Gump, Sixth Sense and Pay it forward and have loved him in each. There is something so endearing about that little guy that it's hard to describe. I cared about what happened to all of the characters and have always said that if a movie can make me laugh, cry, scared and or care for it's characters it has done it's job. It give Pay It Forward a 10 out of 10!

27 October 2000,"Not flawless, but moving and impressive","Pay It Forward has elicited two key complaints: some argue that it is optimistic to a fault while others contend that its dark complexity verges on gratuitous. There are, of course, many other minor complaints from those who struggled with the timeline and those who just like to complain. It seems that Pay It Forward suffers not from lack of quality but from an audience that is at once too cynical and too deluded.

The plot of the film focuses on the troubled life of Trevor McKinney, played by notoriously gifted child-star Haley Joel Osment. The eleven year-old son of alcoholic Arlene (Helen Hunt) and an AWOL father, Trevor is inspired by his distant, intellectual teacher, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey). Simonet poses a challenge to his students: find a plan to change the world and put it into action. Trevor, ambitious and optimistic, creates `pay it forward.' He will help three people in ways that they could not have helped themselves. Instead of paying back the favor, the beneficiaries must pay it forward, doing a major favor for three others.

The film doesn't try to pass as pure realism. In fact, it pokes fun at its own Utopian suggestions, with a class full of eleven year-olds critiquing its dependence on the `honor system' Additionally, while Trevor's pyramid scheme does work, Pay It Forward doesn't glorify man's inner goodness. Despite their golden intentions, many characters only `pay it forward' reluctantly, when an opportunity unavoidably drops before them. And the favors done for these people don't miraculously reshape lives. The character's move on, improved but still fallible.

Nor does the movie ride on pure optimism. It is dark and complex. Trevor holds that pay it forward only works if the favors are big...actions that are difficult for the person paying it forward. The scheme doesn't try to transform people; it only hopes to improve them. Each character still stumbles, despite the good deeds done unto them. The audience is pulled into the maze of ugly pasts that make these favors so difficult. Admittedly, the story does teeter dangerously close to cliched issues, such as child abuse and drug habits. Some of this must be seen as symbolic, used to illustrate that the world can be an ugly place.

Still, where the story stumbles, the actors carry it through. Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment revive last year's overwhelming talent shows in two award worthy portrayals. Spacey is convincing as an ideal teacher with a troubled past. He moves the audience without falling into the potentially melodramatic backdrop of the film. Osment stabilizes his place as the most talented child actor available as a child torn between his learned cynicism and his innate optimism. Helen Hunt resurfaces with a performance rivaling her costars.

Overall, this film overcomes its inherent, structural difficulties. The script usually manages to avoid waxing overly cynical or excessively hopeful. Where the writing falters, the cast keeps the film on track. Pay It Forward offers a rewarding, moving experience to anyone willing to surrender a little bit of realism for everything the movie has to offer.",
4 March 2001,"Shallow, predictable","Although this movie strives to look like ""American Beauty 2"" (similar soundtrack, air photo of the private neighborhood), it is shallow and predictable. You can see why each part got itself into the script, like seeing the backside of making the movie while watching it. There are more creative ways to teach people good ideas, let's hope they'll be chosen next time.

13 November 2000,"Pay it Forward is a great great movie, very symbolic","Symbolism in this movie was terrific. The part where Spacey and Osment are in the classroom alone, where Spacey says something along the lines of ""You are doing a great job"" and then some. But when Osment walks away, out of the classroom, he says, ""You always say that, you are the teacher."" The great thing about this scene is that the teacher was sitting in the classroom in a student's chair while a student is leaving the room. Do you get it? Beautiful movie. Especially the ending when the ""Field of Dreams"" caravan to Trevor's house comes to leave well-wishes and flowers. I hope that this film receives more Oscars than one.

3 February 2001,"sad, but fulfilling","Despite the emotional emptiness that the movie might leave you with, a great part of it is devotion to ambition, and I add it to my short list of inspiring films (Gattacca, The Shawshank Redemption, Bringing out the Dead).

The plot itself is funny and entertaining in many parts, mixed with heart wrenching scenes between Trevor, Arlene and Eugene. The acting is top notch (without a doubt in my mind) from all the actors, the casting is near-perfect. Even Jon Bon Jovi plays a pretty good street-person.

I recommend this movie to those who want something more than just a Hollywoodesque ending. The script is fairly polished, although there are some seemingly overdone dialogues which make Trevor unbelievable as a child at times. However, despite these minor flaws, the film proves itself to be extremely entertaining while carrying important messages.

As a film, its not the best I have seen, but it certainly is one that I came away with a lot more than I expected to.",8
18 October 2000,Could've been great,"This movie could have been so much more than it actually is. The concept is great;helping other people, and expecting nothing in return, only that they ""pay it forward"". It has an idealism that is rare in today's movies. The acting is also wonderful all around. But ultimately, the film is defeated by its cliches. There's the alcoholic mother who has to be saved. The disfigured teacher with secrets to hide. The drunken father who comes home only to yell at his wife and beat her up. The cliches prevent you from losing yourself in the movie, because you're continually thinking, ""Well, that was convenient."" The cliches in the movie defeat itself, which is a shame. This could have been a great movie.

21 October 2000,Early Choice for an Oscar Sweep,"Let's come out and say it. Kevin Spacey was brilliant in this film. However, while he deserves an Oscar for his work in it, it should probably be a win as Supporting Actor, as my vote goes to Haley Joel Osment for Best Actor. Osment was an acting revelation in this film, surpassing his work in The Sixth Sense by miles. Yet another ""however"" though is Helen Hunt's performance as Osment's alcoholic mother. Hunt's characterization of a mother in recovery is amazing. The performances of these three amazingly talented people is what drives this film. I would recommend it to anyone.

10 October 2000,best pic nominee? yes! winner? no!,"HANDS DOWN GREAT MOVIE! 10 outta 10

You see the names Spacey, Hunt and Osment and oscar potential already pops in your head, the fact is it remains when you walk out. To tell you anymore than the trailer gives you would only lesson your experience of seeing this movie. Unfortunately i'm bias for i am a huge kevin spacey fan. I thought he delivered yet another oscar worthy performance, as did Helen Hunt. As for Haley Joel Osment, surprisingly He was the one who stole the show(and this is hard for me to say b/c i'm usually in awe of KS's acting the whole movie). It's like he took his loss for best supporting actor and said TAKE THAT! to the committee (by the way i do believe he should've won over michael caine, i don't care how old he is, this kid is for real!). I see nominations for this movie all around but in honesty I think if any nomination turns into an oscar it belongs to Haley. Spacey and Hunt are at their finest equivalent their winning roles but I believe Haley steps it up even more from sixth sense so in turn he should win this year hands down!

As for best pic, i don't think it will win for the simple reason of it's parallels to American Beauty. The committee likes to be original every year w/ their best picture choice and the music holds a similarity, kevin spacey's excellence is evident in both, and the world is a betta place than it seems theme exists w/ both movies. Too many voters may see this as a nicer, viewer friendly american beauty w/ the leads shining again, which is why it probably won't win. Bottom line GO SEE THIS MOVIE, if you love comedy, drama, inspiration, or just great acting this one is for you which pretty much makes it for everyone.",10
7 December 2002,"forced and unrealistic, but it's okay","'pay it forward' is not a great film, but it's not bad. i like the simple concept of 'pay it forward', and i wouldn't be surprised if something like that really happened in real life. the acting was average by the actors...kevin spacey could have delivered his lines a bit more convincingly. my main problem with this film is that it's very unrealistic...this is mainly due to the fact that so much info is cramped into everything. for example, the teacher happens to have an abusive childhood as well. the grandma's homeless, etc etc etc. it's not over-acting, just over-plotting. the ending was controversial, but i think they made the right choice of ending. take away the over-blown slow motion and it would have been okay for me. i would have had a good cry at the end of this movie, but something about the whole movie just irritated me. i can't quite put my finger on it, but i just couldn't bring myself to feel emotional about something that was so unrealistic.

5 October 2000,"Movie plot and script prove worthy of such talented thespians ss Osment, Hunt, and Spacey","This sweet, simple, yet ingenious script, tells a story equal to the incredible talent in front of the camera. Most noticeably, film proves that young Mr. Haley Joel Osment's special performance in Sixth Sense was no fluke - for this child has the chops. Only small complaint is not that the script lacks originality nor heart, only that the plot - while unique and certainly not without twists - becomes relatively predictable and staid in respect to the love story subplot between reluctant and flawed hero Spacey and the talented Hunt, who basically reprises her role from ""As Good As It Gets"". Despite that caveat, the novelty of the brilliant in theory, although obviously impossible to implement, idea brought forward by Kevin Spacey's character comes shining through as he is perfectly cast against type as a somewhat squirmish teacher who instructs his class that they must perform three selfless acts and convince the three people for whom they perform these acts to do the same in perpetuity in order for the students to pass. The idea, in short, is 1 becomes 3 becomes 9 becomes 27, followed by 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, etc., so that in less than several weeks Spacey's character has the lofty goal of having over 2,000,000 participants in his goodwill revolution.

Included as a student in the class is the wonderful Osment, whose relationship with Spacey allows his radiant acting to transcend being labelled as a great child thespian and rather proves that he is more than ready for the task to being called simply a great actor equal to Spacey and Hunt. Hunt and Spacey have each brought home their hardware from the Oscars, and I suspect that this year Osment will rightfully join them (unless Will Smith sneaks in with his spin in Redford's ""Bagger Vance""). In short, ""Pay It Forward"" is a special movie with a heart as big as teacher played by Spacey's noble -- albeit naive -- attempt at social reconstructionism.",10
21 December 2000,Go and try to help someone!,"I just love the story and feel so close to my heart. When I was very young, I started to realized that there are many people who were so loving and caring for me. However, many of them I had never had a chance to repay them, because either they were dead or they are too far to reach, some even strangers that I never knew who they were. I had thought of how to repay them, so one day I suddenly told myself that those who helped me had never asked me to repay them; the best way is to help or love or care someone without asking them to pay back, and hope that they were refer this kind of special touch to others. I don't know how much I had done, but I became a custom to it. I just like to do something for someone, and I never expect anything from them, only wishing they would help or care or love others the way I did. That is why I really like this movie, it touches my heart. Don't you all watch it and feel that we could do something to change not only three persons but as many as we could. If you don't like this movie, hope you still find when you try something like the boy had done, you might help yourself too. Yet I would encourage you to watch with some thoughts, and find the message it try to send through.

The ending was sad that was the set back of this movie, yet it was emotional for me to cry and I do know the violence occurred in many American schools, and glad that in Malaysia, our children are safer than that.",10
26 October 2000,The Kind of Movie Some People Can't Believe In....,"The cast of Pay It Forward sent me into the theater with very high expectations, and none of them let me down in the least. Kevin Spacey (gasp and swoon) was fantastic as usual. He gets better and better with every single movie he makes. I found myself hurting and loving with him throughout the movie. He can reach out and force you to feel things. Amazing. Helen Hunt, usually a very beautiful woman, managed to look totally used up in the beginning of the film, but she remained a vibrant character nevertheless. Little Haley Joel was marvelous and very realistic and the scenes between his character and Spacey's character are simply breathtaking. A testament to both their wonderful talents. Helen Hunt and Osment also worked well as a pair, and Hunt and Spacey were convincing together. I got the sense they were still awkward with one another---just as people in their situation might be. Critics have split decisions about this film because of its ""syrupy content"" but I think some people simply have lost the ability to believe in the basic goodness of people. This film appealed to that. I am a pretty tough gal, but I came out of the theater wiping my eyes right along with everyone else. (Old men and young men included.) This film gets under your skin and makes you wish for better days when people still treated one another with some decency. I think we all need that. This movie is good enough to see twice. See it with someone you love.",10
10 October 2000,I cannot say enough of how wonderful this one is...,"I completely agree with what the other reviewers here said - this is truly the most amazing I have seen in a long time, if not ever. I chronically despise 'blockbusters', hype, and the words ""must see"", but for the first time in my life I can recommend this to everyone. I do not even like to go to the cinema because of the current outrageous prices, but I will pay to see this again when it comes out. Not to mention again on video, and again on cable, and again, etc.

To quote a colleague that was also at the screening, ""Every person in the world should be required by law to see this every 3 months.' Anyone with a heart will re-evaluate what is really important in their lives after viewing.

And two words - take tissue (despite the way the trailer makes it look!)

6 October 2000,Definite Oscar Contender,"Pay it Forward is perhaps the most poignant movie I have seen this year. Haley Joel Osment delivers a strikingly real portrayal of a young man that is light years ahead in thinking to his contemporaries. The movie speaks to the soul and brings hope to a life that is ""s**t"". It is definitely the feel good movie of the year, delivering Oscar worthy performances by all 3 of the main cast members. Kevin Spacey plays the teacher that everyone wishes they had or the teacher that everyone once had and have never forgotten. Helen Hunt gives a performance that reminds us of the one given in ""As Good As It Gets"". This movie is done in a way that reminds us of ""American Beauty"" and all its glory. Mark my words. This movie WILL win an Oscar.

23 October 2000,Tremendous Acting Compensates for a Slightly Flawed Script,"All in all a solid, emotional blockbuster for 3 huge actors, and certainly worth seeing. While its biggest flaws are a few predictable, trite plot elements and lines pandering to what will be a massive worldwide audience by year's end, the acting is commendable. Spacey, Hunt, and Osment employ their incredible talent in increasingly moving scenes to deliver a fairly simple, straightforward ""feel-good"" concept requiring a child-like abandonment of cynicism for its success.

This film mixes the predictable, touching substance of ""Forrest Gump"" with the harshness of ""Leaving Las Vegas"", and certainly sort of secures Osment's position as the most talented child actor of our time. We should expect he'll receive another Oscar nomination with a probable win after another very mature performance. Spacey and Hunt may also be nominated, but it would be surprising to see them win again for such generally predictable roles.

21 October 2000,A possibility missed!,"I read the book. I got the point there. What a message! The threads were woven in a way that made sense and followed. I thought the book and movie were both predictable, but I cried anyhow because it touched me, as it did most of the audience in the theater. But I believe the scriptwriter actually thought they got the point and yet missed it. They told the story of the people. It's actually the story of the possibilities, the hope. Oh, some people will 'get' it. And it is a wonderful message. But there are threads that come from nowhere, that weren't in the book and I felt cut short on the lesson -- that it is supposed to be an 'unconscionable' act of good. Helen Hunt (in an absolutely wonderful performance) -- her character is not one of those her son actually chooses. Yet the thread is there in the movie. I didn't like it as well. The thread in the book made more sense, included more emotional strings, showed more of 'normal' patterning in passing it along. I went in thinking that if the director and screenwriter did their jobs correctly, this movie could absolutely change the world because it would gift those who saw it -- and chose to understand and let it affect their lives -- with the desire to 'pay it forward.' Instead, I think it's just slow and sad in that respect. There are a few wonderful lines and moments from the book that I think could have translated the message with only minor additions to the script. But, alas, it looks like the director had a different message in mind. The time jumps were confusing. The emotions were missing. There were character arcs that were incomplete. It's still a good movie, with good performances. But I wanted so much for the message to change the world. It can, you know.",6
30 January 2005,"If everyone would ""Pat it Forward"" what a wonderful world it would be","One of my favorite movies because of the message and the morale of the story. We could fix a lot of our world's problems if we took the time like this child did, to go out, make a difference and ""Pay it Forward."" This movie has changed me in a couple of different ways, mostly that when I do stop to help someone, or pay the toll for the guy behind me, etc. I just simply tell them to ""pay it forward"" The song Calling All Angels will have everyone in tears, it is a beautiful song with a beautiful message. The ending of the movie is perfect and makes you really stop and think as you watch the credits roll by. I speak of this movie often, I recommend it to people all the time and it truly is one of the best kept secrets because most of the people I recommend it to, have never heard of it. It is a great movie and one I am proud to own.

23 October 2000,"It's not a perfect world, but it's not awful","This movie did something to me, that many movies try to do to you. It made me cry. First for joy, then for sadness. Real tears. It made me care about their lives, and in essence, helped me care about myself more. I'm not suprized that it's not getting rave reviews from the media, it's not a movie that's going to sell toys or memberships in cool clubs. It's about the suffering of the human condition and how a few people managed to survive each day.

Take someone you love to this movie. You'll love them more when you leave.

Just a note, this movie deals with alcohol recovery a bit, and may seem like it's preaching to those of you in recovery when you first realize that. Don't take it personal, it's just the condition that these people are dealing with. It could be anything that makes life difficult for us all.

25 October 2000,Made it to my top-ten list,"I so rarely see a film that moves and inspires me like this one. It's a gem! I belly-laughed in the film, and on the way home I just balled... and I'm not a big 'movie-crier.' It affected me for days. Great acting, great story, unusual style. So many heros in the world endeavoring to rise above their circumstances and make a change, no matter how small... and this movie goes straight to the heart of that challenge.

It was definitely more serious in some places than I had anticipated -- beware bringing young kids, because of the emotional charge around some of the story line.

Enjoy this gem!

19 July 2001,This could have been better,"This was not a great movie or even a good one, but it was not a bad movie. It had promise, the idea is a really interesting one. The thing is you don't see much of the whole pay it forward idea. The plot of the mother and teacher in love takes over almost the entire movie, I guess the film makers felt it made for a better movie than seeing how this pay it forward movement becomes so popular. Technically it is one of Trevor's good deeds, but still. Actually I think they have a great idea for a movie in here. Take the whole subplot about Jay Mohr's reporter and make THAT into a movie. His scenes were much more interesting than seeing how many problems could be heaped on one family and a teacher. No Helen Hunt or Haley Joel till the end. I know their problems were realistic, but it could get way too melodramatic. If you made the movie with Jay Mohr tracking pay it forwards success across the country and finding Haley Joel that would have been effective in my opinion. You could even used what happened at the end. Plus I (maybe) would have been spared scenes where I swear the film makers were going this scene will win Helen Hunt the oscar for sure!'",5
20 June 2001,Turn it off before it ends!,"This is a classic example of a bad ending tacked on to an otherwise good movie. The story is sappy and a little predictable, but the characters are well acted and genuine, and are able to overcome the schmaltz. However the writers seem to have felt the need to tack on an unnecessary ending in a failed attempt to add weight to the tone of the movie. The movie works fine without the last 5 minutes. If you haven't seen it yet, turn it off early and you'll be happy!

2 March 2001,A 'nice' movie.,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, ever since I saw the trailer, I wasn't disappointed. An excellent cast, however I do think maybe Helen Hunt was not the perfect choice, perhaps someone with a bit less of a 'clean' image would have been better, her character did not seem to take on a stereotypical drunk image, she might as well have been addicted to coffee. However, another thought was, ***NO SPOILER*** in order to balance out the ending, I think it would have been better to concentrate on the people 'paying it forward', than on Kevin Spacey's character, then the ending would not have been disjointed. I would like to have seen a more complete picture on the lengths and sacrifices the people were going through, rather than Kevin Spacey's personal discoveries. Apart from all of that, it was a really nice movie, I enjoyed it. If you are looking for a movie with no violence and easy to watch, then this is it.

16 October 2004,Worst ending to a good film ever,"The first 110 or so minutes of this film are great. They're worthy of a 9 or 9.5. The big three (Spacey, Osment, Hunt) all play their roles beautifully. The concept is original and engaging, the story is uplifting, if a little fantastic a la Forrest Gump, and I was completely absorbed.

Then the ending came. I sat there, first in shock and disbelief, and then in rage and disappointment that some low-life Hollywood stupidhead stuck this trite, melodramatic, heart-string-tugging ending onto it. I actually yelled at the (TV) screen, ""No! How dare you! It was going so well!""

If you think people like Julia Roberts and Matt Leblanc are good actors, then go ahead and see and enjoy this film. Otherwise, stay far, far away.

28 June 2001,Could be better but overall a great film.,"This was a great film overall. I especially liked Kevin Spacey. He played a very touching role. I loved the relationship between his character (Eugene Simmonet) and Arlene McKiney (Helen Hunt). That part made it a truley wonderful movie. Unfortunatly, the whole ""pay it forward"" part of the movie bored the crap out of me. I find myself fast-forwarding through those parts. And yet, the acting for the main characters of the movie was so good that I still watch it again and again. The ideal movie could have been made if they had just called it something else and paid little or no attention to Trevor's assignment. My wish is that they will one day remake this movie the way it should have been. It would still send the same heart-felt message, and without all those painfully boring scenes.

15 November 2001,This is probably the best movie that I've ever seen,"This movie carries a powerful message. Osment, Hunt and Spacey were brilliant as usual. I never cry when movies have tragic endings. I probably wouldn't even cry if I lost my left big toe but this movie had one of the most moving endings that any other movie has ever had. I was even misty-eyed. The only way that you won't like this movie is if you hate one of the main three actors or actresses.

26 July 2002,Decent performances,"Not as thought provocing as the movies producers may have intended. It comes across as a bland americanized flat, butter ridden, piece of Dr. Phil psycho crap about how one individual can change the whole world just by being nice. However, that aside this movie still has some strong performances by it's leading actors. Mr Spacey, Ms Hunt and young Mr Osment all do solid work here. Mr Spacey in particular does a tremendous job, doing very much by doing very little. It's all in the small gestures. But, even if the writers try do shock the audience into thinking otherwise with the tragic fate of the movies do-gooder (failing miserable by adding a further scenes after wich induces severe pains in my stomach), this movie is intended for family viewings, and is because of this very sentimental in it's nature. Too much so in my book.

23 September 2001,Superb Acting,"Superb acting is the great plus in this movie in which the story is rather obvious and the end (though dramatic) is very disappointing The whole movie is Hollywood all the way and the end of the movie just does not fit into the sweetness of the rest of it. I get the point the producers want to make but they strongly give me the idea that they could not choose between making it real drama or a family feelgood film.

The problem wasn't Kevin Spacey's acting, actually it wasn't the acting at all. The story was very believable for most of the movie as well... The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I didn't find it sad or depressing or even life-affirming. I found it tacky and I was expecting it. Two of my favorite movies have been at the hand of Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, The Usual Suspects). Unfortunately for me, this one falls short. Maybe next time Haley.

26 April 2002,I love this movie!,"I thought this film was a very sensitive and well done picture. I loved the characters - they were very finely drawn. Helen Hunt was amazing although it did take me a while to get used to her ""trailer trash"" look. Kevin Spacey - well, he is just wonderful, as are the other actors in the film. The concept ""Pay it Foward"" is one that we could all apply to our everyday lives with positive results. My only other comment - have tissue handy, you'll need it.

8 June 2002,damn good.,"OK. all comments and stupid generic critiquing aside. i usually cannot stand dramas. simply because theyre commonly dry and lacking of any merit whatsoever.

But when you take a really well written story, whether it be a book or a script and you apply ppl who can actually act, you get an amazing product. This movie is definitely a shining example of this. (american Beauty, even K-Pax wasnt bad) ""damn i can only think of spacey movies hehe""

Forget the fact that so-and-so didnt get all the best lines or whats-his-face didnt get a chance to shine in the script.

The story is awesome! i am constantly having arguments/philosophy on this subject and just the odd pondering when im on the bus, or driving through a crappy part of town, or watching ppl kill each other on the news.

i am a person who thinks realistically. this can tend to be negative at times, cuz hey... thats what the world is like. but given the chance i can see the beauty in the world. so such a story as this one is very plausible in my eyes.

forget peace love and flowers... its flakey and no one wants to hear about it anymore. almost everyone with any kind of scruples or a heart finds the way the world is, very disturbing. and you feel like theres nothing one person can do about it. helping 3 ppl in your entire life, on 3 difficult things is changing the world. one tiny little insignifigant piece, but it can spread.

if hatred can spread so easily, why cant kindness?

if you want something to give you a little tiny bit of faith in humanity... watch this movie. its a dope example of what real creativity is, and a cool idea for changing the world.

btw, the ending is hard to stomache, cuz its so cheesy, but the goodness of the rest of the movie makes up for it.",

3 May 2003,"A well-thought out, moving film","I have just finished watching 'Pay it Forward', and I have to say that it is a wonderful film. Not only is the idea of 'paying it forward' ingenious, but the script is well-written, cast members well-chosen, and altogether excellently acted. All the way through, I was expecting a cheesy hollywood moment that would spoil the film, but apart from one or two that came close, it was avoided.

All I can do is recommend this film highly, not only as top-quality entertainment, but also to make you think. Who knows, perhaps people will start by paying it forward. I can only hope that there are those out there who have the dedication to do such a thing.

9 April 2007,Thought Provoking,"Movie viewers often 'over think'(or 'micro-critique') the movie they just watched. They review so many aspects of the movie that they forget that the usual reason for watching a movie is to be entertained for a couple of hours.

I do this myself and the practice usually sours the whole experience.

""Pay It Forward"" is the type of movie that lends itself to such a micro-critique as the theme seems idyllic to the extreme.

The premise presented by the writers is that a boy(Osment)actually believes his efforts at doing good for three troubled people will result in their doing the same for three others...(who will do likewise for an additional three)until the whole world is doing good for one another.

In one scene, the teacher(Spacey)uses the word 'utopian' to describe the boy's goal. As a viewer, I couldn't have agreed moreso. But, then, in a world where 'eat or be eaten' seems the overwhelming theme of mankind in general, the goal of young Osment's character is very refreshing and my mind was quite willing to dwell on that supposition for the remainder of the movie (and for that matter some hours subsequent.)

The actors are all very qualified with more than one Oscar represented in their number.

This is a very thought-provoking movie. One's mind is left with a feeling much the same as a lung full of fresh air produces after spending a day in a stuffy meeting with sweaty co-workers jammed shoulder to shoulder. I enjoyed it and will add it to my movie collection.",7
14 January 2006,Why do scriptwriters change good books?,"I have read the novel and I have to say that I wish scriptwriters would stick to the author's story. The movie was well acted, but was just a ghost of the impact of the book. Shame on you, Catherine Ryan Hyde, for allowing your wonderful novel to be manipulated in this way. What was wrong with keeping the original concept that Trevor's teacher is a badly disfigured Vietnam veteran? And why change his name? As I said, the actors were splendid and the Vegas background was a delight. In the book, Trevor was honoured by the President of the United States, so why does the movie leave the impression that Trevor's beautiful idea to promote love and compassion is not as successful as he might have wished?

27 April 2002,Less than the sum of its parts,"When I think of any part of this film, I am quite impressed by it. It's got a great story, for the most part well-written script, nice direction, a-list cast in top form, pretty camera work despite the gritty location - the list goes on. The only thing about the film which put me off was the soundtrack, which was engaging for about five minute and then annoying for the rest of the film. In spite of all these great bits, it disappoints, badly. I was completely unaffected by the ending, and felt that the film was ultimately, strangely bloodless.

3 November 2000,What's up with the homophobia?,"Early in the movie a friend of the main character calls a bully a ""f*g"". Later he gets beaten up for it, and the consequences of this lead to the film's conclusion. I know that kids call each other ""f*g"" and ""f****t"" all the time, but why would adult filmmakers put that in a movie without including any non-homophobic elements as well? The only gay character is a pedophile!

I don't know what to make of this. Do the filmmakers have an axe to grind about gay men? Or are they just oblivious? The only charitable read I could possibly give the movie is that the story was a convoluted demonstration of the tragedy that arises from homophobia. But somehow I doubt that's what anyone involved in the film's production had in mind.

11 June 2001,Why didn't I know about this film when it came out?,"Granted, I really don't keep up with current movies, but I'd rather have known of the existence of this one than of Deuce Bigalow or Me, Myself, and Irene. Sure mindless films have their place, but I'd like to see some promotional budget go to a movie that has genuine potential to change the world.

That said, I don't think this film is destined for greatness, at least not as a film. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt were great, but they didn't redefine themselves or anything. I still think of Helen Hunt from As Good as It Gets. And the Thomas Newman soundtrack in this film really doesn't help to distance Kevin Spacey from American Beauty. The story moves slowly and really relies on some studio standards to pull the heart strings. I thought I was watching Field of Dreams as the picture ended.

The concept is the key. Just having a term for the notion of paying it forward has power. For that concept to reach a mass market could mean a change in cultural thought process. ""You may call me a dreamer, but I'm not the only one...

20 October 2000,YOUR WEEKEND ASSIGNMENT IS TO SEE THIS MOVIE.,"It's a little early to be whistling the Oscar kazoo, but Pay it Forward does deserve attention - at least from audiences.

The concept is bright and bold, centering around young Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) as he bakes a plan to revolutionize society. Help three people in a very big way, then those three people will aid three more. (#1 - It has to be something that really helps people. #2 - Something they can't do by themselves.) Don't pay it back - ""pay it forward!""

Though, every pyramid plan depends on the participation of those that are given favors, so once Trevor's Big Three are enacted, he begins to fear none of them were successful - or the disillusionment of youth, the first of a few major themes the film tackles. Enter Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey), the heart-filled, dictionary-totting seventh grade social studies teacher who assigned each of his students the world-changing, semester long think piece.

Although, Trevor was the only pre-teen to conceive something truly inventive - and, eventually, the movement screams across the Las Vegas border onto the streets of L.A. A freelance writer chasing the story (Jay Mohr) defines it as a ""movement,"" and that is what it is, both spiritual and helpful.

Arlene, Trevor's protective mother that chugs Abolut when nobody is peeking; Ricky, Trevor's neglecting, estranged father keeps propping up after years on the bottle; and Grace, Trevor's loving yet homeless grandmother that lives in the scrap yard of gamblin' town add conflict to an already hefty script. Running at a bit over two hours, Pay it Forward is, simply stated, an experience of drama, humor and pain.

It is the type of film built as a mantel piece. It's not perfect - not shatterproof - but it does provide a solid entertainment roller coaster ride of emotions. So don't beckon ""Oscars"" yet, just pay eight bucks, sit back comfortably in your favorite movie-watching row, munch on a few Swedish Fish - then ""pay it forward.""",
3 November 2000,A good story but a bit overacted and smarmy,"The story behind this movie is good, but watching it tends to grate a bit as they use formulaic tear-jerk sequences and the actors tend to get a bit too dramatic as the film progresses.

I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie unless it's easy for you to ignore emotionally manipulative Hollywood formulae and actors that are trying just a bit too hard

25 August 2001,Paying it forward to the director,"In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

3 November 2000,I've never cried more in my life,"This movie was absolutely incredible. You are missing out if you don't see it and tell everyone you know to see it too. This movie offered up so much hope in human goodness and truly showed how important a single act of kindness can in a world where people are generally to busy to care anymore. The acting is amazing, Helen Hunt portrayed her character ingeniously and Haley Joel Osmont is unbelievable for his age. The raw emotion and purity of the message in this movie is priceless. I will never get tired of seeing this movie. I gave this movie a 10. PLEASE see it!!!!

6 July 2001,Really good touching -- but sad -- film about one boy's life.,"This is a really sad story about a boy that gets a bad hand dealt to him, but tries to make the best of it by changing the world with his ""Pay It Forward"" project. This is in par with all of Haley Joel Osment movies such as ""Sixth Sense"", and should be under the same category. I voted for this movie with a 10, because it really is a good story, excellent acting, and perfect timing. If your looking for a movie to watch, ""Pay It Forward"" is on DVD, VHS, and Pay-Per-View!

15 October 2000,Story line spoils a would-be Oscar grand-slam,"Those who sit down to this slightly longer than two-hour film will be treated to excellent performances by each of the A-list artists: Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment. Sound direction by Mimi Leder and adequate technical execution would complete this cinematographic triumph, but neither the king's horses nor the Academy's nominees can put this humpty-dumpty of a story back together after the tragically predictable climax.

The child-like idealism reflected in the main plot -- a seventh grader's efforts to meet the challenge of his social studies teacher and change the world -- is tempered by the childly innocence of its proponent. Combined with a practical exposition on the potential impact on children of substance abusing parents, the story is not only entertaining but socially pertinent. The climax, however, can be easily predicted by an attentive viewer, and its melodramatic execution undermines the overall quality of the film, in sharp contrast to the understated conclusion of last year's American Beauty.

This moderate flaw does not diminish the expected superiority of the acting, which one hopes will lead Master Osment to a deserved Oscar and add golden statuettes to the mantles of Hunt and Spacey. I suspect, however, that the imperfection will disqualify the film from winning Best Picture.",
5 November 2000,"what is this movie, really?","It seems like there are many people that like this movie and many others that do not. I am still undecided. What this movie really is, is a blend of two decades of work. The 80's karate kid pump you up feel good go team. And the 90's the world is a horrible place, people are weird and there is nothing you can do. Unfortunately, this combination does not flow well. It is like the ending to City of Angels with Nic Cage, if you are a true sentimentalist you will like it but if you have the ounce of that is not the way the world works you will feel the story leap to a 'Hollywood' ending and be put out.

15 September 2001,"Unnecessary ""crap""","I felt like the ending was awful, I also think that they added (as they do in MANY movies) more garbage that is totally unnecessary so they could get the ratings. I guess people like to see the violence etc.

I went away from the movie just sick to my stomach and thinking ""well, that's two hours of my life I will never see again""

22 October 2000,Are there really kids like this?,"Pay It Forward has caused me to look around in my world for kids facing situations similar to the character played by Haley Joel Osment and I ask, ""Are there really kids like this?"" Yes, there really are kids like this - who face family, school and social situations - that seem unbearable. And yes, there are kids like this who have to care for themselves (and sometimes those around them). And definitely, yes there are kids who choose to see life in a different light and take action to make it better. Now I have to ask, ""Where are the adults who can relate to this boy and help these kids? (like Kevin Spacey's character - Eugene)

I enjoyed this movie - even when it pulled at my emotions. No, let me restate that. I enjoyed this movie - because it pulled at my emotions. But tell me ... is not media (TV, Movie, Music, Advertising) about that very same thing? Our emotions get manipulated every time you interact with the world. If you walk away from this movie without any reaction ... then you just don't get it.

I like this movie because it didn't try to cover up what kind of life this boy faced. I like this moved because it presented an unbelievable and somewhat unachievable challenge to the boy - and he accepted it. I like this movie because it causes me to think. And that is something that many other movies fail to do.

The writers, directors, producers and actors should get recognition (not criticism) for attempting to cause people to not just think ... but take action to change this world.",
9 October 2000,"too sentimental to be great, or even good for that matter...","Too much sentimentality. It ruins the film. The performances are good, but the script is so bad that even Academy Awardwinners can't save this film. That said, there are a few AMAZING scenes in this film that make it worth seeing. The romance between Spacey and Hunt is the greatest strength and weakness of the film.

But see it anyway for its good parts.

23 October 2000,Kevin Spacey is fabulous as always!,"This movie makes you want to go out and ""Pay It Forward"". It is a simple concept, yet it seems so unattainable.

Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt have a chemistry that is seldom seen. Joel Haley Osmont shows a maturity much beyond his age. This is a movie you will want to watch again and again.

26 October 2000,The way it affected me after it was over.,"I went to see this film not only because all of the wonderful actors in it that I have seen in previous movies but of the premise of the movie thanks to the trailers. Little did I know that it was going to be such a ""heart wrenching"" film. After the movie was over, I went to the washroom and stood inside a stall and just balled by eyes out. The last time I felt something like that was during Titanic.

I recommend this movie to everyone. I'm a single mom with a son so maybe it hit me extra hard. I heard men even using their kleenex that night including the one I was with.

I think we all should ""Pay It Forward"" some how, some way.

7 October 2000,One precocious 7th grader awakens adults to big ambitions.,"In nicely spare dialogue, this broken home story toys with chronology and prods its audience to savor an interconnection in a wide sector of individuals' behaviors. Frail characters often sparkle with promise, then disappoint themselves. If they recover, seem to see the light, then suffer anew. Crafty editing brings lovely surprises, never quite tidying up many scenes, letting viewers dangle in fascination. This film is tart and tasty, an entree that displays how a female director can bring fresh insights to domestic storytelling.

25 October 2000,A Disappointing Film,"Unfortunately, I really looked forward to seeing Pay It Forward. There's nothing like anticipation to boost expectations to unreachable levels. How can you go wrong with Spacey, Hunt, and Osment? Well, I'll tell you: Make Helen Hunt revamp her character from As Good As It Gets, and have Haley Joel Osment be practically the same child that he was in The Sixth Sense. The concept of Pay It Forward is great--as the tagline says, do nice things for three people, and have them pass it on...too bad this great idea got swallowed up in a standard Hollywood formula. Throw in the love story. (Vomit, vomit). And then make the ending so disgusting, so horrible, so unmentionable. I probably would have liked the movie if not for the total cop-out ending. Why let a movie end respectably when you can add a ton of melodramatic schmaltz? All in all, this already mediocre movie was completely ruined by its closing scenes. Two and a half stars.

5 November 2000,"Osment, Hunt, Spacey: The new silver screen dream team","Pay It Forward, a movie whose plot relies on a 7th grade Social Studies assignment. Seem too juvenile or ""hokey"" for you? Think again. This movie has you hooked from the beginning. The emotional scenes cause tears to fall from your eyes, and the sophisticated quips of Mr. Simonet (Spacey) leave you laughing at the ignorance of the Las Vegas youth in his class. There are also many mysteries that when solved lead to some of the most emotionally touching scenes I think I've ever seen in a movie. Not to mention appearances by Jon Bon Jovi, Jay Mohr, and a reprise from the Sixth Sense: Haley Joel Osment in his underwear (just kidding). This movie is a definite 10. It holds the power of Spacey's American Beauty, without the profanities, obscenities, and cruel themes. A must see that will change your way of thinking forever.

24 October 2000,A Breath of Fresh Air,"In a day and age where violence and special effects are the norm, this movie presents us with a much different movie. The story has a simple, interesting and promising theme: Help out three other people, and only ask them to help three others in return.

I guess what makes this film so enjoyable is that this movie could happen in real life. It's quite inspiring, and after watching this, I want to do something nice for strangers. Even if it's to a smaller scale such as random acts of kindness (pay the next 5 vehicle's toll) or giving up a bus seat to an elderly person, it can still make someone's day.

I can't think of a better kid (Osment) or better teacher (Spacey) to play their respective roles. Their sincerely really shines through in the dialogue. Helen Hunt does a very good job as the concerned mother who has her problems, but develops quite nicely through them. Indeed, it's a very nice ensemble.

They say timing is everything, and it's about time a movie came out like this. Bravo.

9 June 2001,From the eyes of a child comes a brilliant vision,"This movie Is by far one of the greatest works I have ever had the privilege of watching. All of the cast gave Oscar worthy performances in my opinion. But even with such well done acting, that still becomes secondary. The story is what really shines. It isn't an impossible dream. And it wasn't presented as if it were. Everything that takes place in this film can. And should, save for one event at the end of the movie. But as I see it, an event such as happened in the closing scenes may be what needs to take place to make the world wake up, and start Paying It Forward. Hats off the the writer(s) of this film. I now know that it is based on a book. I intend to buy, and read it. I CAN highly recommend this film to anyone. It WILL touch your heart! Because of that,I intend to Pay It Forward.

22 January 2002,A teacher's worthy assignment; students noble charge.,"It should come as no surprise to those who have followed the career of Kevin Spacey that Pay It Forward should be yet another wonderful success. Well, that's exactly what it is. From the opening to the closing credits music, this one grabs you and simply won't let go. I'm not going into any details, as I don't won't to spoil a single second of the experience, except to say that this is one of those rare films that can actually change your life. I know it did mine. I intend to use it along with components from The Fifth Discipline in our place of business to shake things up for the better. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor --- maybe even your boss --- and pick up a copy of PIF and find out just what is possible when humankind puts the ol' grey matter to it. Enjoy!

22 October 2000,Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for this film...,"Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for this film. Normally I would pay double admission to watch Kevin Spacey play second triangle in a symphony orchestra. The film represented a good premise, not reall well expanded upon. Haley Joel Osment was great, Spacey was his usual, Helen Hunt perhaps a little one dimensional, but the real difficulty I had was with the film plotline. I found the storyline very predictable and the plot turns annoyingly manipulative.

I think I had the only dry eye in the theatre at the end, unusual for me. Am I in left field or does anyone else feel this way?

8 October 2000,"Wonderful, uplifting and realistic movie","I just saw a preview of this movie in Las Vegas. Not only is it very realistic portrayal of the city and its people, but it is also well acted, an uplifting story and all around good movie. This is as good a movie about Las Vegas as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and its message is as good as the Christmas movie ""It's a wonderful life"". All parents should take their children to see the movie and discuss it with them. All alcoholics should see it and all battered women with children. All teachers should recommend this movie and give that assignment in class. I hope it will be a big box office success and that all three main actors will get rewarded for their performances.

9 October 2000,A modern after-school special,"Despite this film's considerable pre-Oscar buzz, Pay It Forward chokes on its own heavy-handed melodrama. All three principal actors (Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osmet, Helen Hunt) are solid, but the script pulls out a string of cliches and offers an embarrassing amount of racial stereotypes in the background. Plus, its suggestion that simply helping people can change the world is noble but ultimately rings hollow as a beauty pageant speech. Spacey is aguably the best actor in Hollywood today, but he can't save this sapfest from drowning.

10 October 2000,Phenomenal movie; a true hit; sure to be remembered as one of the years best!!,"Every aspect of this movie was spectacular. Acting, plot and screenplay were all superb. This will be remembered as one of the best movies of the year. Haley Joel Osment, returns with another brilliant performance. This is probably the first movie in a very long time that I had fewer than two complaints about.

Pay it forward was one of the most original movies thus far this year. Mimi Leder used a great style of directing to blend the original story with an intriguing and successful style of telling the tale which kept the audience interested throughout. All to often original ideas are lost in movies that just tell a story without making any effort at originality and excitement and keeping the audience interested, resulting in a boring movie. How you tell the story is at least as important as the story itself. Pay it forward does not make the mistake of forgetting this.

The director successfully blends first rate performances not only by the movies stars, but also by the supporting cast, who turned in equally brilliant performances. The performances of the lead actors, Hunt, Spacey and Osment, were also different than their past performances and acting styles. It is refreshing to see actors shine not as one role performers but in different varied roles that require them to display the full range of their acting abilities.

Even those who have not been swept away by the past performances of this trio will still thoroughly enjoy this movie.",10
16 October 2000,a very touching movie,"I am lucky to see this film just 7 days before its formal release. This emotional drama tells a touching story. KS, HH and Haley did a good job, especially in the moments when Trevor is in the front of the tape-recorder. I think this film deserves an Oscar.

I mean, come on, how depressing can you possibly make 1 movie? 1 tragedy after another, and it gets to the point that you just quit caring and want the movie to end.

I gave it 4 out of 10, but even that is generous.

The three actors turn in top rated performances which will atleast get one of them an Oscar nomination. (Haley is deserved) The only thing wrong with this movie was that it was a little long.

17 October 2000,"Thick Message, Thin Movie","I had the opportunity to see this movie at a recent screening, and I was very upset. We have come to expect BIG things from Leder, and I just was not satisfied with this movie. The performances from Osment, Spacey, and Hunt were very, very good as expected, but the movie itself lacked in pacing, character development, and overall continuity. The dialogue was horrific, upfront, and obvious. The plot peeled like an onion, but the pay-off was minimal. Also, I continually found myself in a state of disbelief regarding scenes, characters, and outcomes. Although the message was bold and invigorating (and a bit overdone), the movie itself failed to convey such a lofty theme. In short, the movie failed to captivate me, and I left the theatre knowing I should have rented that video as planned.

I would recommend this film over any other because it carries a lesson that is greatly needed in our world today.

20 October 2000,Better than I expected,"I was looking to get out of the house. Middle of the day. Figured I'd see a movie. I hadn't planned on seeing this movie, the previews didn't look too appealing, and the name sounds like a fast food restaurant promotion.

Despite my negative expectation, I have to admit that I liked this movie. I'm not really a Kevin Spacey fan, and I can take or leave Helen Hunt. I guess I'm just a sucker for touching movies. Anyone that says this movie wasn't worth seeing should lighten up and get over their disappointments with life.

I give this flick a ""Must See"" rating. The kid did an excellent job, and I expect he will have a bright future in Hollywood.

Just make sure to ask for popcorn without the butter, butter kills!

23 October 2000,I really wanted to like this movie...,"What a disappointment. This movie starts off so promisingly (if a bit stereotypically), but things slide downhill after the first hour. Hunt, Spacey, and Osment perform admirably; the problem is, they aren't given characters to play, and they know it.

In retrospect, this movie suffers from trying to be so different from the book on which it is based. Details are changed between book and movie, details that don't seem to benefit the change, and it appears the screenwriter was tripped up by these changes.

The movie never gets past its message. That message is fantastic; the gaping story holes and overt melodrama hurt the message. This movie doesn't want to touch you; it wants to beat you over the head until you sob.

The performances are fine, although during his Big Melodramatic Speech, it appears that Spacey realizes just how ridiculous he sounds. Hunt is convincing, but again, is given so little with which to work. Osment's acting is up to his usual standard--but he again plays the weepy, sad child of a single mother. Could someone get this kid a movie without dead people, crying, and an absent father?

Unless you're going in as a Spacey, Hunt, and/or Osment fan (as I did), don't waste the $7.00 to see this. Hit a matinee or wait for the video. And bring tissues, because unless you're able to be completely disgusted by the manipulation of your emotions, you'll sob at the last (contrived, over-done, and unrealistic) 15 minutes.",6
23 October 2000,"My opinion of the movie, not a professional critique, by any means.","This movie seems to be getting unfairly maligned, and by so many people, it's depressing. That so many people find it ""sappy"" or ""emotionally overblown"" in itself indicates the very point of the movie--that the world sucks. Personally, I think this is the best movie I've seen in my life, because never before have I seen a movie combine the right balance of humorous and dramatic elements. I'm of the opinion that people criticize the admittedly heavy-handed melodrama because the movie uses this very melodrama to illustrate that the truth often hurts. In this case, the truth means that it's a lot easier to hurl snide, sarcastic comments at a very well-intentioned plot line than to actually take the film's altruistic message to heart, get off your butt and do something to try to change your world. At least, most people seem to think the acting was decent, which is very nice of them to say, considering they don't seem to think much of the film itself. I don't know that much about acting, but obviously I think the acting was perfect, and very effective at getting a relevant point across. If it takes what critics would call ""sappiness"" to wake people up, so be it. For myself, I intend to take its message very seriously, and I hope there are at least a few others out there who will do the same.

24 October 2000,"Luckily for me, the theater had to be evacuated (SPOILERS, probably)","In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7.

24 October 2000,Oscar mumur,"Pay It Forward is not bad. But that doesn't make it a great movie. This is a bit of a let down after seeing some of the other great roles that Kevin Spacey has excelled at performing. Here his shine can be seen at times, but other times it seems as though he has been misdirected. The movie as a whole seems to be built upon cheese. Many scenes that should have been more powerful were made to be simply kitchy. The character development also should have been taken farther. In all it was an enjoyable movie, it did have a neat story line and was heart warming, but I don't think it warrants the (premature) Oscar hype that it is getting.

24 October 2000,it was terrible,"I just got back from this movie, and I am sorry, but I really really hated it. First of all, too much hype. You can't put all these so-called great actors together and expect them to pull off some amazing Oscar performance. Also, this movie was so slow, Jay Moore had a stupid role, Kevin Spacey was a major WHIMP, and Haley Joel Osment was a manipulative brat!! And another thing, this theme in the movie of ""paying it forward"" is not a new thing. Hello folks, it's called a random act of kindness...jeeeezzzzz I cannot stress how terrible this movie was. I want you all to know that I wanted to love this movie. You see, I love Kevin Spacey....LOVE HIM!! I also really liked Haley. But after this piece of c**p I have lost so much respect for them that I once had. I only hope that they can make a good movie after this and gain back their respect.

19 June 2001,What have we learned?,"I've heard a lot of people say this movie teaches a lesson. I fail to see what that is. This is another example of a basically good movie (with terrific performances) that is ruined by an overdose of melodrama. Hopefully, I won't give too much away for those who haven't seen it yet, but the ending completely negates the original message. The movie goes abruptly from preaching ""one person can make a difference"" and ""small efforts can bring about big changes"" to ""no good deed goes unpunished"".

1 June 2002,Not sentimental rubbish!,"I saw this film, expecting a light hearted soppy movie. I'm not keen on 'chick flicks' or anything that seems designed to make people say 'aww'. My ideas were actually based on the cover image of the video box - it was all too sugary sweet for my liking but I thought there were worse ways of spending two hours.

My image of the film was completely wrong. It angers me that people dismiss it as being sentimental and ultimately meaningless, because it just isn't! I don't see how a film that is so well acted and thought provoking could be labelled in such a way. I don't like films that patronise me, and I'm glad to say, this one didn't.

The one part of the film that I disliked was the whole Kevin Spacey facial disfigurement thingy. It was such an obvious metaphor for his 'emotional pain' and his character seemed rather stereotyped, but in the end I warmed to him despite this.

The ending affected me. I was brought in and was very involved by the film. I thought about the film after watching it, just as I have with other ones I like (e.g Fight Club, Vanilla Sky).

Watch the film and make up your own mind. Don't be put off by cynics!",9
30 October 2000,pay it forward to your friends and tell them NOT to see this,"honestly, this movie was abysmal. helen hunt wasn't believable as a trashy vegas barmaid/casino worker. kevin spacey regurgitated his ""woe is me"" performance from ""american beauty"" (and they used the same music from ""american beauty"" in ""pay it forward""! whatever happened to originality?) haley joel osment tried his hardest but in the end is just a freckle faced, doe-eyed vehicle for sap, and don't even get me started on the ending... all in all, i didn't care about the characters and i especially felt that jay mohr was an obnoxious useless addition to the film. the whole plot was contrived and depressing. i can see how some people would like this movie, and i can see how others would hate it. but i guess you can say that about any movie. personally, i am ""paying it forward"" to at least three people by telling them to save their money and avoid this movie, at least until it comes out on video. as for the oscar buzz, let's hope that it doesn't come to fruition. on a final note, james caviezel was actually pretty good as jerry, a homeless man. but even he isn't worth the $8.50.

It has 2 oscar winners (Kevin spacey and Helen Hunt) their acting its ok but i dont think their papers were for getting another oscar, and Haley acted better in the 6th since he was very good in this one but no, no oscar for you lil' dude.

This is a modern day retelling of its a Wonderful Life. Everyone should see this movie, its sad funny, and most of all true to life. It inspires the magic in us all by using the human sprit and nothing more, accompanied by a great score, and wonderful cinematography.

3 November 2000,Tearjerker!,"Before I even walked into the movie theatre, those walking out were all wiping their eyes dry. ""Uh-oh"" were the first words out of my mouth. What was I in for? I found out 2 hours later as I became one of those wiping my eyes. Do not let this discourage you from seeing this movie. You will regret it when the Oscars come up again and you don't know what movie they're talking about. It is yet another steller performance from three of Hollywood's latest big stars -- Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment and Helen Hunt.

And the award goes to . . . the best movie since American Beauty, and one that will rank with others like Forrest Gump, Titanic and other tearjerkers -- yet this one outdoes those hands down. The message is wonderful and one we should all embrace.

7 August 2003,Bittersweet movie with superb acting,"This is a fine movie, well worth watching. The best part is the acting by the movie's three stars, especially Haley Joel Osment. This kid is amazing, and brings every movie he's in to another level.

The storyline was more interesting than I expected and the movie was shot beautifully.

A few parts were hard to believe and the ending was a little hard to swallow, but overall the movie is immensely satisfying and I never tire of watching it.

It is not what I would call a feel-good movie. It takes a heart-wrenching look at various social problems such as homelessness, domestic violence, school violence, and alcoholism, yet never loses its sense of optimism.

24 May 2001,Something truly worthy from art and entertainment,"We have all heard the line about art being an expression created by man that adds to the quality life by touching the soul in some way. Pay It Forward is one of those rare films that can be classified as truly worthy art. The story is engaging and timelessly relevant. The message of hope and faith in humanity is powerful and should touch us all deeply right where we live. Don't miss this film. More importantly, don't miss the opportunity to open your mind and heart to the possibilities from the idea it presents.

18 November 2001,A heartfelt tearjerker,"Along the lines of director Mimi Leder's blockbuster Deep Impact and the good natured Patch Addams, Pay It Forward is a well done, superbly acted, and heartfelt drama- but a definite tearjerker nonetheless. One critic commented that it felt as if the director was throwing tear gas grenades into the audience; indeed, the tumultous content and wrenching finale succeed in enhancing the hopeful messages of this memorable film, but they also yank a little too hard on viewers' emotions in the process. Be forewarned- it's a bittersweet film whose quest to be deeply moving will seem delightfully successful for some, annoyingly overdone for others.

27 June 2001,Inspirational!,"The critics have not been kind in their appraisal of this unique and multidimensional movie that is without a doubt one of the most inspirational movies I have seen in my lifetime.

This story will capture your heart no matter what your background IMHO. It transcends race, religion, color and creed. You need only be human to be touched profoundly by this extraordinary film.

Of course, there are always those that ""don't get it"" however, I think most folks will absolutely love this remarkable and insightful voyage into the realities of the human condition.

For me, that's how life should be for *all* of us. Without giving too much away I'll just say that I believe if we all lived our lives this way EVERY day and didn't limit our goodwill (I don't want to give the story line away) what a great place the world would be to live in.

MOST people won't of course, - but that doesn't stop you and I.

The acting was superb all round, and I think Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey both stretched their creative abilities enormously and waded into uncharted waters in their characterizations of the mother and the teacher roles.

Everyone in this movie is initally a member of the walking wounded, not unlike most of us. Life is tough, let's face it. Yet the love of a child was able to help them heal those wounds, and that's something I can relate to personally as can many people I know.

I also loved the Jane Sibery song ""Calling All Angels."" She does a hauntingly beautiful rendition of it and I can't think of a more perfect signature tune for this story.

If you get a chance to view this movie, - take it! You'll be glad you did.",10

30 October 2006,I highly recommended this movie!,"I usually watch the movie ""Pay It Forward"" so that this is heart-meaning and tragedy. Amazingly, I didn't realize that ending! I prefer movie that have good plots and actors like this movie. I had ever seen that kind of movie which is a boy is trying to help people who are around him to do it so as social studies homework. However, some happening are change his life. Those actors are really cool when they in this movie because they seem so natural. The director of this movie is also done well. She rearranged the story not the order but when we see it we can make connect hole of the story in our head. The means when we watch it we always focus on the screen.

The boy's character touches everyone,he's trying so hard to make the world a better place.I think the movie shows what we can do for change the world better. In our world helping other people ""Pay it forward"" is the most important we can do. It is not only a moving story. Everybody who sees this film think our life again. I like story but I don't like only ending. It was so sad. When I become a teacher, I will show it to children.

2 August 2001,what a wonderful idea,"i had been putting off seeing this movie for a long time

but tonight i couldn't find anything better to rent tomorrow i won't be able to find anything better period! this is a very emotional and touching movie i cried at the end. thats something i can't say i've done in a long time.

this movie poses a question to you when you watch it and when you think about it

what could happen if i actually tried to help someone else for no other reason than to make their life better. and asked them to do the same thing for someone else. this world could be a great place. i think i might just try it, and i hope you do to. who knows it could be really cool. watch this movie! it will make you laugh,cry, and best of all think (i agree with the above,, that critic didn't know what he was talking about if he didn't love this movie) i sure did. i hope you do too",10
6 August 2001,a great movie,"this is one of the best among the best movies. the idea behind it- is terrific. But , there is a but, the ending of the movie seemed a little awkward to me. The movie had to end that way to fill the gap of the idea - that is understood but I can't totally buy it. but anyway , it is uniqe to me, and that is very rare these days. everything is played out. I am going to give it a 9.2 out of 10. I hope someone out there gives this movie a physical form.

12 August 2001,"""It's your big chance to fix something that's not like your bike, you can fix a person.""","In 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, my class and I talked about it and what was disturbing to us. I mentioned how everyone thinks it's impossible to make a better world, but is it? I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction. Didn't happen.

I recently watched Pay It Forward, watching it broke my heart because I felt for Haley Jole Osmond's character, hoping your idea would work and it didn't. Just wanting to make something better and you know it's so hard but you just have to try. This is a terrific movie that deserves more praise and I am hurt by a rating of 6.7. I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2000 if not the best. We could all learn from this film.

4 November 2001,An incredible movie!,"This movie inspires so much thought and kindness in everyone who watches it. It is so creative, moving, awe-inspiring- no words can describe how wonderful it is. And they got the perfect people to play the roles. This is Haley Joel Osment's best performance yet, not to mention Helen Hunt. And Kevin Spacey-he's always fantastic. So to wrap it up, I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.

3 June 2007,If everyone lived this way the world would be a better place.,"HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK OF DOING SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE? HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU ACTUALLY DO WHAT YOU WERE THINKING? This film is a lesson that all could learn from young and old. We as a human race in general do not stop even to do thing for ourself, let alone for someone else. This film shows that paying it forward will end up paying you back someday in many ways. We are caught up in a world of hurry up and get it done, or hurry and get where you are going. So how many times have we stopped and thought about others and the needs that are never asked for, but that we as a person could see need to be done. Helping other is a gift that is to be shared and given freely. Just a smile, hello, open a door or pick up something that is dropped is just a start. It gets easier to help others as time goes by, you do not even have to think about it.

22 July 2007,"Great movie, a must see for all.","This is a masterpiece, I would like to give it a teen but I can't as it lacks some in the photography and visual bit to really stand out. The acting is also superb, but it is a bit to clear cut characters to really stay with you after the movie. I would expect some more from such great actors as Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment and Kevin Spacey. But the story is quite compelling and makes you think a real deal about society today.

My strong recommendation is: see it, think about it and react.

Another title I recommend purely on the basis that it is a intelligent film that makes you think are, Gattaca.

27 February 2002,"Good Acting Good story, but a smidge cheesy in the end.","I would like to start out by saying that Kevin Spacey Is a phenominal actor and The little boy is quiet good aswell. However, Helen Hunt sucks a big one and The movie would have been a 9 in my book had she not been in it. Also, it got a little cheesy and predictable at the end, but it still had an impact on me and I think that is one huge factor when concidering how good a movie is.

4 August 2008,Pay It Forward - Let's try it at least once,"I was really impressed by this movie. It's not hard to find people who are really ready to help others, as everybody has some goodness in them.

Sometimes we fail to do the right things, sometimes we are hesitant to do the same. Why don't we break that barrier and just try at least once doing it? Yes, it's tough to do something very big to change one's life, but not impossible as said in this film...

STOP complaining about the things that are wrong, and START taking some initiatives to change them, correct them, and make this world a better place to live. Let's give it a try, after all it's not a crime...

I'm going start and see myself whether it really works. If it does, I'll let you know what happened. I think I will be satisfied even if that works out with one of the three people i'm going to try. I may not achieve big things at the end of it, but I hope I will get some new good friends. After all, you are going to take only their Love, Care and Affection with you when you leave this world.

PAY IT FORWARD - at least once",10
21 October 2002,The most relevant and meaningful movie of this new century,"The morning after an enjoyable evening with my husband and his classmates at his high school reunion in New Jersey, I was taken aback by the unexpected impact ""Pay It Forward"" had on me as we began watching it in our motel room. This is truly a very remarkable film which instantly pulls the viewer into a world where the dignity of the human spirit is affirmed and revered in spite of the anger and injustice which seek to destroy it. I tend to intentionally avoid most newer films as they generally focus on and almost celebrate the depravity of society (even in their heroes). Such films leave one angry, fearful or numb - three emotions I find dehumanizing.

Not being a film critic, I can not speak in detail on a critical level. I found the acting exemplary and the directing superb. This combined with a phenomenal screen play made for a truly extraordinary viewing experience. Anyone who is not seriously moved and on some level changed by this film is to be pitied, for they have lost the very elements of compassion, respect and enlightenment which separates us from lower primates. If the movie industry replaced its current degenerative fare with more films of this nature, the power of such a trend would ""pay it forward"" to our society in unfathomable ways.",10
31 October 2002,Who is the better actor/actress,"I watched this film on a movie channel and I was not really interested at first. I decided to watch the first 10 minutes to see if it gripped me. It did.

The superlative acting talents of Haley Joel Osmont, Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey helped make this film enjoyable.

The story can be seen as a sort of parody of the really gifted youngster who does not have a voice with which to show his talent. However this is not the case. The idea the Trevor (Haley Joel Osmont) has in the film is a unique one and we follow the trail of a journalist trying to find the origin of the Pay It Forward scheme. So that consumes some of the film.

The changes the characters go through are excellently played and I really did spend a lot of the time trying to figure out who was the better actor from the 3 starring roles.

9 December 2002,A very touching movie.,"'Pay it Forward' is a very emotional movie. Many parts of the movie hit me really hard. I found that there was a very good plot and every character learned a lot from the child. The characters also seemed very real and they made their parts very believable. I also enjoyed the fact that Helen Hunt was a main character. She is an unbelievable actress. No matter what part she plays she always seem to succeed in making the story better.

If I had to pick one part in the movie that was not as great then I would have to say that I wanted to know what happened to Jim and the lady that were on the bridge. Did they end up going for coffee? Did she jump? I mean, it totally leaves me hanging. I think it would be nice if they would have wrapped up that portion of the movie as well. That scene alone was poorly done. It seemed to pop out of no where sort of. I did not see the point to it but that is probably because they did not conclude that scene. They should have at least been shown at the end with the others that were there.

Besides this minor screw up though, it was an awesome movie. I'm not sure if I would see it again because it is a real tear jerker but it has a lot to teach people. All around, the actors and actresses were great and the plot was fantastic. I just think it is so cool that a boy with a big heart can touch so many people. This is definitely a movie that I recommend to all of you out there.",
5 January 2003,Greatest Message about Challenges kids face today,"This Movie consists of a message society cannot hear too much about right now. With Bullying, Violence, both in Schools and at home at an all time high; along with global fear about terrorism - there cannot be too many movies with this theme. I loved the song at the end -- and even though there may have been a few scmalzy moments they were far and few between compared to the actual power of the message.

Thankyouto the Producers, directors, and actors for an Incredible show.

Kids, Parents, and Bully's everywhere should watch this and take the same school assignment home with them.

29 July 2003,short to the point,"This is a film about a simple idea that has the potential to bring out the best in the people that you would least expect it from.

The plot is simple yet complex, there is a wide range of emotions explored, from complete joy to total sadness. The main characters, played by Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment, were completely brilliant and as ever spell binding to watch.

I would recommend this film to those searching for a great film filled with emotion.

5 August 2003,reality bites,"you know why everyone hates the ending to this movie? its because that's how life really is and no one wants to admit it. life is full of pain and suffering no matter how much hope a person may have. so many innocent hearts bleed each and every day, and that is their reality. this movie touched my heart with the selfless spirit of Trevor, no matter how much he suffered himself.

A boy, who changes peoples live and recieves nothing in return must have something wrong with him to do all this for people that he doesn't even know. I gave it a ten because it made me cry and feel things that i have never felt about a movie in my life. Changing another persons life has always been my dream, and i intend to do that. i have recieved a challenge from my teacher to do a project on paying it forward. i took the challenge and i intend to do what i can to change peoples lives and want nothing in return. I do these thing anyways... i am a very generous person, and i give things away... wanting nothing in return.

27 June 2004,Am I confused?,"After I watched that film the first time this night on German TV (ARD, state TV, no commercial breaks) I was confused a bit. In that way that I didn't know (and don't) what to feel. So I did something not very logic but reading comments of other viewers and compare them with the fragments of my confused feelings. I think the ending of that film, including the quick and short end titles, made me so confused. (quick and short ending titles taste like B-class TV-movie either). It seems that the plot had to compare with a playtime limit in any way, so the ending got squeezed and shortened but tear flushing however. That's my possibly weird subjective opinion.

I am a very fresh Osment fan, the situation is full of random elements. 25 hours ago I watched A.I. the first time, it impressed me. I love Kubrick, I love Spielberg and I collected respect to Osment since I watched 6th Sense. So after A.I. I recherched for Osment movies and found filmographies and so on (yes, shoulda done earlier). And then, I found out that Pay It Forward runs on TV one day later. Before my recherche I didn't know that Pay It Forward exists anyhow, so I had luck anyway.

Hunt and Spacey were well acting as considered, but to be honest I don't know too much to have a right to critic them.

Angie Dickinson was well casted, my greatest remember of her acting is in Wild Palms, yes. I know many films but that's what I have in mind when I see her or listen her name.

Bon Jovi, hmm. Really nothing to say.

This is my first post here and I'm sorry but I did not fully understand what a sp.oiler seems to be and so I don't know if I got a must to type this word in here. This board seems to be moderated so the reviewer of the this post could send me a short message with a ""clean"" definition of s.po.iler in here, thanks.

So a knife stab at that kind seen in that movie seems not to be a must of death. I am neither a medicine nor a cynic but that boy had a good chance to survive that ""little poke"". The doctor was the wrong one. That was cynic, okay.

Not finished finding out if I'm confused, I rate 8/10.",
6 January 2015,Value of paying forward,"Now I know... I could perceived things, things happened to me long time ago, happens now and maybe will happen tomorrow. The reason... We all are here, living for not to pay back what we are given, but to pay forward How beautiful phrase it is, TO PAY FORWARD Special thanks for Catherine Ryan Hyde, A writer of the book/movie ""Pay It Forward"" We all think about to pay back. If our parents bring us up, we care them because they had done for us before. It is wrong. They do for use, but we don't pay back, we pay forward to our kids. Also we care our parents not because to pay back something, because we love them. Only reason. This film taught me a lot of things which were unclear, but actually they were clear, but I was blind. That's what I learned.

29 September 2004,A morally beautiful tale,"Pay It Forward provides a well-acted deconstruction of modern society. Living in a world that often destroys hope with mass media approaching life from a depressing and negative stance, the naivety and hope that are portrayed leaves a viewer feeling warm and fuzzy and it is hard to avoid having a tear well in the eye. A young boy is used to show what is wrong with the world by overcoming his low socio-economic obstacles to touch the lives of many. At times corny and often pathetic on the surface, the superb acting leaves the viewer in no doubt of the power of belief and makes you wonder how simple it is to manipulate, whether for good or bad, the majority of society. A thoroughly enjoyable movie that I would rate as one of my favourites. Four and a half out of Five.

26 November 2004,"One of the best ""Feel Good"" movies ever!","I love this movie. Its mostly a love story but with such a good message for young and old. Haley Joel has a rough relationship with his alcoholic mother who he loves so very much but wants desperately to help her. Until a new teacher in his 7th grade class comes up with a class assigniment that just might somehow give Haley Joel an idea on how to help his mom and so many other people unexpectedly. Kevin Spacey who plays the teacher does an excellent job of portraying one of those teachers you wished you always had. I would recommend it to anyone. All though there is one love scene. But for anyone over the age of 12 would be OK. I loved all the actors in this movie. Haley Joel Osmond shines in this film. I can watch this movie over and over again.

15 November 2013,Below Average,"It's hard to know where to start to review this film, whether it be the weak characters, big name actors that should know better or the flimsy story which is meant to leave us feeling motivated to go out and do good.

Helen Hunt is completely unconvincing as a hard up, alcoholic single Mum...she's just too nice, soft and good looking to work in this role.

HJO is almost a carbon copy of himself from the Sixth Sense (a far superior film in every aspect).

Kevin Spacey is just not gritty enough within his role of HJO's teacher.

Las Vegas seems a very strange place for this to be set also - this is never really explained or touched on. It could've been set anywhere really and it wouldn't improve matters.

The whole idea that doing something good for 3 people which needs to be something difficult for yourself is a good enough concept however, human nature is generally too selfish to deal with this. The fact that someone does something good for you, you then have to ""pay this forward"" to 3 other people will leave a lot questioning whether you would bother if the good thing has already happened to you - there is no concept that it will be reversed if you don't do anything good for anyone else.

For me, there was just not enough in the story to buy into the concept. Inherently, if you have to tell people to be nice to others and only then when someone is nice to you in the first place, there really is no hope for us all, surely...?

In conclusion, if I can stop 3 people watching this film, I have certainly paid it forward.",4

29 July 2006,Best Movie I have seen in a long time!,"This movie is beautiful. Maybe a little corny at times, but it doesn't bring the movie down. I would have to say though, this movie is not for the faint-hearted. I watched Pay it Forward yesterday, and it is a really emotional movie, and not just the ending. Throughout the whole movie, I had tears in my eyes. I would not recommend this movie to people who can't handle some sappiness. Haley was wonderful in Pay It Forward, he has so much talent, he played the role perfectly. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt fit really well in their characters, specially Helen Hunt. It is totally worth to rent or buy this movie. You might be let down by the ending, I certainly was, but it's best not to have a Fairy-tail happy ending. Watch this movie and you will see what an unmistakeably good movie this is.

23 February 2016,A moving story,"There are countless words that can be used to describe the 2000 American drama, Pay It Forward. I will say, this film is definitely a drama for a reason. The main storyline is one that is engaging and will tug on your emotions around every turn. However, while watching, it is far too easy to become lost in the midst of the plot. Based on the novel by Catherine Ryan Hyde, the film, although perplexing at times, comes to life thanks to well played roles by a very gifted cast.

""Pay It Forward"" is the name of an idea originated by a young 11-year-old, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment). It is Trevor's first day of seventh grade and his intimidating social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey), gives his class an abnormal and seemingly impossible yearlong assignment: Think of an idea to change our world, and put it into action. Trevor lives in Los Vegas with his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt). His mother is a is a relapsing alcoholic trying to hold down two jobs to support her son. His once abusive father (Jon Bon Jovi) is mostly absent from their life with the exception of a few unannounced visits.

Although Trevor's world around him appears nothing but negative, he is the only student that takes Mr. Simonet's assignment to heart. The idea he outlines out on the classroom blackboard is simple, yet substantial. He will do a good deed for three people, each of whom will do a good deed for three others, and so on. The only rule is this good deed must be something the recipient cannot do themselves. Throughout the film we follow Trevor as he completes his kind acts. He helps out a homeless man (James Caviezel) to get back on his feet, attempts to fix his mother up with Mr. Simonet hoping she will get sober, and tries to rescue one of his peers who is frequently pestered by bullies.

If you are looking for a heart-wrenching drama you have found the right movie. Unfortunately, there are moments when the drama is difficult to follow. The narration of Trevor's life is intertwined with scenes that take place months into the future. These side stories follow individuals that are pulled into the ""pay it forward"" movement. Each of the story lines are connected, but the way director Mimi Leder pieced them together almost becomes distracting. On the screen it looks unpolished the way the film cuts between scenes. Sure, the story may wander away at times, but the acting by an award winning cast allows the film come to life and walk back to focus with fantastic character development.

Despite the young age of Haley Joel Osment, his facial expressions and body language skills are equivalent to a much more experienced actor. In the scenes he acts alongside his on screen mother, he develops so much emotion that it actually looks like he made Helen Hunt cry. He is truly outstanding, simply because he can dive into a scene and make it seem like reality. The talent continues to expand beyond Osment. Academy Award winners Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt create a dynamic on screen that enhances even the dullest of scenes. Emotion is shown not only from their mannerisms, but also the special tone in their voices. It is clear that Spacey and Hunt have some experience.

Overall, Pay it Forward is a moving story that will make you smile, laugh and cry. The talented trio of actors shine a light of hope for humanity by telling numerous extraordinary messages. ""Can one person really change the world?"" After watching, I hope your answer to this question is far less surprising than the final scene of this film.",

The plot is simple but could be overly dramatic for most young viewers but for those who have been through life long enough, this film will get a lot of nods and a few tears. Personally, I think, Jerry's line ""do me a favour and save my life"" had more impact than Eugene's revelation about his past. The make-up artist did a fine job of transforming Arlene's character from a trashy and a tired mother coping with her problems into a person who is on her way to picking herself up. As for the content, changing the world doesn't have to start in a big way - start from yourself and work outwards. The key is having the heart to at least try. Second is to put it into action. Then watch! Like Eugene said ""...grade the effort and not the result"". Of course it would really be nice if you get something positive, if not, try again!

5 January 2006,We loved this movie~!,"I was at first hesitant at watching this movie but loving Helen Hunt, and Haley Joel Osment I couldn't resist watching at least one time.

I watched it and loved it. It didn't end like i thought but sometimes that makes a movie more interesting.

It was more a real life movie than lots, not a lot of fiction included. I am planning on buying the DVD I liked it so much.

I would recommended it to others (as i have).

Helen Hunt played a wonderful part in this also.

I was surprised that Jon Bon Jovi could act as well as sing, not that i thought his part was all that but it added to the story line well.",9
31 January 2006,best ever,"In a world where hope is fading and our young people filled with self absorption...this movie breaks open hearts which have become hardened..by life on life's terms.

I watched this movie with my stepfather... His mother committed suicide..having lived her life filled with hopeless negativity... I believe that change starts within each human being...and the theme of this movie was right on the mark...

How many people suffer in silence, taking their bitterness out on themselves with self destructive behavior...and sending it outward in a shower of rage toward others?? I was one of them....

The unconditional love which Helen's character portrays toward her alcoholic mother..is so key. Key to release..freedom from the pain...of not having her expectations met...Who does? Don't we always want MORE? Don't we think we are ENTITLED? It is only in self forgetting that one finds...and of course I did not write that one...you have St. Francis to thank for that.....

Call me a sap...I do not care..for I care to believe that there are those left who will not give in...to the insanity of hopelessness and despair...those people who still believe in love at first sight...and love that has nothing at all to do with materialism...physical beauty...age, creed, or any other shallow attraction....

This movie changed the way I think...and to me...that merits more than a few tears on a Monday evening.....

It talks about HOPE

It speaks of Love

and it captured my Heart and makes me want to Pay it Forward.....",10
7 February 2006,Interesting film taking different perspective - Highly recommended.,"I really was quite shocked by the movie at first, as the story line and plot jumped around the place and things didn't make a great deal of sense! However, as the movie progressed I found myself enthralled to the film and began emphasizing with the characters, even though it may have been hard to for the characters in this film. I didn't quite under stand the setting aside from the fact that it was in Las Vegas and the clip of footage at the beginning of the film was I felt slightly unrelated to how the end worked out - or at least I didn't understand it. It does deserve the 9/10 rating that I have given it however for solely the interest and different perspective it provided the viewer.

Highly recommended.

15 March 2006,Pay it forward,"This movie is AMAZING..! Its all about helping others instead of only thinking of themselves. Trevor is a very mature boy for his age, and he finds out a way how to help other people. His heart is made of gold. This film is so beautiful and sad that it takes your breath away. How can a person be so good, when there is so many evil people in the world. Trevor shows that you can make a difference by helping people. You don't have to by them a house or something, but just give them a helping hand. Watchs this movie and you will sit with a tear in your eye and love in your heart. Goodness exist, you just have to give a little to get something back.

26 March 2006,Not as good as it seems at first glance,"Pay It Forward is a stimulating but ultimately disappointing film. It is disappointing for several reasons. 1. The plot is full of unlikely coincidences and spoils the credibility of the film. It is possible and perhaps likely for abused people to meet and love each other but by so heavily accenting this and placing the emphasis on it at crucial moments of the plot the director misses the opportunity to deepen less obvious moments. 2. The acting is inconsistent. Some scenes are explored fully enough for the actor to GRADUALLY convince the audience of the emotion s/he is trying to convey. Other scenes are so hurried and so overdrawn that the actor must distort the exact feeling s/he is trying to convey. 3. The subplots are too many and too coincidental. 4. Some of the emotion in the film is worthy of exploration. Other emotions are just cheap shots. The film can be riveting but it is not riveting for what it does but for what the reader imagines it could do if it had been better--that is, more honestly, made. Finally, it's a great disappointment. Avoid it. There are enough such disappointments in life. We don't need more in art!
