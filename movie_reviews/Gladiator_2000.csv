6 August 2014,They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
11 October 2020,"As a matter of fact, Maximus, I AM entertained.","Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.

I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.

It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that's what a good gladiator match should be.

6 April 2021,One of the best films ever,"There are so many iconic lines and quips in this film, too many to count

It was easily the best film of the start of the millennium.

""on my mark, unleash hell!""

""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.""

12 March 2022,Spellbinding.,"One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.

The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.

I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.

One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10.",10
24 February 2020,Great,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""

21 August 2020,"20 Years On, It Still Rewards And Grips","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the clich√©'s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.

15 May 2009,"Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery!","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

1 November 2006,A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.

Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""

The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.

Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.",8
18 February 2019,Why don't they make films like this anymore,"Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film

17 February 2021,Timeless. A modern day classic. Epitome of an epic. An all-time great.,"""Are you not entertained?!?!""

One of the most perfect movies ever made. The pacing, the characterization & development. Hans Zimmer's score. John Mathieson's cinematography. Career-making acting from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, & Djimon Hounsou. Everything is on point.

This movie is an integral part of Ridley Scott's holy trinity, along with Blade Runner & Alien. Endlessly rewatchable. Endlessly quotable. An epic tragedy on the level of Shakespeare & Ancient Greece.

This movie will be just as popular a hundred years from now, and no movie about Ancient Rome will have topped it.

19 February 2001,Edge of Your Seat Fun!,"Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.

The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.

Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.

Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!",10

6 March 2002,Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.,"I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.

Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.",

12 September 2005,Can't be missed!,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score ¬ñ it is truly a ""complete"" movie.

I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.

Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future...

The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant ¬ñ and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.

""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it ¬ñ I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!",10
2 May 2000,Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out,"The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".

Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".

And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.

The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.

Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.",
6 June 2000,Breathtaking!,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!",10
3 May 2000,"A nail biting, intense modern epic!","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.

Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.

Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.

Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.

But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.

Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!",10
4 October 2020,The Glory that was Rome was of another day,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8
7 September 2002,One of the Greatest Movies Ever,"I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out. People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality. The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history. He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen. The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life. If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.

30 May 2002,There are great films and then there is GLADIATOR,"It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few ""reviews"" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as ""horrible movie,"" ""no interesting characters,"" ""bad acting"" and my personal favorite, ""crappy special effects,"" is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.

GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't ""think"" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.

Crappy special effects huh? Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The ""crowds"" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and ""matted"" together - you want to tell me it ""looked"" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the ""Chariot Race"" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.

A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.",
22 February 2012,"Impressive epic movie with strong casting , rousing sets , and overwhelming combats","Breathtaking Sword and Sandals plenty of swordplay , perfect cast ,lively pacing , massed action ,dastardly plots and many other things . The late second century : the Roman army is fighting Germania where takes place a bloody carnage . Troops are commanded by general Maximus (Russell Crowe). Ailing Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) would like his confident and favorite to take over empire , but the events go wrong . Mean heir Comodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) vices arise from poor parental care as he takes power. When the Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son , the insecure Commodus feels powerful . Having ensured father dies in his arms , the new emperor exerts his killer fury . Maximus , then comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge .He won't swear loyalty and gets a chance to redeem himself .Father of a murdered son , husband to a murdered wife and I shall have my revenge in this life or the next .

This bloody good movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills ,fundamental emotions , fortright spectacle ,fierce combats including scud catapults , and is pretty entertaining . The film results to be a special remake to ¬®Fall of Roman Empire¬® directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¬®Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven¬® films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.

The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film ¬®Someone to watch over me¬® and others as ¬®Blade runner¬®, ¬®Black rain¬® , ¬®Legend¬® in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality ,the historical genre , as ¬®Robin Hood¬® , ¬®Kingdom of heaven¬® , ¬®Duelists¬® and ¬®Black Hawk down¬® . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers",8

15 February 2021,Maximus Decimus Meridius,"One of the really great film achievements that has what every film should have, and that is the character that makes the film worth watching.

In this case, it's a character you just have to love, an honest and honorable soldier doing his duty and who actually just wants to go home. Instead of going home, circumstance directs him on a path of revenge and bloody battles.

The cast is good and Joaquin Phoenix is great as Commodus, one of the best villains on the movie screen ever. Insidious and sinister, he is the perfect opposite of Maximus, and that is the backbone of this truly visually impressive cinematic piece.

The cinematography is excellent, the film is a true visual marvel and transports us to some other, ancient times. The battles are spectacular, bloody and brutal, and the battle with the chariots is especially impressive.

The music fit the story perfectly, the soundtrack is brilliant. The music further emphasizes the emotions and makes the film even better.

The film is full of violence, which is brilliantly directed and exciting and evokes the brutality of that time. The characters give us the feel and impression of that time and what is really great is that there is nothing modern in them.

A spectacular and tense cinematic achievement.",10
19 November 2005,Nitpicking is only criticism,"There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.

It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely.

It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.

Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.

Great entertaining movie nonetheless.",9

4 June 2000,Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .,"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.

The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.

I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.

Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.

The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming. The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome. In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.

The script itself is very good. Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with. (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)

It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.",10
16 December 2020,A classic diamond in the rough,"Despite its predecessors, Gladiator has managed to hold its own against many box office hits of today. Russel Crowe acting his heart out in one of the most well cast and filmed epics of a generation.

21 July 2020,"Ridley Scott's Ancient Revenge Fantasy is a Burner, Through and Through","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.

It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch. An exceptionally powerful production, damn near perfect in all respects.",10

There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10

9 July 2023,An Epic of Our Time,"In an age where CGI often overshadows storytelling, Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a breath of fresh cinematic air. This historical epic, set in a tumultuous era of the Roman Empire, is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing an amalgamation of riveting performances, stunning visuals, and a score that stirs the soul.

At the heart of Gladiator is Maximus Decimus Meridius, played with steely determination and compelling vulnerability by Russell Crowe. Crowe's performance is a spectacular tour de force, embodying a man whose honor, family, and freedom are taken from him. The depth of his character arc - from respected Roman general to enslaved gladiator, from broken man to symbol of hope - is beautifully depicted, earning Crowe a well-deserved Oscar.

Opposite Crowe is Joaquin Phoenix as the power-hungry, emotionally unstable Emperor Commodus. Phoenix masterfully portrays a character that we love to hate, providing a worthy adversary for Crowe's Maximus. The scenes between the two are electric, the tension palpable.

Visually, Gladiator is a spectacle to behold. The depiction of ancient Rome, from its grand coliseums to its war-torn battlefields, is rendered with incredible detail and authenticity. The gladiatorial combats are raw and thrilling, capturing the brutality and excitement of the Roman games. Scott doesn't shy away from the violence, but rather uses it to underline the brutality of the era and the courage of those who dared to defy it.

Yet, it is the film's memorable score by Hans Zimmer that elevates Gladiator to an exceptional cinematic experience. From the melancholic ""Now We Are Free"" to the stirring ""Battle,"" Zimmer's soundtrack resonates, amplifying the emotion and gravitas of the narrative.

The screenplay, too, deserves praise. Packed with memorable lines - ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" - it's a script that complements the grandeur of the film's visuals and performances.

Gladiator is more than a movie; it's an experience. A return to the golden age of epic filmmaking, it provides an emotional depth often lacking in blockbuster fare. It's a tale of vengeance and redemption, of the struggle against tyranny, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Two decades on, its impact remains undiminished, solidifying its position as one of the most compelling films of the 21st century.",10
6 January 2008,Pretentious and Mediocre,"Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.

I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.

For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.

The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.

Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.

I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.

General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.

There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.

As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.

As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.

Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.",6
30 August 2021,Still Amazing Twenty Years Later,"Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned. It's beautiful to look at, gorgeous to listen to, expertly directed and edited. I give Gladiator a resounding 9/10.

12 February 2012,Amazing and a bit disappointing.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down.

29 March 2002,Adequate Roman Epic,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.

The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions.

There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.

Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris.

Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.",7

23 October 2001,Predictable Spectacle,"I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.",7
20 June 2020,Gladiator,"What really touched me was not its luxurious production level, exquisite historical props, simple costume design, textured photography, or a strong sense of war scene. What really touched me was the moment when he touched the wheat waves dancing with the wind, looked at the blue gray sky in the distance, and slowly set foot on the way home under the eyes of his wife and children. For me, those excellent productions are only the surface, and the scene of the warrior coming home is the real soul of the film.

8 June 2001,Thank you Ridley Scott.,"Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it? While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year. In any other year, not containing a film named ¬ëCast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.

Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction. To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.

Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming). Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful. This is a far different epic than ¬ëAlien', and far better than ¬ëHannibal'.

Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in ¬ëThe Quick and the Dead' and the awful ¬ëVirtuosity'.

Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus. Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in ¬ëTrainspotting', ¬ëLittle Voice' and ¬ëStar Wars: Episode I'. Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.

As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus. Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.

The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment. After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie. However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family.

Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review). I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.",8
22 October 2006,Victory of production over a lousy script,"There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.

For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.

Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.

Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.

On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.

But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.

The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.

So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.",7
14 May 2000,Film as Colosseum,"Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.

Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.

So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.

Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.",

The crime is that it didn't get the other 7 it was nominated for.

20 April 2010,The ending destroyed it for me,"As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.

For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.

What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.

This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.",1
7 May 2000,The Illusionist and the Ventriloquist,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",

7 June 2001,"Worst ""historical"" film ever","If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.

Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.

Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations?

Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.

Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).

And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III.",3
25 July 2023,The best of its genre,"""Gladiator"" explores themes of honor, loyalty, revenge, and the price of power. It delves into the complex characters and their struggles, examining their choices and the consequences they face.

The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the sweeping landscapes and epic scale of the Roman Empire. The film's dark and earthy color palette adds to its gritty and immersive atmosphere.

Ridley Scott captures the grandeur and brutality of ancient Rome, immersing the audience in the world of gladiatorial combat and political intrigue. The battle scenes are intense and visually striking, and Scott's attention to detail in recreating historical settings adds to the film's authenticity.

Russell Crowe delivers a powerhouse performance as Maximus, earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Crowe portrays the character's strength, determination, and inner turmoil with an authenticity that makes Maximus a truly compelling and memorable protagonist.

Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is equally brilliant. He brings a sense of cruelty and vulnerability to the character, creating a captivating and formidable antagonist.",10
20 August 2020,One of the best BC era films,"This film is probably one of the closest representations of the era its based on we will ever get to see.

5 October 2021,Visually Captivating Ancient Rome,"Gladiator is an epic film in its reach and grandeur. It shoots for the stars and occasionally reaches, but the weak script prevents it from it's aspirations of greatness. Crowe's performance received the lion's share of attention but for me it's Phoenix performance that really drives this film. The cinematography, costumes, direction, and score are all excellent and raise the film to a thoroughly entertaining experience.

22 November 2010,Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive,"Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).

Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.

Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.",3
24 March 2021,My favorite movie of all time !!,"I have watched this movie well over 10 times !! It's the legend of the movie industry. There was some movies that came close to this one, but never enjoyed one more than Gladiator. As soon as the movie starts, it takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions, suspense and excitement. The story is just beautiful and the whole setting is perfect. Russell Crowe gives his absolute best and you can see that clearly. This is an example of how a movie should be, Gladiator is a masterpiece.

30 August 2020,Gladiator,"The general had distinguished himself in battle, had a harmonious family, and wished to retire. The old king was very fond of the general, and hoped that when he came home he would come back and take the throne. But the prince was so unhappy with this arrangement that he killed the old king and the general's family. The general was nearly killed.

After the general escaped, he finally went home, but it was too late. Seeing the horror at home, the general began to wander. Later caught by traffickers and sold into slavery.

Later, the general became a gladiator, after finding confidence, began the road of revenge. . Finally, before he dies, he takes his revenge.

18 May 2000,A class act!!,"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one. This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations. It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.

The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them). I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation. His physical performance is as good as his mental one.

The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe. In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart. I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was. If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.

Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.

A must see, five stars out of five.",7
27 April 2014,You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life,"You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life:

First time - in puberty for the special effects and epic battles. Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.

Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.

Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?

I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it.",10
16 May 2000,Is Crowe the 'next action hero?',"Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: ¬ëStrength and Honour.'

The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.

Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.

It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can ¬ëdo evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.

As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.

The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.

Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!

All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.",
27 April 2018,Maximus Excitus Entertainius.,"In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.

From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.

If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.",9
2 February 2001,What do you expect?,"Gladiator is one of those movies that tries to present a splendid old story with today standards of film making so younger persons of our time could be impressed by that too. well, what do you expect? Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching. I claim that I bought the tape of the movie, because I felt that my library needed it.

And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
4 August 2000,"Top 250? Not even top 1000, sorry","How has Ridley Scott pulled the veil over everyone's eyes? The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail. The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level. If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names. Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire. I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man."" What utter nonsense! Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic? The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus."" And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him? The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.",5
9 August 2021,Joaquin Phoenix is one of the greatest actors of our time.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing).

13 December 2004,Didn't deserve the Oscar...Doesn't deserve Top 250.,"There's really nothing spectacular about ""Gladiator"". The acting is stiff because of the boring and sometimes non-sensible script. Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.

4 June 2001,who cares about historical inaccuracy?,"GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.",9
7 January 2021,"A really superb, exciting and emotional film.","Sit down with the person you love and let yourself be smothered with one of the greatest films and music scores...

At the end of the film I guarantee you will appreciate being loved and having somebody to love - Oliver Reed is outstanding....

By the way this film when I originally saw it all those years ago holds the record for the latest film I have ever seen at the flicks - 1.50am I left the Cinema - late but worth every emotional minute....

26 August 2006,"Swords, sandals, battlefields and an amazingly poignant struggle at its core ¬ñ it has all you could ask for in an epic Roman saga, plus well-placed flair and fury.","""They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""

Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields √° la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.

Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal ¬ñ a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?

So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.

These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood.

The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.

A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose ¬ñ well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus.

17 December 2000,Ridley Scott's lame take on a WWF bout,"The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.

Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.

Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).

In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.

For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.

Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.

The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.

When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.",1
21 September 2020,Proof a perfect film is not flawless,"While Gladiator is traditional (if not basic) in its overall plot, the characters and performances bring the trophy home in this film. Beautifully shot, with just the right amount of violence and emotion, it's a good technical film as well. Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.

Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character. His creepy nature just rubs it all in.

This was the first film I saw (when it came out) that I then knew of Phoenix's skills and potential. He's been a favorite ever since.

9 January 2013,a perfect waste of celluloid,"Not sure were to start. A great director a very fine cast. A pointless movie. It starts with again a PotC soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted. Also watch Titus and be really stunned by acting soundtrack and story.

21 June 2000,Such a Mixed Bag,"I absolutely love Ridley Scott. ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films. ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.

Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star. Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here. He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.

My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails. It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart."" He was fighting for freedom and justice. Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire. Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes. Yes, we get the point. He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife. Move on already!

Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular. The Colliseum is an impressive sight. The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart. And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.

In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.",5

18 June 2006,"Majestic production that won 2000s-audience; Fabulous Roman epic that echoes in film history as ""masterpiece""","They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.

Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.

First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.

It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.

CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.

Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.

And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...

GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10!

They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?",10
28 November 2005,"uninspiring story and characters, not saved by good cinematography","The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was shot well with careful planning in costume and excellent scenery. I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.

'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference. It is too bad because I had some high expectations for this film and the genre.

18 July 2007,Costumes and Melodrama,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap.

1 November 2005,Gladiator is better than...,"Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.

25 February 2001,Another big budget variation on a well-worn theme,"Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery. However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions. And, it is not a new plot. It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.

22 January 2001,"Too Long, Overrated & Close To Awful","""Gladiator"" was too long which ensured it to be quite often very boring. What really bothers me is how overrated ""Gladiator"" is, upholding the tradition of all the modern day epic's. The simple minds of so many today fail to realize how uninspiring this movie was. It stuns me how audiences believe a movie is good when it's running time exceeds 150 minutes.

""Gladiator"" wasn't awful, however it got very close.

10 March 2005,Oscar for Best Picture? Come on!,"Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.

Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.

As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.

The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.

I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.",
30 May 2000,Entertaining but silly...,"Okay, it was entertaining... okay, Russell Crowe does know how to act and does have ""le physique du role"" to be the perfect gladiator... okay, both Richard Harris and Oliver Reed do shine in their roles... but how can so many people do not notice the flaws in this movie?

The screenplay? Almost non existent... The CGI effects? Good, but you can spot the fake in some of them even if you're almost blind... And what about all the historical mistakes? Commodus signing (with a pen!!!!) some documents (contracts?) apparently written on paper (but this is an old clich√©)... again, a paper sheet advertising the gladiator fight (has Ridley Scott or his historical consultant any idea about how much did papyrus cost???) Let's not talk about the art direction and set decoration... is it really enough to fill any room with pillars and marble busts and statues to give a ""Roman look"" to a period picture? And was the Russell Crowe character so strong to walk around dressed as for a battle even in scenes where it was not required?... I could go on even longer, but let's stop here... I really expected an improvement over the movies of Hollywood's golden age, and it's sad to see that while computer graphics can do wonders, screenwriters and directors tend not to do it anymore...

Where's the spirit of the man who gave us ""The Duelists"", ""Alien"" or ""Thelma & Louise""? Will it resurface in ""Hannibal""?... Let's hope so...",5

3 June 2001,"Overhyped movie, entertaining but mostly fiction","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.

Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.

It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.

The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.

The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.

I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.

Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.",5
27 August 2000,"Riotously campy success in the ""guilty pleasure"" genre, but much too long due to pretense of being some kind of intellectual high tragedy.","Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke.

The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.

A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.",5

26 June 2000,I Come to Bury ...,"I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did. My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister. But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie. In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.

GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by Ridley Scott; no two ways about it. What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through? What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie? What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it? The ineptitude goes on and on. The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes. High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness. It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.' And lets talk about this cinematography. Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes! Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role. Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting. ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action. Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format. Expect to be more confused than entertained.

There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR. The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent. Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially, Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.",5
9 March 2021,"""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?""","I have been waiting for years to watch this movie. My dad never let me because it was rated r and I wasn't old enough. i finally turned 15 and he let me watch it. Very very good movie. If only my dad let me watch it unedited with all the violence it probably would be even better. I keep telling my dad I can handle the violence and I am not a scared little boy, and he edited out like all of the bloody fighting. And what is crazy is that we watched The Patriot (2000) and he edited like nothing. We saw almost everything from that movie. Ive heard that movie was more violent than this one. Whatever. I still loved it even though almost all of the violence was cut out from my dad. The plot was really good and the quotes are really memorable. Can't wait till im older and I leave my dads house and watch this with all the violence. But till then i will have to say this was a great movie even though it would probably be better with the violence

2 February 2021,Beautiful film!,"'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.

Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.

Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.

Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.",8
1 November 2021,Masterclass - Legendary,"I love this movie. I've watched it at least 10 times and still get goosebumps and get emotional as a man. A must see for everyone once in a year. This movie should get 10x10.

27 March 2019,A Masterpiece Of Polished Pulp Cinema,"GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.

And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).

I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.

3 June 2001,What's the big whoop?,"Well, that was a big old damp squib. The budget and the decent cast

ensure that Gladiator is a competent film, but its by no means a good

one.

Sure, there are some genuinely engaging fight sequences, but that's

_all_ Gladiator has going for it. And to be brutally frank, they're

not all that great technically. Crowe gives it his best shot, but his

opponents have to do a lot of incompetent poses to allow him to chop

them up, and for me that ruins any actual dramatic effect that the

action sequences might have had.

The extended conversations are just boring. The characters are well

acted, but are sketchy and uninvolving, and I just can't bring myself

to care about any of them. And sure, Maximus has a sad story, but so

would all of his fellow gladiators, yet we don't get to hear them

whining. Rank apparently does have its priveleges even in the slave

pits.

Oliver Reed stands out by actually making his character vaguely

intersting, but that's the balanced by the insipid Connie Neilson

who's utterly mundane and can't decide what accept she's trying to

affect.

Gladiator is a waste of budget, time and talent. It's a great

shame that it was such a success, because it will just encourage more

studios to throw money at similar follies on the basis that no film

with a budget in excess of 100 million dollars US has ever lost money.",1
8 August 2020,Epic,"This film is the definition of epic. It follows the journey of one man and is quite tight with no detours or distractions. This journey is full of emotion, pain and action and the film portrays this all quite wonderfully.

26 March 2005,A Modern Epic,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

14 March 2021,Simply amazing...,"""Gladiator"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man seeks revenge from the Roman emperor who set the murder of his family and tried to kill him too. He has to find a way to approach the emperor and be ready to take his revenge.

I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot that kept me in tense through its whole duration and the direction which was made by Ridley Scott was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Russell Crowe who played as Maximus was iconic and I believe that he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joaquin Phoenix's who played as Commodus, Richard Harris' who played as Marcus Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou's who played as Juba. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Gladiator"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed by it.

19 August 2005,don't deserve the credit it got.,"When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so.

The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.

Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.

One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.",5
28 May 2001,White Elephant,"In the 1960s, Steve Reeves would have killed John Drew Barrymore after 80 minutes (the necessary time to tell such an inane story), and ""The End"" (""Fine"" is more appropriate) would have appeared on the screen, as Reeves kissed Myl√®ne Demongeot, Chelo Alonso or Scilla Gabel in the hereafter. The production would have cost 1/200 of the ""Gladiator"" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this ""white elephant"". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.

22 August 2022,Brutal Masterpiece with Something to Say,"This is a movie that I originally saw in the theater with my mother and sister when it came out. I believe this would have put Russell Crowe on my radar along with Joaquin Phoenix. That first time seeing this, I loved it. It is one that I've seen since then, but it had been a while. Jaime and I watched this with her parents as well while we were visiting them. This is on our Internet Movie Database poster as well.

We follow Maximus (Crowe) as they're fighting the barbarian tribes of Germania. The emperor is Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). He is fond of Maximus and much of this is the time that has been spent on the battlefield. Maximus is a great general. They score a victory and this brings Marcus' children to celebrate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and Commodus (Phoenix). Marcus scolds his son and this enrages him, causing him to kill the emperor. Without the knowledge of what happened, Commodus has Maximus branded a traitor and they try to kill him.

There are events that happen that land Maximus a slave and owned by Proximo (Oliver Reed). He bought him to compete as a gladiator. Proximo can see the promise that Maximus has. It also leads him back to Rome, known as the Spaniard. Commodus flirts with becoming a dictator and those in the senate do not want that. Corruption is starting in Rome and Maximus could be a tool to fix it.

Now while writing this, I did realize something. I didn't know that Marcus and Commodus are real people. I didn't look deeper to see if the events that happened here or real or not, because this feels like it is borrowing from Spartacus. If there is truth here or not, I love this story. We have a revenge story at its core. I'm fascinated by world history where this is set. The gladiator battles are something else that are fascinating to me. There is an interesting commentary here on government corruption that is social relevant as well. You could say that the United States is flirting with this now on both sides. As someone who loves commentary, you have me on board.

If you don't care about subtext, we still have good performances. It is funny seeing a man from New Zealand play a Spaniard, but Crowe is good. He has charisma for this role, especially to entertain the audiences. Phoenix is a great villain. Nielsen is good along with Spencer Treat Clark as her son. I also liked seeing Djimon Hounsou as another slave and even Tommy Flanagan. We also get a great cast of older actors here with smaller roles like Reed, Harris, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Tomas Arana and David Hemmings. Along with the casting, I love the battle scenes. This movie goes brutal with the effects, which I appreciate. There is a gritty and dirty feel to the fighting that feels real. This is a film that holds up after multiple watches in my opinion and I can see why it is sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. Plus, Ridley Scott could direct the heck out of a movie.

My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9
12 April 2023,Mainly driven by incredible performances,"Since the film's first theatrical release, this has been bombarded by some ""experts"" accusing the creators of fabrications and falsifications of history. Those people have been pointing out and have been quite vocal about all the historical inaccuracies that are presnet in the writing.

Now, I am neither a history buff nor do I deem myself knowledgeable enough to pass any sort of comments on this subject; however, I came here for my piece of entertainment, and I got plenty of it, and that is all that matters to me in the end.

The movie has some incredible performances, a masterfully composed score, and a narrative that too seems to leave a lasting impact by the time it finally wishes to draw down the curtains. These things were more than enough to make me appreciate Mr. Scott's admirable attempts and I did adore what he had attained.

2 December 2021,Commodus,"This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.

Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!

After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie. It's good, great even but it never quite hit me right. I never mind watching it, but also never really feel like seeking it out. This just happened to be on and I didn't change the channel or stream and wound up watching it and you know what? It's great for that, because it's a good watch.",7
13 November 2007,This Has No Passion,"This film is just about one mans jealousy. One man. Sparticus was all.

Men and women. This film has no vision. Just another action film, good for football fans, not for philosophers.

What good does the film do except fulfill an expectation of murder?

Whereas Sparitius fulfilled every man and woman's longing for freedom. Freedom! This picture is no more than a large B film. No emotional longing, no trace of true struggle, and no element of love.

Just men bashing up men - again.

Whereas Sparticus had a reason other then mere jealousy, other than mere spiteful self interest, and other than mens measure of each other.

IT HAD LOVE.",5
20 January 2002,What a sad waste,"It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clich√©d, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.

10 January 2010,Rambo of Rome,"As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword & Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.

The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.

The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago.

To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.

In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form. Give me a vintage Italian Sword & Sandal flick, like THE REBEL GLADIATORS, before this inert Hollywood production.",3
17 April 2022,"What Is Rome, Well Here It Is!","Gladiator

A very memorable sword and sandal movie, Russel Crowe was at his best, the music was unbelievable as were the staged spectacles.

If you wanted to make a movie about Rome and the mob this delivered in spades. The two things that made this movie, the incredible score and the fabulous cinematography it was deeply memorable and rarely repeated since.

Russell was at his best, brooding masculinity, the cool and statuesque beauty of Connie Nielsen and the method acting of Joaquin Phoenix was mesmeric. I really thought Oliver Reed gave one of his best ever performances.

I'm giving this a 10 outta 10 meaning this is how you make a movie.",10
6 June 2000,The most non dedesrving over hyped dreck I have seen in ages,"Give me a break....how can people be going on and on about what a wonderful flick this is when it is clearly not. Yes...the openeing battle sequences were splendid....instead of the spanking clean handsome Roman soldiers we are used to seeing in such films, we saw tired, dirty warriors fighting in the mud, slashing their way to victory in what seemed like a realistic situations...and Richard Harris was great and yada yada..BUT... NOTE....PLOT POINTS...DANGER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.. first of all..the pathetic digital gigantic snow flakes...none of which ever landed on anyone or anything or ever melted, and the MTV editing of the battle...so fast that you really could not see anything at all. The digital effects throughout the movie were transparently phoney....at one point they show the coliseum and birds fly by....phoney pathetic birds..and they are so proud of their birds that they reappear two more times at least. Yes...there are some fun moments in the film, but they are overshadowed by poor digital moments and a terrible story...and just to end things on a sad, sad note...if you see the movie again..PLOT POINTS..DANGER!!!..make sure you notice that when poor old Maximus is lying dead on the coliseum floor, someone has nicely put his head on a sand pillow...I guess he really does demand ""star"" treatment!",5
9 August 2023,A sword-and-sandal film of classical proportions,"A sword-and-sandal film of very much classical proportions about power, deceit and tyrannical rule, and how one hero of almost superhuman abilities and goodness rises up against it all and triumphs on behalf of the people. Ridley Scott directs with a command and grandeur befitting a film of this scale, and Russell Crowe in the title role carries the film with a confidence bordering on arrogance reminiscent of Richard Burton in Cleopatra (and with the brilliant Joaquin Phoenix mirroring Roddy McDowall in the same movie). Crowe is oozing of old-fashioned masculinity and star-power, something which in no small part contributes to the film's timeless effect. The action sequences have all the underdoggish, stick-it-to-the-man feel you could ever want.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7
31 August 2000,what a difference 22 years makes,"I first watched this movie 22 years ago, and only just now have I given it another viewing. Wow. It's the same movie so I guess I'm just not the same person. Perhaps I was so enthusiastic at the time because I was happy to see Hollywood make a ""historical"" (more on that later) epic rather than another slasher or car chase fest.

Watching it now I was comparing it with the great sword & sandal flicks of the 50's - Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Egyptian, et.al. This effort doesn't come anywhere close. Maybe part of it is that the computer effects simply don't compare with real imagery.

As far as historical accuracy, excuse me, but WHAT historical accuracy? Many viewers have pointed out the egregious errors and outright falsities perpetrated here. Yes, I know it's a film, not a documentary, but there is a point at which falsity becomes so egregious it disqualifies the movie, and this flick passes that point.

The death scene between Marcus Aurelius and Commodus - aside from the fact that there is zero evidence Commodus killed his father - is simply laughable. ""If only you'd hugged me."" ""I failed as a father."" Such talk is emblematic of the age of Freud and Joyce Brothers, not the age of Cicero and Pliny. Romans at the time would scratch their heads at such talk.

And then we have the execrable music which falls flat compared to the great scores of Miklos Rozsa and Alex North.

So I guess the 22 years since I last watched this dog (I'm seventy-six now) have made me a whole lot fussier.",4
6 February 2014,A summer blockbuster with a novel twist...,"Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.

We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a ""cheap entertainment thrill"" and ""strength and honor"". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more.

Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.

4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.",8
5 August 2000,A special film for one odd reason...,"Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.

That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.

This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.",10
8 June 2015,Repetitious Crap.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",4
20 April 2019,Still a great film,"A great film and easily one of the better his ancient history films. Ridley Scott created a new wave for this genre and rightly so. Russell Crowe is incredible in the lead and provides one of great central performances. The film didn't deserve to be this great, but the filmmaking of Scott and the grand cast create one of the better films of the genre.

15 August 2021,This movie does not hold up.,"I remember seeing this 20 years ago and enjoying it, but there were some things that bothered me about it. First and foremost, I thought the CGI was very cartoonish and took away from the scene. 2nd, everyone know Commodus was as frail as most college age kids in 2021, yet they didn't overthrow him no matter how asinine his orders were. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.

I watched the movie again today 20 years later and yeah, it just doesn't hold up. It seems to me the number one priority was to showcase new technologies that were available back then rather than build a better story.

It's not a horrible movie, it's just a forgettable one.

29 May 2002,I love this movie,"Gladiator is terrific. It is definitely one of my top 5 films of all time. I'm sure everyone knows the plot by now. Russell Crowe is one bad a** MF that kicks major b*tt. Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition. But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.

Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more ""oscar-like"".

FINAL VERDICT: A definite must see. I have this one on tape to watch it over and over again.

30 June 2016,A Decent Action Epic Over-Hyped as Something its Not,"Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.

It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clich√©d as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.

The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.

Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?

Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.

The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.

What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.",5

8 October 2008,""" When Death stares at you and smiles, all you can do is smile back""","If one is ever asked to select a film which truly measures up to action, drama and historically accuracy, "" Gladiator "" is the first on that list. Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****",9
27 December 2022,Timeless,"I rewatched this film for a second time last night, I'm amazed at how brilliantly written and shot this was, especially for a film from 2000. To think that this came out before the LOTR films, much much before GOT/HotD, props to the filmmakers. Great graphics for a movie from > two decades ago.

Hans Zimmer's music - one of the most popular OSTs, ever! Brilliant acting from everybody involved, I felt that Joaquin Phoenix missed out on the Oscar (although I have no recollection of who won the best supporting actor from 2001.)

No wonder this film had 12 nominations and 5 wins, most that year by any film. God knows how many other awards it won, imdb says 60 wins out of 106 nominations, that's a pretty decent win %

The ""Has anybody here served in the army?"" scene and ""Maximus chants"" have fandoms of their own.

This film has now become timeless.",9

19 March 2021,Good movie even though it's not historically accurate,"This is a good movie based on the Roman empire era. I thought the plot was good and kept me intrigued during the long running time. I thought the action scenes were great and it was interesting to watch action without the use of guns or explosions. I like watching watching these types of movies that are based about the past and show you how people used to live. One slight negative about the movie is that it's not entirely historically accurate which is a bit disappointing as some of the characters really did exist, but it doesn't take away the fact that it is a good movie.

9 June 2006,A film that opens the floodgates to what?,"'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.

'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.

'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA?

The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.",1
23 January 2002,Uglier than any pessimist could expect,"Let's forget ""Gladiator"" won the Oscar for the best film: even worse things may happen. As a matter of fact, the movie contains uncountable mistakes and flaws on Roman history and ancient life in general. Some examples follow.

The gladiators were almost NEVER killed in the arena. That's clear: they were too important for the show business, and it costed too much money to train a gladiator to have him murdered. Their fights followed strict rules, nothing to do with the absurd slaughters shown in the movie.

A Roman Citizen by no means could be made slave, as it happens to Maximus in the movie. If sentenced by the Emperor, he could be killed by anybody, but neither made slave nor tortured. That's the reason why Saint Paul was be-headed and not crucified. And the fact that Maximus uses his long sword (Romans had no long swords) with two hands in a Samurai-like style is just too ridiculous to deserve comments.

The Roman army in battle followed a scientific strategy, with tight lines of troops protected by their shields, an established sequence of attacks and retreats, and so on. The battle at the beginning of the movie is an over-confused, poorly photographed brawl. The camp of the Roman Legion was a perfect square, with a strong palisade, and the tents of all ranks were neatly divided inside it. Nothing to do with the messy camping in the forest shown in the film.

""Gladiator"" won an Oscar for the best costumes, too. Well, I think that Oakland Raiders fans wear nicer and more realistic costumes. In particular, the armours and weapons in the movie are unbelievably mistaken: most of them first appeared some 800 years later than the epoch of the story.

But let's forget about Roman History, and say that ""Gladiator"" is either fantasy, or science-fiction, or something like that. Nonetheless, it remains a very ugly movie. The story is boring and utterly predictable. For instance, the whole episode of Maximus' attempted escape can be fore-seen almost second by second. Maximus returns home and finds his house wasted and his family destroyed... a strikingly original idea... perhaps already seen in dozens of western movies! By the way, Maximus goes from Germany to southern Spain (say 1500 miles?), pursued, with no food. How long did this pleasant journey last? Two months? And what about the gangrenous wound, later healed by a fellow gladiator? Come on! And the repeated wanna-be-touching oneiric scene with the hand and the wheat is clumsy and far-fetched.

The action scenes are confused and badly filmed. The violence is so excessive to become ridiculous. The script is awful. The cinematography is generally very poor. Large use of close-ups like in a TV-movie, extremely brief choral scenes. Why? Perhaps in order that the viewer doesn't notice the computer tricks? The fight which closes the movie is by far less spectacular than all other arena scenes: I think this is an enormous mistake for an action flick.

Something to save in ""Gladiator""? The bucks it has made.",1
11 October 2005,Nice movie but is this original,"Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...

1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arena

at least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal",7
13 June 2001,Great Story but Far From Historical,"Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"". It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.

Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192. He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).

His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.

His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death. He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.

He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.

Other than the historical problems, the story was great. I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus. It was your basic struggle between good and evil.",
21 January 2005,A Masterpiece,"Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the commander of Rome's armies and preferred choice as the new Emperor of Rome, this is before Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) murders his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) steals the throne for himself and has Maximus's family killed leaving him for dead.

Set on avenging the loss of his family and his much loved and respected Emporer, Maximus fights his way to the Colosseum in hope of confronting his sworn enemy Commodus. An epic tale of power and corruption ensues and its very satisfying to witness, the fight scenes are fantastic and contain enough gore to bring realism without going overboard.

Truly wonderful performances from Crowe Pheonix and Oliver Reed, bring this Ridley Scott masterpiece to life.

Epic story, powerful drama, top movie 10/10",10
14 May 2020,A Masterpiece,"If there is one movie that you want to watch then that would be this movie. This movie is a perfect 10, everything is just at much higher Standard in this movie. Story of Rome and its Gladiator time is just shown on grand scale, that you can see why so many awards has won by this movie including Oscar.

Russell Crowe is absolutely a master at playing any role, but this Oscar winning is I think his best, so as Oscar nominated high grade performance by Joaquin Phoenix.

Heart of this Movie is it's soul touching music. Original scores and songs by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard gives you out of this world experience. Music has been used in places of dialogues, that many scenes in this movie are just told by music only without a dialogue.

You can watch this movie again and again, you will still be mesmerized by this movie each time. This movie is a pure gold, that shouldn't be missed. If anyone has not watched this movie in 20 years since it's launch, should go watch it, Maximus, the gladiator will entertain you and movie's music will enlighten you.",10
30 December 2002,'Gladiator' battles its way to one of the best movies of all time,"****

Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielson.

A Roman general becomes a slave when he is betrayed. His wife and son were brutally murdered by the prince. But when the slave becomes a gladiator, he fights his way to get to the prince.

The battle sequences, in my opinion, were breathtaking. Especially the fight between all the slaves and the other fighters. This movie is quite bloody (That black arrow lady bit the big one), so you better not eat much before you see this.

This film is one of the greatest of all time, and it deserved every award it won.

27 June 2008,Great acting and story but quite dated and formulaic otherwise.,"I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.

The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their ""best before"" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.

Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.

Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).

So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.",7
11 November 2020,"Gladiator: ""Are You Not Entertained?"" - Yes!","Russell Crowe rightly earned an Oscar for his performance in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix played the part of a jealous, cowardly Emperor perfectly.

There are thousands of 'Reviews' on IMDB about Gladiator, so I'd like to add a personal anecdote or two; in the first ten minutes or so there is a final battle between the might of the Roman Army and the ""Huns"" (German Tribes.) This was the Battle of Teutenberg Forest and it was shot in a farmers field, called Bourne Woods - about two miles from where I used to live.

Seems that when the producers approached the UK's Forrestry Commission for permission to (literally) burn down the forest on the land, they were given permission as the forest was due to be uprooted anyway. So the Commission was happy for the movie makers to do the work for them. Amazing.

Oliver Reed (RIP) was someone who used to frequent a local pub, and he would tell tall tales to keep everyone ""entertained"" - his drinking was legendary.

This movie, IMO, paved the way for others to follow: ""sword and sandals"", such as Centurion, The Eagle, etc. and will be difficult if not impossible to beat.

Another Scott helmed movie is The Kingdom of Heaven with Orlando Bloom and Eva Green. If you loved Gladiator, check this one out also.

Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" - entertainment par excellence. 10/10. Easily.",10
26 February 2002,Not only a great movie but a great DVD,"The acting, action sequences and everything make this a great film. Gladtior was one of the best DVD's of the year 2000. The amazing transfer is one of the best on the market. The sound quailty and picture make you feel as if you're in the theater again. The first disc is the feature and the detailed commentary by Ridley Scott. While the second disc is tv spots, trailers , documentary's and my personla favorite delted scenes. The dvd has over thirty mintues of delted scenes. This DVD's gives good character devloepment and has veyr cool montage.

27 April 2004,"""Are you not entertained?!?!"" - Scott & Crowe at the top of their game","GLADIATOR (2000) **** Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou. Extravagant full-fledged sword and sandal epic from filmmaking genius Ridley Scott takes on the scopic tale of a vengeance seeking Spanish general named Maximus (Crowe in a star-making turn) whose disposition from glorified soldier to slave to eponymous athlete in ancient Rome seeks to avenge the slaughter of his beloved family, his good name and ultimately self-redemption for the betrayal and murder of his mentor Marcus Auerelius (a haggard looking Harris) by his petulantly incestuous son Commoudus (hissably evil Phoenix) and dissuade his sister Lucilla (the divine Nielsen) from emotional imprisonment. Lavish set designs, bold visual effects (check out the Colosseum!), dark and stark cinematography by John Mathieson and Pietro Scalia's razor sharp editing particularly in the arena's carnage dripping bouts with effectively cringing moments of unbridled violence (including one bitchin' chariot fight) that honors its predecessors 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus' well. Sadly Reed's swan song but he gives a noteworthy performance as former gladiator turned slave owner who teaches Mad Maximus the finer skills in kicking ass.

26 October 2003,A great revenge movie that is not as worthy as it thinks it is but is still a great movie,"Maximus is the favoured commander of Emperor Aurelius' armies in Germania. He is favoured to the point that the Emperor, sensing his death is near, commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic. Caesar's son discovers this, kills his father and orders Maximus dead. However he survives and, finding his wife and son murdered, is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo. As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.

If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is. At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters. The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film. It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.

Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right. Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film. True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue. Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here. Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role. Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice. Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.

The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws. The music and direction gives it a great feel ¬ñ the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action. Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.",
6 May 2000,"Live-Action R-rated ""Lion King""","Uhhhhgggg! What the Hell was that? All this movie was missing was Russell Crowe on his knees in the middle of his destroyed home shouting at the sky: ""NOOooooooooooooooo!"" a la Charlton Heston in ""Planet of The Apes."" It's kind of a Roman-period-piece-meets-Braveheart-meets-Lion King-meets-any-Van-Damme movie.

Ya got yer costumes-- ya got yer battles -- ya got yer PC circle-of-life thing (complete with circle-of-life soundtrack) -- ya got yer ""ya-killed-my-family!"" revenge thing going on. There's even a bad guy that's only a few thumb-suckles away from being Prince John in Disney's ""Robin Hood."" Oh, and fer the ""adults"" yah got some complicated politics a personal redemption story and unrequited love and stuff. If this explication sounds like a mishmash, it's because that's what this movie is.

Some of the more laughable instances:

1) Germany, Spain, Rome & Morrocco? all less than 1-1.5 days horse-ride from each other.

2) Killer tigers that like to give juicy hero-types a big hug while the hero has time to feel for a good space between their ribs for a death-strike.

3) A bad guy who's about as dumb as a box of rocks. I was lauging out loud with my friend while he was giving his ""busy-busy bee"" speech. This guy gave me a new appreciation for Sting as Fayd Haarkonen in ""Dune.""

4) People who like to put dangerous poisonous cobras on a table for funsies. The snake did a *lot* of hissing, and I knew the foley artists where just *itchin'* to dub a rattle-snake-rattling sound into that scene.

5) Dead-meat slaves who get to massacre the rock group ""Gwar"" not once, but twice in a coliseum.

6) and many more too numerous to mention...

Constant happenstance and hokum punctuated with blood and barbarism do not a good movie make. Substitute the words ""chaos"" and ""catastrophe"" for ""blood"" and ""barbarism"" in the last sentence and you have a statement true of ""Titanic."" In fact, this film was far closer to ""Titanic"" than anything else I can remember. There's even a dead-person's-delight scene at the end -- just like in Titanic.

In fact, I could go so far as to say that ""Titanic"" was the ""chick-flick"" version of what this is, and ""Gladiator"" is a ""guy-flick"" version of ""Titanic."" Maybe the scripts were spit out of the same computer-program with the ""Testosterone Mode"" radio-button selected in the Preferences dialog-box.

Movies like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Sparticus"" shouldn't even be mentioned in the same paragraph as the film I've been writing about for the past 20 minutes... ;c)

10 possible

-1 for hokey Lion-King spiritualism.

-1 for doing the nearly all the standard action cliches.

-1 for the absolutely horrible villain.

-2 for variation on ""Titanic"" themes/feel.

6 September 2004,This gladiator wins,"""Gladiator"" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled.

Also, ""Gladiator"" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome.

""Gladiator"" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; ""The Patriot"" and ""Braveheart"" were very similar to ""Gladiator"" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood.

""Gladiator"" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know ""Gladiator"" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. ""Gladiator"" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.",
20 November 2002,"Mr. Crowe, we love your acting, but we do not love you.","Gladiater is without a doubt the best movie of the new millennium. There are almost no flaws with the filming or acting (aside from the fact the Russell Crowe is in real life a loser). Crowe deserved his accademy award for acting. PLOT. A general in ancient Rome is forced to flee the land after not bowing before the new Emperor ( who killed his own father to be Emporer). And so Maximus ( the general) becomes a slave and must battle through Gladiator combat, hoping to avenge the death of the original emperor. The film is packed with pulsating and gruesome violence and yet incredible acting abillity. 9.5 out of 10. PSSSST! if you watch one of the chariot battles carefully, you can see a gas canister which the film makers needed to flip over one of the chariots!

18 February 2003,Violent with a purpose,"I saw the movie on video because I was nervous of the gore others had mentioned, but the movie was like a poem. You could not have left out one drop of blood, one terrifying character, one disturbing dream, nor could you have added anything at all. Deeply violent, yet not one gratuitous drop of blood was shed, not one encounter without reason. A classically made film, and a beaut. Don't miss it, whether or not you've seen something that disappointed you, or had a bad day at the arena. Think ""Spartacus"" and you've got it.

20 October 2003,"""Braveheart: Redux."" Give me the original any day...","I originally saw ""Gladiator"" (2000) in the year of its release, and after seeing the movie again last night, my position on the film has not changed. I did not like it three years ago, and I still do not like it. Back then I was not reviewing on a professional basis--in fact, I had just started submitting comment/recommendation reviews on the Internet Movie Database. I gave ""Gladiator"" a bad comment and moved on. Now I can criticize it a bit deeper.

""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman soldier who conquers in practically any and every battle. Caesar (Richard Harris) likes Maximus, and so he decides to give the throne to him after he dies and not to his immoral and irresponsible son (Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" a much better movie).

However, when Caesar's plans are revealed to his son, he murders his father and takes his place as Caesar, commanding Maximus to be taken out into the woods to be murdered. However, Maximus, being the great soldier that he is, escapes and flees back home to his wife and child--only to find them burned alive and hanging dead outside the house.

Maximus eventually comes into custody and is thrown in a gladiatorial arena, where he becomes the main star, killing and conquering in every battle. Soon he is like a modern day baseball player--fans line up outside the Colosseum just to see him before the battles begin.

Soon the new Caesar finds out who the great gladiator really is, and so turmoil begins. The new Caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) once loved Maximus, so that is thrown in for good measure, too. While we're at it, let's throw in some futuristic battleships, robots and space aliens that Maximus can fight in the sequel, when he comes back from the dead. (And I'm not kidding about the following--a prequel is planned.)

The movie is slow, and when it picks up speed it goes nowhere. It seems like a rip-off of ""Braveheart"" from beginning to end--a soldier's family is murdered and he takes revenge on the man/nation who killed them by fighting. Granted, he has no choice but to fight in ""Gladiator,"" but still...

The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, the Englishman who directed ""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"" and, among more recent films, ""Matchstick Men."" He's a talented director with an eye for atmosphere, but his films don't always work because sometimes his atmosphere gets the better of him--like in ""Gladiator."" The surroundings are dull, bleak and heartless. ""Braveheart"" had some ounce of beautiful settings, and Mel Gibson used long, wide lens shots of Scotland. Here we just get what we are presented with. And when the camera does pull back to give us the full picture, it's usually packed with very bad CGI effects of Colosseums and such.

And Russell Crowe. How did he ever win (and I do mean it when I say ""win"") an Oscar for this mess? He delivers every line with the same monotone deadness in his voice as thirty minutes earlier in the film. He is and remains one of my least favorite actors, both on and off the screen. And if he wants to beat me up for saying mean things about him (as he usually does to people), he can just come over to my house and try. The greasy-haired baboon.

The dialogue in the movie. Oh my! Things are said that you expect to read in a letter from a six-year-old to his/her parents. (I was just waiting to hear, ""My family is dead. I am sad."")

To be honest, there were a few good moments in ""Gladiator."" It has some impressive fight scenes, including one with two men fighting while tigers leap out of cages built underneath the sand of the arena floor and lunge for the battling duo. I must say that I came close to recommending the movie at certain times. But then it would slow down its pace again and turn into some sort of large-budget cornball. I understand that many people love this movie. Give me ""Braveheart"" any day.

2.5/5 stars.",5
28 August 2005,A Ridley Scott Film.,"Gladiator (2000) is an overrated nightmare. Whoever wrote this did not research their history very well. The acting was mediocre and it was filled with numerous flaws and wholesale gaps of logic. I hate when film makers do this. Why not make it a farce. People would have accepted it as such if they did. If you're going to do a report or a research paper on the Roman Empire, you will fail if you copy from this movie. But, I was impressed with the games in the Roman Colosseum.

Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a roman centurion who's cushy life one day is changed forever. He discovers that he has to live a new life and tries to adjust to it the best way possible Joaquin Phoenix co-stars as Commodus along with Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and the late greats Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott.

Not recommended, unless you're a Russell Crowe fan.

17 April 2022,Maximus Decimus Meridius,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
7 March 2001,An ambitious failure,"While watching ""Gladiator"", I was reminded of a number of films with either a similar setting (""Ben Hur"", ""El Cid"") or a similar storyline (avenge your family's murder like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", or gather a large group of people to fight against a oppressive leadership like ""Braveheart"").

Despite the film's budget and some of director Ridley Scott's impressive visuals, ""Gladiator"" left me cold. The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. ""Gladiator"" felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.

I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including ""Romper Stomper"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and especially, ""The Insider"". I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.

I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of ""I, Claudius"" several decades ago.

Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.

As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive. But unless the script he directs from is really good (e.g., ""Thelma and Louise""), the end product will always be a good-looking but underwhelming movie.",5
2 November 2013,Grand,"Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful and popular Roman general. Emperor Marcus Aurelius is an aging ruler who prefers Maximus than his own conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus kills his own father, Maximus refuses to acknowledge the new emperor and his family is slaughtered. He falls into slavery and the gladiator arenas.

The scale is a grand. The use of CG is top notch. It really expanded the visual experience to the required spectacle. Russell Crowe takes on the big Hollywood leading man role with ease. Joaquin Phoenix is well conceived as the evil foil to Crowe. The movie has the big battles, and the fun gladiator fights. It is grand in the best traditions of Hollywood.

28 June 2014,"""Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity.""","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
21 February 2021,One of the only two films that has won the Oscar and,"Also been my favorite movie of that year. The other of course is Return of the King. Just watched it again and it is simply one of the most perfect movies ever made. Crowe, Phoenix and Nielsen each play one of the greatest heroes, villain and female characters ever created. The score is one of the most heavenly beautiful also ever created. Robbed of an Oscar there. Also robbed of an Oscar was Scott. This is his masterpiece film. Terrific performances by the rest of the supporting cast. Cinematography and special effects are also flawless. And the writing. Crowe offers so many wonderful lines it's almost exhausting including one of my all time favorites ( the part where he reveals himself to everyone ). Of course I remembered all the great lines also uttered by the cast. I envy anyone watching this for the first time. Truly epic.

18 November 2014,"Great Roman Epic, Better On The Second Viewing","When a Roman general (Russell Crowe) is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son (Joaquin Phoenix), he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.

The music is very much like that for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, which should not be surprising given that both come from Hans Zimmer. Did he recycle the music here for ""Pirates"", or is it just a similar style? Hmm.

This is the film that really made Russell Crowe an international star, and helped him earn an Oscar (though it probably should have gone to Geoffrey Rush). This is also probably the best film from Ridley Scott since ""Blade Runner"". While on first viewing it may not seem like anything special, it really does present a great telling of Rome and its problems (fictionalized) and could have parallels to empires today.

26 August 2001,"An excellent, albeit historically inaccurate, film.","A rousing story of one man surviving adversity and destroying a corrupt man in the process, Gladiator is a very entertaining 2 1/2 hour ride. The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.

I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.

OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.

These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of ""going home to see his wife"" really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.

I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a ""super emperor""; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.

Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.

Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.",8
1 January 2021,Simply amazing!,"The story is amazing. This movie is timeless, I've seen it more than a dozen times and every time it's refreshing. It's in my top 3 movies 100%.

14 August 2022,"22 years later, I am very much entertained Maximus!","At first, the run time seems long, but I assure you it is worth every second. The cinematography, the dialogues, the passion, the conviction, Gladiator is worth every second you spend on it. It surely ranks among the best films made and if you don't mind gore and violence, you must watch this. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it, but I'm going to highly recommend this to everybody. I don't want to even describe what a visual thriller it is, how each song captures the essence of the scene or how entertaining and powerful it is. You deserve to experience that for the first time, just like I did. The movie lets you feel an array of emotions and if you concentrate enough, you can feel each major death in your bones. In fact, it was so convincing, I questioned my history and spent a lot of time researching and fact-checking.

This is magic, this is a classic, this is cinema!

P. S. - Why did I assume the movie is much much older? Like the 80s or 90s.",9

The plot is linear,predictable and owes a lot to ""Ben Hur"".Forget the Christ and we have a similar pattern: a hero's downfall,his family is killed (thrown in jail in Ben Hur),he falls into a slaves(gladiators) trader's hands.He takes a spectacular revenge on his enemy (Commodeus,here,Messala in ""Ben Hur"")Outside Wyler's classic,""Gladiator"" finds some inspiration in Kubrik's ""Spartacus"" and LeRoy's ""Quo Vadis"" too,and even in Delmer Daves'""Demetrius and the gladiators"" (1954)All these sword and sandals,except Daves'one,are superior to Ridley Scott's work.Of course,the battle scenes are impressive,thanks to technology ,but it does not make up for the paucity of the dialogue and the simplicism of the screenplay.The ""poetic"" slow motion ending has been filmed so many times that one wonders why Scott could bother with such a rehash.",5
18 April 2020,Incredible historical drama,"Despite a few obvious filmmaking errors, Gladiator is still an incredible historical drama that's epic and emotional. Russell Crowe gives an incredible lead performance and Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou, Connie Nelson and Oliver Reed are all great. Ridley Scott's direction is great, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The production values are consistently extremely impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is incredibly epic.

29 December 2000,The great epic movies were finally surpassed,"This movie is so well done, that you are overwhelmed. I can frankly say that there is not even a single boring moment during the whole length. I will begin my description with the shooting. The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known. You just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great epic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed.",10
31 March 2019,Ridley Scott's defining masterpiece,"Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.

Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).

Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons. Ridley Scott has earned his reputation here.",10
11 March 2021,Are you not entertained!?,"I love this movie. I have a few absolute favorites and this tops my charts. Russell Crowe is at his greatest in his role of Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix is the man to hate fighting for power and Rome hates him for it. I pity his sister Connie Lucilla who fights to hide her love for Maximus. I can't help but to cry at the end. I have seen it so many times but, I weep in the end, no matter. I'm so happy to be able to watch it again. I need to just break down and buy the disc and add it to my scant few copies of my likes.

5 March 2017,"""Death Smiles At Us All. All We Can Do Is Smile Back""","For all you really avid movie-watchers out there, think about this question for a minute: Have you ever seen a movie starring Russell Crowe where you said ""that was really bad?"". I didn't think so either.

For a basic plot summary, ""Gladiator"" tells the story of Maximus (Crowe), one-time member of the Roman army turned gladiator slave at the hands of tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.

Despite starting off quite slow for the first 30-40 minutes, ""Gladiator"" quickly becomes top- notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role. Without his presence in this film, I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance. His gravitas on screen carries itself almost without dialogue whatsoever.

This is also the kind of film (much like Crowe's later work ""Robin Hood"") that is quite long but only builds on itself. It takes some time for the real drama to really kick in, but when it does it is all the more pertinent because of the character development we have already seen.

Overall, ""Gladiator"" is a great movie that has a little something for everyone. If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours. I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.",9
19 May 2000,For the Love of Rome! What a disappointment....,"Ridley Scott has made a real loser. The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to ""Braveheart"" in parts --- ""Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in ""Braveheart"" and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in ""Braveheart."" Plus in ""Braveheart"" there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, ""behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child."" It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that ""it must've been a blade"" by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the ""go home Maximus"" and the ""Lucius is safe"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the ""majestic collosium"" only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot. Christ, even the CGI birds were splotches on the screen...

Anyway, there are a few things that were ok - Reed and Crowe were pretty good. Phoenix was ok as the ""unloved by daddy"" emperor. The actress Connie Neilsen who played Lucilla was pretty good and well as Maximus' two ""buddy"" Gladiators. In short, a lousy script, well-acted but 2-dimensional characters, and messy camera shots made this only another film that disappointed me. A 6.5 out of 10 (D) --- Go watch any bit of ""Spartacus,"" two scenes from ""Braveheart,"" and the first 15 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan."" You'll have the same damn movie.",8

16 March 2005,Are you not entertained?,"Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.

It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into.

Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core.

Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is ""in danger of becoming a good man"". Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.

I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand. Are you not entertained? At the very least, you should be.

5 May 2017,"Overrated Entertainment for the Easily Pacified ""Mob"" with Dated CGI","The New Millennium Begins with this ""Time Machine"" Movie that was and has become one of the most Popular, Award Winning Films in Recent History.

History is Tweaked by the Journey, 2,000 Years Ago, when Rome was Kicking Ass and Decadent as the Fall of the Empire was Beginning.

A Central Theme in Ridley Scott's Blockbuster is Rome's Politics, Corruption and Direction for the Future. But that is Hardly the Thing that Sold this one to the ""Mob"".

It's Epic Appeal, mostly done with CGI, was its Bloodletting, Hero/Saviour (the muscled up Russell Crowe), and its Simplistic Display of ""Wrestle-Mania"" Spectacle.

Joaquin Phoenix is the Over the Top, Effeminate, Incestuous, Megalomaniac Villain. Connie Nielsen is His Sister with Her Young 8 Year Old Son in Tow that Phoenix uses for Blackmailing Her into Submission.

Other Supporting Characters make Mild Impressions. Oliver Reed as a Slave (Gladiator) Trader, Derek Jacobi as a Senator, Djimon Hounsou as Crowe's Token Sidekick, and Richard Harris as the Aging Caesar.

Overall, it is a Lazy, Hazy, Sword and Sandal Modernization that has more Pretensions than it can Sustain. Not Taken Seriously it's an Entertaining Oscar Hog that is Overrated but Worth a Watch. The CGI doesn't Hold Up all that well, but in 2000 A.D., it had some Appeal.",7

9 July 2009,"Breathtaking, entertaining and brilliant","Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled ""Thumbs down"", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome ‚Äì an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.

The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.

Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).

Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in ""Blade Runner"" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.

The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""300""), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.",10

15 December 2016,Epically overrated - even the music,"This picture is epically overrated- it is not the number 46 of the 250 best movies, like the IMDb ratings system states at the time of writing of this review. Because it simply never should have been even near such top 250 list. Aside from a clearly visible big budget, only three things are worth of mentioning: shots of hand brushing thorough stalks of wheat (which are iconic), ""Are you not entertained?!"" shout out moment (of intensive emotions) and the point of story when there is a conspiracy created ""to get him out"" (which in turn leads to a few minutes of enjoyable suspense). Other than that, this picture is quite boring and mediocre

It is suppose to be an epic story, but it does not suck you in on any scale. Instead of that it just epically blows, like if it was a giant blown egg shell- decorated on the outside, but empty on the inside. Even the very first battle in the woods has some stupid visual techniques, with addition of some dog disguised as a wolf saving his master- and what a load of kitsch that was. And the kitsch comes back in epic size at the grand finale- the only missing thing at that point is a group of gladiators singing ""Kumbaya"" to the crowd of cheering and crying spectators

In this picture even the music is way below expectations. Yes, there are some good moments, but overall in the beginning and at the end the music is rather weak, while in the middle it is somewhat without a taste or noticeable substance. And what is more, the Wikipedia says that Hans Zimmer took some of this music from Gustav Holst and Richard Wagner. But there is more to it- most likely he also borrows from Henryk Gorecki. And on top of that, some tracks sound like a reworked version of music from ""The Rock"" [1996]"", which Hans Zimmer co-composed; and also there is a musical motive in the ""Gladiator"" that he later on simply reused for the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie series. But what is the most disturbing in regards to the score is the fact, that he got nominated for that work by Academy Awards, while the co-composer Lisa Gerrard did not. So it is just ridiculous that the music which is at best mediocre got nominated, but at the same time it is scandalous, that only the man of the two persons that created it received such nomination. (Of course all those Oscars prizes for music / songs should not be viewed as something like some kind of musical Metre Convention agreements)

But what is most important- it does not matter, if you watch this movie in crappy conditions at the time of its release when you are entering your young adulthood, or if you watch it some 15 years later on a good home cinema system when you are an adult. It is still boring and also flat to some extent

Do not waste your time on this one. Go watch a ""Spartacus"" (2004) instead- although it is a TV movie and was not intended to play in the same league as Ridley Scott does with his big bucks flicks, that ""Spartacus"" beats the ""Gladiator"" almost to the ground (but also in no way constitutes as one of the 250 greatest movies ever made)",3
13 August 2001,Spectacular in every way,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8

7 December 2005,"""I am Spartacus-I mean-Maximus!""","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.

Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.

I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena.

The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.

It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, ""When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?""). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.

Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.",
10 May 2000,awful,"I was sooo hyped to see this movie. You have no idea. But my God, it wasnt just bad, it was awful. I'm sitting here staring at the glowing Entertaintment Weekly review and I just cant believe it. Other reviews for the most part are just as good. Did everybody else go to a different movie then I did? Did they not see an overlong bore? Did they not see the maybe 2 or so facial expressions Russel Crowe used in the movie that is supposed to be good acting? Did they not see the action scenes that were put in fast motion and slow motion that were completely unneeded, unartistic, and unoriginal? I wonder if Ridley Scott could have ripped off Spielberg a little more? And the dialogue! Did I hear the young emperor say, ""Im very vexed, terrible vexed!"" I laughed out loud. Was that supposed to be that funny? Or was that just horrifically bad writing? And how about those lovely computer generated lions? Complete trash. How can you people be giving this movie 10's and sending it into the top 100 already. Let there be a backlash please. Movies this bad deserve one.

28 October 2005,consistently indescribably superb,"Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!",10
2 January 2001,Maximus Movie,"We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good ""Albatross"" or the really weird ""G. I. Jane"", but fortunately he is came back with a success like ""Gladiator"" and a promising title like ""Hannibal"". Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita √® Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard. Wonderful!",10
5 November 2019,Another Ridley Scott masterpiece,"There is very little fault one can find in this film. It is the story of Maximus, a roman general who is betrayed by the son of his Caesar. After escaping execution, Maximus ends up fighting as a gladiator, with an eye for vengeance. Russell Crowe is magnificent in this role. He brings such poise and humility to the character, it is impossible not to be sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is equally as excellent in his role, and the polar opposite of Maximus. I would not only recommend this movie, but I would further insist that you watch the director's cut. It comes in at just under three hours of run time, but it will certainly not feel like it. I would put this in my top 10 movies you should see before you die list.

12 July 2010,Ridley Scott at His Most Laughably Serious,"Absolutely ridiculous bit of sword and sandal nonsense that wouldn't have been so objectionable had not director Ridley Scott and his cast taken the damn thing so seriously. It didn't help matters any that it went on to win the Best Picture Oscar, the dumbest pick since perhaps ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" back in 1952 (though that film is far more entertaining).

I guess the Academy felt they had shafted Russell Crowe the year before when he didn't win for ""The Insider."" That's the only reasonable explanation I can offer for how he managed to take the Best Actor prize for this. If you're dying to see Crowe in a loin cloth, run don't walk to your Netflix queue to add this one. But if not, just rent ""Spartacus"" and be done with it.

Grade: C

9 October 2015,Really good film with an opening battle scene that is incredible!,"Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction! But enjoyable fiction with the formulaic mistake of turning the main protagonist into something of a superhero and that's why it isn't getting a 10!",9
27 December 2000,An unexpected pleasure!,"I was expecting a action flick and to my delight found a beautifully crafted historically accurate and totally engrossing masterpiece. Wow! Who would have thought anything this good could come out in the so-called ""New Millennium""? It harkens back to the great movies of yesteryear in its honesty, its willingness to treat the viewer as an intelligent human being. Perhaps there is hope for humans after all.

15 July 2005,Ave!,"Okay, I'll admit that I didn't consider ""Gladiator"" the best movie of 2000, but it did have it's merits, namely that it focused on plot rather than violence. Russell Crowe certainly did a good job as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix made a nasty Commodus. Although that was sort of the problem: the good guy was 100% good and the bad guy was 100% bad. It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.

But other than that, it was a really good movie. Since we had just gone to Italy when the movie came out (we went for the millennium jubilee), it made the movie all the neater. I guess that you could say: the movies that we watch in life echo in our eternities.

22 October 2008,Too many errors and an actor made out of wood,"There are a couple of reasons I didn't really like Gladiator.

First and foremost is Russell Crowe. I'm an Australian and while it seems a little unpatriotic, the guy is pure wood. He is the new Charles Bronson who has one expression and sticks to it.

Thus I had a problem when he supposedly 'sells himself to the crowd'. I'm also a wrestling fan and I can only guess that 'selling' must mean something different to the people who made this film. Crowe does no selling here.

The other problem I have is some biiiiig holes in the plot. Commodus becomes the new Emperor and sentences Maximus, and his family, to death. Maximus kills the guards and rides as fast as he can for home. So fast he kills both of the horses he rides although he might have been a little faster if the cinematographer didn't decide that he absolutely had to put in some visual effect to boost his career.

Anyway, he gets home and Roman legions had already arrived, tortured and raped his family, hanged them and then left. My question, how did they know? Did Commodus, still up in Germanica somewhere pull out his cell phone and make a call?! I mean, Maximus goes as fast as he can but the enemy troops seem to not only know Commodus' orders but that he is the new Emperor.

A friend of mine said that there were communication methods that could have been used. Carrier pigeons, signal towers, etc. Fine, but if the film makers want me to buy that, they should show me this.

Next, Maximus falls to the ground grieving for his dead family and then boom, next scene, he's a wounded slave. How did this happen? Even more curious is why a slaver bothered with caring for a wounded slave with the Mediterranean so close by to act as a dumping ground.

Third, I still can't understand how Maximus manages to become such an acclaimed gladiator. Nothing I saw endured me toward him and while he was a general that doesn't make him an exceptional fighter. I don't know if I'd win a fight against General Schwarzkopf or Collin Powell but I bet Mike Tyson could beat them in a fight.

Finally, all the other anachronisms just added up to cause my poor suspension of disbelief to evaporate.",3
30 October 2003,An Epic,"I thought this movie a bit of a throwback to the days of the epic film. This had everything movies like Spartacus and Ben Hur had, plus a bit extra since special effects are so much more advanced. The storylines which were woven together I found compelling. The sets were majestic, especially looking at old Rome. This movie obviously had a lot of careful planning and hard work, and it paid off beautifully. It even does well on small screen. But it is much better on the large.

I saw it several times when I was a kid, unfortunately, back then I did not cherish it as I now. Huge applause for all the people who worked on this movie and especially the starring role as ""MAXIMUS"".

29 January 2002,A cut above....,"...the standard Sword 'n Sandal epic. Russell Crowe propels this film in a tour de force of a performance, ably supported by a solid supporting cast. Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.

The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for ""toilet"". One of the most repulsive creations ever put on celluloid by an actor. Can't blame him though, there had to be something substantial to match Crowe's massive screen presence. Bloody good.

31 October 2021,"""Are you not entertained?""","This is a proper film that truly stands out. Gladiator could by all means be called the greatest movie ever made, though i wouldn't, but it's up there with the best of the best.

Visually this film is perfect. The CGI, the combat, the sound and editing is some of the finest ever seen in cinema history.

Although some of the story didn't really happen in real life, i still think the storytelling is flawless. It's truly amazing, but also an incredibly sad and tragic story with probably the most beautiful ending ever.

Russell Crowe as Maximus is brilliant and the role fits him perfectly. His best role and performance ever. But the stand out performance for me was Joaquin Phoenix portraying the evil emperor Commodus. This might just be his best performance ever, but it's very close with his role as Arthur Fleck in Joker.

In conclusion: Gladiator is one of the finest movies ever made.

10 January 2004,"Great acting, great battle scene's, great music, great costumes, great movie!","I have heard many people refer to this movie as a ""Braveheart"" rip-off or as a movie that tried to make some cash out of the success of ""Braveheart"". I don't think that's completely fair. Sure there are some similarities but ""Gladiator"" is original enough with an own unique style.

The movie has a very good unique atmosphere like we are used from Ridley Scott movies. Visually the movie looks wonderful (with the exception of a few fake looking background shots of Rome). Especially the battle scene's (the gladiator fights in particular) are filmed in a wonderful way with some good editing and are something you have never seen before. You can almost feel the tension and fear and smell the sweat of the gladiators when they are entering the arena.

The acting is top class! Russell Crowe is a great leading man but was his role Oscar worthy? I don't think so, he deserved an Oscar more for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Joaquin Phoenix gives an impressive performance and the same goes for Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and yes, Spencer Treat Clark that shows his talent.

What makes the movie even more complete is the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer and the great looking costumes and epic settings and feeling.

But no the movie is not perfect. The story at times is messy and at times it loses it's speed. It feels like it's just a lame excuse to fill up the scene's between the gladiator fights. Also some characters and moments don't feel needed at all, I don't know I can't really put my finger on it. But it's not a bad thing, the good things about the movie makes you actually forget the bad things.

Worth watching if only just for the spectacular and impressive battle scene's.

15 November 2016,Disappointed,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6

15 June 2001,Good epic film...overall grade: 8 (out of 10).,"The best way to analyze this film is to compare it to another famous gladiator film, Spartacus (1960).

Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) vs. Russell Crowe (Maximus Decimus Meridius)

The winner is: Russell Crowe (by a long shot). I liked Russell Crowe in this film. His performance is what keeps the movie generated with electricity from start to finish. Although Douglas was good as Spartacus, I found Crowe's performance much better.

Laurence Olivier (Crassus) vs. Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus)

The winner is: Laurence Olivier. No actor could steal a screen performance like Olivier. Phoenix goes overboard with his character in some scenes.

Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) vs. Oliver Reed (Proximo)

The winner is: a draw.

I liked both characters from each film. Ustinov won an Oscar for his Supporting role, but Reed was equally impressive, too.

Direction: Stanley Kubrick vs. Ridley Scott

The winner is: Kubrick (by a long shot).

Special Effects: The winner is Spartacus. One example is the mammoth battle scene towards the end of the film. Gladiator is littered with computerized special effects.

I feel Spartacus still holds my interest as best gladiator film ever made. The only thing that holds Gladiator together is Crowe's performance.

Spartacus: 8.5 (out of 10). Gladiator: 8 (out of 10).",
28 June 2000,Only good entertainment,"The only thing that could be said about Gladiator, the last Ridley Scott's movie, is good entertainment. But is not far from the scheme of the classical American action movie: the male protagonist, his revenge to obtain, the final duel with the villain. The initial scene of the night battle promised other and higher emotions...

By the way I was born in Rome and I live in Rome and the ancient Rome of the movie is not a good representation.

29 November 2006,Enough! Die Already!,"Gladiator is easily one of the most overrated movies ever. After a lot of good reviews and a few Oscars, Perhaps this could be decent. Again, what is the big deal everyone!? I should have listened to Ebert and Roeper who did not like this movie at all. They where on to something.

Gladiator is also a very long movie that seemingly goes on for at least ten hours. I saw this movie on PPV, and I found myself walking in and out of my own living room. This is incredibly boring and dull. The story is unoriginal and uninteresting. Perhaps the action sequences will be saving grace. Perhaps not. The action sequences were choppy and very hard to follow and The opening battle scene is so poorly directed that I did not know what was going on at all. Terrible.

The acting was wooden. Russel Crowe was not Oscar winning here at all. Phoenix also was not good here as the evil son. I did not see anyone enjoying their roles here at all. How this won so many Oscars will forever be a mystery to me. Best Picture?! My ass. I wanted the ""Gladiator"" to die quickly to end my misery. What a waste of my time.

The Last Word: Boooooring. Beware the hype. Heed my warning. This sucks.",1

9 February 2009,One of the best movies I've seen - especially among modern films,"I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.

So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).

This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.

Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.

I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.

I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!",10
13 March 2012,A Masterpiece!,"Ridley Scott's Best-Picture Oscar-Winner 'Gladiator' is A Masterpiece. A Breath-Taking, Magnum Opus, that is equally as stunning & compelling. Also, Russell Crowe's Oscar-Winning Performance, is no less than a Milestone itself.

'Gladiator' Synopsis: When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.

'Gladiator' catches you from the word GO. The entire film, is historically made & is stunning from every aspect. David Franzoni, John Logan & William Nicholson's Screenplay is Masterful. It's gripping, emotional & magnificently well-worded. Ridley Scott's Direction is Fabulous. The legendary filmmaker proves his mettle once again by handling & delivering such an epic film! Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design, are pitch-perfect. Visual Effects are excellent.

Performance-Wise: As mentioned before, Russell Crowe's Oscar-Winning Performance, is no less than a Milestone itself. Crowe plays Maximus Decimus Meridius, spell-bindingly. It ranks amongst the very best performances of all-times. Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar-Nominated Performance as the ruthless villain, is something to watch. He plays the bad-guy most convincingly. Connie Nielsen is wonderful. Djimon Hounsou is superb! The Great Richard Harris is flawless, as always.

On the whole, 'Gladiator' is a Masterpiece!",10
4 July 2021,Great...but not a perfect 10,"As much as I love this movie, it could be even better. More specifically, it seems that some essential scenes were cut that are extremely important for understanding everything. Also, some of the dialogue doesn't make any sense. Fortunately, there's an extended cut that solves most of these issues.

My 9 star rating goes out to the extended cut. The theatrical cut scores a 7.

23 June 2020,An Essential Revenge Movie!,"Both my Dad and my Brother say this movie's overrated, I don't. Gladiator is everything I could ever ask for and more. I find the most common complaint is that the story is too simple and basic, but there's nothing wrong with that. Sure it's always great to see movies subvert genre conventions, but if there was any movie that did the basic tale of revenge to such an epic level, it was Gladiator.

The characters are iconic, supported by powerful performances. Crowe's Oscar for best actor is well deserved and I will always remember Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, the action scenes are intense and spectacular, the visuals are astonishing and the music is breathtaking, creating an overall epic and emotional experience like no other.

Not only is this my favourite Ridley Scott movie, but it's simply one of my favourite movies of all time. If you haven't yet, watch Gladiator.

18 March 2001,OK to see before going out for a beer.,"Well, it's certainly loud and bloody. The digital effects are reasonable, the acting is competent throughout. It's, um, another big Hollywood flick. So what's not to like? I guess if you're at all fussy about how you spend 3 hours of your life then you'd best not waste it in the dark with this one. Ridley Scott, who has brought such a wonderful to feel to so many of his other films succeeds only in making this one dark and distant. We never get close enough to the characters to care about them. On the other hand, if you want something easy to talk about over a beer, well then by all means...

11 April 2001,The Academy bows to what Hollywood is ridiculed for,"First of all, Gladiator is NOT an epic!!!! I know there are sites that claim that historically it is true, but let's be honest...no emperor will ever fight a Gladiator. EVER!!! No matter who the Gladiator really is, just imagine Spartacus fighting the emperor. Umm...no!

Second of all --- there is no way Gladiator deserved the Oscar for movie of the year...Sure it deserved to get all the technical decorations and computer animation and whatever else they did to make the Coliseum and all the special effects, but BEST MOVIE?? Is the Academy on crack?

Third of all -- there was no strong acting...NONE!! There were some touching scenes and some beautiful scenes of nature and blood for that matter (if you find that thrilling), but not one actor did a wonderful job acting...They were all predictable. Of course the girl loved the hero and the father didn't love the son, etc., etc. A cliche on top of cliche is all this movie is made of and then it gets an Oscar. Well at least next year the Oscars will be better because they couldn't possibly screw up more this year.

And lastly, when I leave a movie theater, I would like to have something to think about because of a movie I just saw. Some sort of a greater, bigger picture. Here we had a point that being dishonest and weak fires back! That's an original! And it certainly take three hours to deliver that point to the audience. I am not even arguing for good movies to be recognized because given what I think is good may not be the standard for everyone else, but let us not recognize something that is unworthy of it. I was also disappointed in Russel Crowe because I did not expect him to go from LA Confidential and The Insider to crap like Gladiator.",5
1 January 2022,STRENGTH AND HONOR,"I rewatched this movie last night for the first time after more than 2 decades and what should I say... It's still one of the greatest movies of all times. Crowe and Phoenix are awesome in their performances, so is the rest of the cast.

It's loaded with violence, pathos, revenge. Basically everything I enjoy in movies.

29 March 2002,Good Hollywood Epic,"It strikes me from the readers comments of the IMDB that as many people dislike GLADIATOR as like it. True it`s the sort of story we`ve seen before in several genres where good defeats evil but what`s wrong with that ? It`s well acted with Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of villain the right side of camp , well supported by a bunch of British thespians - Notice how many of the bad guys are played by Americans and good guys by Brits . Don`t see that too often - and Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops to make GLADIATOR a technical triumph , a shame he didn`t win the Oscar for best director , he`ll be hard pushed to make a film as good as this again. And accolades to John Mathieson and Hans Zimmer for photography and music respectively.

GLADIATOR is one of three old fashioned Hollywood epics to have won the Oscar for best picture in recent years . After seeing the overrated BRAVEHEART and the truly awful TITANIC and comparing them with true epics like GONE WITH THE WIND , BEN HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I thought to myself "" Alas they don`t make them like they used to "". Then GLADIATOR came along and proved me wrong.

As a footnote the DVD release to this film is excellent. If anyone at Columbia pictures is reading this can we please a similar standard of release for Scott`s upcoming DVD of BLACKHAWK DOWN ?",7
26 March 2008,"I am Maximus, mumble, grunt, rasp!","I can't even describe how much I loath this film, but being a hater I'll try.

Lets begin with the historical representation first. Personally I don't give a hoot if the facts are all wrong, if the uniforms and clothing and use of weaponry are historically incorrect. (People who's concerns about this dragon of a film tend that way, I gave those geeks wedgies in High-school) But the representation of the Roman empire as a benign benefactor spreading civilization through out the world is ludicrous, such sentiments belong to the aforementioned wedgie sufferers and elitist euro-republicans.

Then there's the script, which is a pathetic attempt at lyrical writing, even Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson could do a better job. Never the less, it was amusing in a so-bad-it's-funny sorta way.

And Russel Crowe, let's not forget the torment of watching Russel Crowe act. It's like his brawling: fake and an attempt to hide his 80's new wave rock alter ego; Russ Le Rock. But his constipated stoicism and grunting and mumbling will appear as the classic lone warrior acting to the low-brows who love this film.

Oh, Yes and then there's the music. When I heard Rock like rhythms played over roman soldiers marching, I laughed out loud, usually anachronistic film-scoring is the fort√© of Asian cinema, that can pull this stunt. The music only got worse, from new-age warbling of Lisa Gerrad to pompous choir passages, that even Howard Shore would be ashamed to use.

This movie was a non wavering onslaught of boredom and cinematic torture, and I for one was happy when the credits rolled.",1

24 April 2021,Great Movie,"Great story. Lots of violence and action. Mr Phoenix is a brilliant actor. He does a great job being a villain. Oliver Reed died in real life half way through this movie. That story is quite interesting in itself. It's quite amazing what they did with that character after the real actors death.

9 July 2000,"expensive production, realistic details, but not the story","well, these movies are all the same. super expensive production, huge cast, stunning tricks and lot of ketchup spilled to arrange the bloody details. the production is awesome, acting not bad, but the story is not realistic at all. it seems to me that there is new wave of such movies, which were most popular in sixties coming on right now. the new ones are much more graphic, but often lack the atmosphere in comparison to the old ones. but i have to admit, gladiator is not that bad all in all. i like the opening scene especially, that is a masterpiece.

26 March 2001,Can't Hold up Braveheart's Jockstrap!,"One word, overrated. This movie was a good movie, but best picture nominated? No. Winner of the Best picture? Disgusting. Oh and Russell Crowe the best actor? Ridiculous! Now we have finally arrived at an all-time low in movies and the oscars. This has made me wish that I was born in another time, when the likes of Clark Gable, Bogart, and other legends graced the screen. We today have all but lost the brilliance and epic quality that we once had at the movies. Here's to the next Spielberg or Hitchcock whoever you are, because we need you in the worst way.

For those of you about to vomit from the oscars, I salute you!

4 February 2001,Overrated. But Good in Parts.,"This film was a bit too long for me. And after all the hype, I found it to be a little disappointing.

Nevertheless, If you have a spare 2 and half hours to kill, and have nothing better, and you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend it.

I can watch a film over and over, if I like it enough. Sadly, this is not one of those movies. Once is enough. Maybe I'll watch it again, if it comes on TV at Christmas. But thats about it.

An incredibly overrated movie, but enjoyable in parts.

11 May 2000,The best movie in years...FOR ME TO POOP ON,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of most of Ridley Scott's work. Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either. Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film. What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time. Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later. About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better. I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter. I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end. I probably would've left but I attended the film with my father and we hadn't been to a movie together since T2...what're ya gonna do?.

Gladiator was lifeless and unoriginal. The plot was shabby and often laughable, and I honestly believe the folks at MST3K could've had a pretty good time with it. Much of the dialogue was cheesy, the camera work was largely uninspired and every time a computer generated 'roman' backdrop was on screen the characters amidst them were fuzzy and shadowy. At other times Scott included footage to purposely sicken the audience, i.e. the ""snot"" scene. Did anyone else find that as nasty as I?

Another problem with this film as that, despite its epic running time, the plot progression is hasty and incomplete. Maximus goes from general to slave in about 3 scenes(why is he a slave again?) and kills around 7 people as a gladiator before becoming the most popular man in Rome. There's plenty of room for good development within two and a half hours. Instead, Scott pushes Gladiator's sub-par progression only within the brief action scenes(the only interesting scenes in the entire movie...honestly) and offsets them with minutes upon minutes(hours?) of crap that doesn't go anywhere. The raves this movie has received confuse me. Gladiator is the most overrated movie in years.

If you're looking for a good movie along the same lines, watch Conan the Barbarian. Gladiator uses roughly the same story line, but Conan is about 3000 times more entertaining. And don't get popcorn before you enter the theater. Believe me, you'll welcome any excuse to get up and stretch your legs before the movie actually concludes.",1
28 July 2000,Why on Earth Did Everyone Like This Movie?,"This movie is bad. Not extremely bad, but bad nonetheless. It was extremely long and boring, seeing as the plot was paper-thin. The characters were dull. I couldn't care less, if Russell Crowe won in the end. I didn't feel sorry for his character at any point in the movie. In fact, by the second hour, I found myself wishing for his immediate death so they'd end the movie. I blame most of the movie's problems on director Ridley Scott. He's a hideous director, and I don't know why everyone keeps confusing him with a good director. During half of the fight scenes and during the battle scene at the beginning, it took the entire scene just to figure out what was happening. You could never tell what was going on. Thus, this movie isn't even good for a few cheap thrills. It isn't good: C-

7 September 2022,There is nothing in it,"Toxic movies that I hate forever I really believe that films like this harm not only the cinema but also our world.

The script is zero. The mise-en-sc√®nes are the level of a beginner director. The camera movement is similar to the movement of the camera in many promotional teasers (especially the chariot part).

Filming fights is no different from the films that are taken from wrestling, boxing and karate competitions, maybe they are even better. The opening of the movie is inefficient. Ridley Scott tries to combine music with cinematography, but fails. There is nothing good in this movie, everything is made up of ordinary and incomplete sub-narratives that are achieved with a lot of funny trickery. The ups and downs of, for example, the hero of the film have an uncertainty or even false excitement .The family has no definition in the film and is captured by the director's absurd slogans. Of course, I like Ridley Scott's movies.

Although I know who made this movie so enlargement here.",1
4 September 2022,"""Scotty, beam me up"" - Ridley Scott gives you a taste of ancient Rome","The Colosseum... A place that stands not only for being one of the most beautiful monuments of the Roman Empire, but also a place at which many a great warrior has died. Death in the service of keeping the people of Rome entertained, preventing them from even thinking of an uprising against the ruling caesar. Even today, many peolle travel specifically to Rome to see the remnants of this huge palace of entertainment.

That Rome stands central in a movie called ""Gladiator"" may be not that remarkable. What though is remarkable that there was such a long time since the last popular movie in the ""swords and sandals""-genre... Actually, it was 1958 - with a movie named ""Ben Hur"" - that we saw such a highly rated movie in its genre.

And the wait was more than wortwile! Because Gladiator tells its story - in the most intricate of detail - in an extremely beautiful way! The buildings, vehicles, clothing, weapons and other props are all so beautiful that they just suck you up in the world of ancient Rome. The scenery is just so breathtaking that it will leave you with the impression that you just sat yourself on the bleachers of the Colloseum!

The storyline is losely based on the real rulers of the second century Roman empire. Marcus Aurelius and his evil son Conmodus form the basis of the story. It is thereby one of the Roman generals named Maximus that stands central in this movie. Played by Russell Crowe, Maximus is forced to become a Gladiator. And the life of that Gladiator stands central in this movie.

The supreme acting of not only Crowe but also many of the other actors makes this movie belong to a list of movies that you can watch multiple times during your life. And you are wrong if you think that its 2h35m duration may cause you to get bored. My own experience was that the movie was over before I even noticed it! And mind you, this was already the second time that I watched this movie since it was released.

Watching this movie was such a great experience that I gave it a well-deserved 10 stars. I will most certainly watch this movie again in the future.",10
11 May 2000,"over-blown, over-violent and historically outrageous","I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks. What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.

First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length. (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.

I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful. I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity. I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies. Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is ""righteous"" violence meted out by the hero.

Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history. The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy. Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor. Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie.",1

20 December 2016,admirable work,"one of rare contemporary films who is, obvious, very, very close to be defined as perfect. because it illustrates a collection of virtues , many long time ignored, few not very familiar first, it is a great eulogy to a favorite genre of classic Hollywood. same recipes, same craft, same vision, same style. a Spartacus of a new millennium. then, it is a film of actors more than one of ""tricks"". and to say Russell Crowe/Oliver Reed/Joaquin Phoenix/Richard Harris does a great job is far to be enough. because the genius of Ridley Scott is to give not parts but an entire fresco. so, it is the film of each actor and fight scene and dramatic moment and touching sequence and fragment of impressive Rome. mix of poetry and history and epic and science of detail, it is a classic. it sounds precious but it is only the truth. because it is , in same measure, a film for heart and mind. and a courageous exercise to resurrect the force and fascinations of the historical blockbusters from the decades VII - VIII.

21 November 2000,THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE IN HISTORY!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",1
20 January 2003,how a movie like this has a high rating?,"i don't understand how a movie so crappy like this one ever got this high rating. first i must say that ridley scott is considered by me an awfull director. alien was the only good movie he ever directed. blade runner is totally overrated, black rain shouldn't be considered a movie, 1492 is completely ridiculous, black hawk down is one of the worse war movies i have ever seen and hannibal is only an ok film.

the plot is ludicrous. a gladiator, former army man, that begins a personal vendetta against the emperor and finally gets away with it? i don't think so. there is also this kind of love story between him and lucilla that is totally out of place.

cast is awful. russel crowe is dull as maximus and he certainly doesn't look as a gladiator. he had better performances in ""a beautiful mind"" and in ""l. a confidential"". joaquin pheonix is absurd as usual, let's face it, this man can't act, a few tears doesn't prove him a good actor, pitty river phoenix is dead (that was trully a good actor). richard harris is poor as marcus aurelius and oliver reed is surprisingly bad as some sort of gladiator manager.

still, the movie has some good points: drek jacobi is very good as a senator and the first battle scene is a real joy. but this two things doesn't save the rest of the movie.

i almost forgot: it's very overlong, seems like it will never finish. 2/10.",8
15 August 2023,Fantastic Ridley Scott,"As Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott rose during the seventies with two masterpieces: DUELLISTS and ALIEN. Spielberg, JAWS, DUEL, ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.... Both were then rather young to bring such jewels. Scott is ten years older than his ""opponent"" but both have in common to continue, after all those decades, to provide regularely other masterpieces, and both have made around 30-35 movies, and for both of them - again- NAPOLEON film for Scott and mini series for Spielberg are also in their calendar. So GLADIATOR is a milestone for the sword and sandal - peplum - genre. Because the last ones were the Italian - and some American - productions from the early sixties, and as far as I know, there were not since. It was a kind of films totally forgotten from the bulk of audiences; but not the die hard movie goers, of course. This movie is unique, awesome, outstanding and opened the way, a boulevard, to many others: TROY,300 being the most widely known. The new, young audiences then discovered what their elders loved when they - youngest - were not even born. Ridley Scott resurrected the sword and sandal film genre with this one. And many sequences - particularely the hand of Russel Crowe touching the wheat field, was taken in at least one hundred other films and even commercials. Scott came from commercials business, during the seventies. Maybe this explains that.",

27 March 2021,Gladiator is an epic Ancient Roman historic drama Masterpiece,"Gladiator is an epic Ancient Roman historic drama masterpiece. Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. This is still one of the most breathtaking and epic gladiator movies that I have ever seen. A masterpiece by Ridley Scott with a soulful music ""Now we are free"" that gives you goosebumps not to forget the brilliant screenplay by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, and Oliver Reed. If you haven't seen this movie it's time to sit in front of a large screen with surround sound and simply enjoy being transported back in time.

Hope people won't remember him only for Joker, because in this movie he is so extraordinarily hateful.

The film makers are in the story-telling business, they're not history teachers!!! and ppl only say sparticus is better cos Kubrick is dead and they are too proud to admit that a new film can beat a classic!!

The story is entertaining. The characters are believable. The computer graphics range from breath-taking to slightly out of synch. The background score is exceptional and combined with usual Ridley Scott visual style, this film is a winner!!

7 May 2021,Incredible,"Praising this movie is sorta like feeding a fattened pig, but I want to show my appreciation for this movie too so I don't care. I genuinely came into this movie simply expecting some well executed action and some good performances, but now I realize just how much deeper this movie is. This film has drama, an easy to follow story, incredible performances, fantastic writing, and unmatched set design. In all honesty, I loved the performances and story so much in this film that the action might have been my least favorite part of it. Between Russel Crowe's simple but powerful performance to Joaquin Phoenix's literally unbeaten performance as an unstable psychopath filled with rage, there was always something interesting and nail biting going on. Some people may think this film is overhyped, and in certain respects I can understand that, but personally I believe this is a must see for anyone who likes movies.

5 September 2005,"Roar of Battle, the Roar of Crowds","Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal & staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.

But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife & son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal & political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.

The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.

Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.",9
28 January 2022,Classic,"There's no need for a long review here. Crowe is fantastic. His best role ever. Phoenix is mesmerizing. The visuals are stunning. I've probably seen it 30x and still can never flip past it when it's on tv. In short it's one of the 50 best movies ever. It should be on every list. Watch it.

10 April 2014,The power of vision,"Here the interesting thing worth commenting is vision. It's otherwise a typical film of its sort if several years more later it appears to have not been particularly prescient of the wonderful advances we've had since in the way of telling a story.

Its' a reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire, an amazingly clunky epic from the 60s around the same story that signaled the end of its type; in its narrative trajectory this is as stale now. The hero and villain, the conflict, the rising above circumstances and poetic redemption. The stage is of course far more dynamic, it's overall closer to the eye but frames the same one dimension.

Kingdom of Heaven was more evocative for me; there we started by following an ordinary man swept to a far and mysterious historic horizon, the journey was to a place where destiny threatened to reveal itself, though the film otherwise partook of many of the same faults as this, the blacksmith became the hero, the tentative horizon became the painting of brave exploits.

The nested story here is about the power of vision.

It's the vision Commodus creates to manipulate a mob addicted to empty spectacle, the gladiator-movie that we came to see, enough to forego our mundane worries about what's wrong with the state of things. We see the emperor place miniatures of gladiators in a replica of the arena and this is followed by a majestic aerial shot of tiny particles of people flushing towards the Colosseum for the movie.

Then it's the hero's vision of what he can achieve by agreeing to play his part in that spectacle, redemption. He does this by not entertaining, by showing mercy and challenging our demand for bloodshed, though only after this has been sated by protracted killing.

But does any of this does what it says? The answer for me is no. If it did along the lines it sets up, we'd leave this disgusted by the hollow spectacle and not secretly titillated, informed by the possibility of mercy for redemption and not glorying in the revenge.

No the only powerful thing here for me is the further nested vision of Maximus that gives him strength to keep going; the vision of loved ones.

Scott wisely discerned that this had to be bound to a tangible place, the lovely home in the Roman countryside, that it would be our visual tether as we strayed to the accidental world of organized cruelties. It's all anchored on this spot. The shot of his hand caressing the rippling wheat is on his way to meet them, imagined, at first as a much anticipated return from years of war, later as a reunion in the next world.

Scott could have done so much more to visually caress the place in mind but the fact that he places it at the center tells me he was wise to the power of vision and mind. Isn't the shot of the dirt road leading up to the house lined with cypress trees rippling in the wind one of the most memorable images here? Maximus description of the house to the emperor conjures the imagery the camera omits, earthy smells and textures.

Several magnitudes more powerful than any vindication in the arena, the power of this vision would be that of not losing sight of what makes us human, not letting the darkness of dungeons and arenas of life pull this anchor.",
18 April 2020,And now we are free. I will see you again... but not yet... not yet,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down.

I am not going to write a long comment to explain the shortcomings of this movie because they are so obvious. First of all, the movie was full of clich√©s and exaggerations. The plot really lacked originality. This was actually the ROMAN VERSION of BRAVE HEART or the latest version of BEN HUR rather than gladiator. I cannot understand why such a stale plot was used...

Secondly,, the visual effects were fairly poor, apart from being realistic. For instance the tiger was like a character of one of Disney's animations. It was obviously non-realistic.. And it was also too obvious that the upper part of the coliseum was computer-generated..

In the next place, the movie was unreasonably long; long enough to bore the audience. So, all Gladiator fans; please stop giving this poor movie more than it deserves. Since the production cost of this movie was high, some thought this was a great movie, who are fascinated by the fake beauty of gladiator!!! This is the unfortunate fact about gladiator.",1

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
20 August 2004,Eh,"""Gladiator"". What is there to say about the ""Braveheart"" wannabe? May I say that this movie is just too highly over rated. While there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching, I kept falling asleep. I don't understand what is the big deal about this movie. And Russel Crowe winning best actor for this? I don't get it.

Like I said, there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching. But after a while you'll want to throw yourself out the window after boring yourself. This movie can work for some, but as for me. Well, let's just say it I landed on the ground 5 times and am still standing.

1 December 2000,"USE YOUR MIND, NOT YOUR GLANDS: WATCH ""I, CLAUDIUS"" INSTEAD!","The biggest single indictment of this disatrous excuse for an epic is that the one truly great actor in the movie, Derek Jacobi, is (like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed) brought in to bring a whiff of authentic class (to hide the other whiffs), and, like the others, is quickly snuffed. Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS. That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test. Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals. Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY. If you want to be like the Romans and enjoy the sight of people being disemboweled and torn limb from limb, then by all means check this out. But, please, watch one of the classics instead and you'll quickly dump this pretender.

27 May 2000,What a mess!,"Ridley Scott is an relapsed. Since ""The Duelists"" he insists in put some cheap glamour on historical situations. The result is a complete mess of incorrect historical insights, kitsch images based on manneristic painters of the XIX century like Sir Lawrence Alma-Tedema and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. The dialogs are pure soap-opera: the kingdom of obvious bla, bla, bla. Some isolated efforts of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are responsible for the less camp moments of the movie. For a second time we assist The Fall of the Roman Empire. Now as a farce. As we said in Brazil: Que merda!!!

6 May 2000,A Colossal Disappointment!,"The ""coming attractions"" were more exciting and fun than watching ""Gladiator"" after them. I was all prepared for a movie of action, and romance and adventure. The kind of film that gets you caught up in the story, and has you rooting, cheering and clapping at the climax of the movie. This wasn't it. The story never drew me in, or gave me a reason to care what happened. I think Russell Crowe is a talented actor, but not in this... His acting consisted of variations on looking stern or solemn, with maybe three smiles thrown in to show his range. As for this moviegoer, I'd rather watch an old Steve Reeves movie.

22 December 2022,I was entertained,"I really like Roman history so this movie has been on my watchlist for a while now, and I was not let down by the end results. The buildup of the battles is phenomenal, the fight choreography is perfect and Russel Crowe and quakine phoenix give the performances of a lifetime. The blood/gore affects are also really good in this. But one of my few problems with the movie is how historically inaccurate it is. Like it's barely even based on true events. But that is only a small complaint for an otherwise phenomenal period pice/action movie

In conclusion, I would recommend this to anyone who likes historical epics (this is by far the best one)

30 March 2001,Plot goes haywire - power surges abound,"Gladiator overwhelmed the opposition in Academy voting this year. Yet those who cry ""foul"" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the ""second-place"" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films. This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot. Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits. I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of ""revisionist"" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained. Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue. For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be. Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.",10
25 February 2000,Gladiator will kick your ass!,"I saw Gladiator last night at a private screening in San Francisco and was totally blown away. Imagine Spartacus as directed by Akira Kurosawa. Imagine the chariot race in Ben Hur, then ratchet up the action and special effects. The ancient world is brought to life so believably, so beautifully, that you are free to follow the incredible action without distraction. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, the Roman general turned slave then gladiator - this performance will make him a Star. I won't spoil it for you by spilling the entire story - you get the idea - just go see Gladiator the moment it comes out, this is a classic.

26 October 2008,Brilliant,"Great action, story and acting. Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.

It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.)

The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.

There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.

9 March 2020,Great,"Gladiator is a more modern take on the sword and sandal Roman period epics like Ben Hur and Spartacus. With a big budget and Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator is high powered entertainment. Epic in scope with a huge cast and great f/x, this is a marvel to look at and was put together well. A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around. This is in my opinion one of Ridley Scott's finest works and like most of his films, stands the test of time and holds up really well.

28 March 2017,An epic film like no other,"Gladiator is a great experience to the film viewer. It is a beautiful and well told story that keeps you intrigued and at the edge of your seat from start to finish. A great cast, story, visual effects and soundtrack are the right ingredients for this iconic film.

The story is simply mesmerizing and beautifully told of a respected General who became a slave, who became a Gladiator, and, who then won the praise of many and defied the evil emperor. Just as the spectators in the Coliseum cheer for Maximus so does the viewer as you support his vengeance and justice. Justice against an evil Emperor who killed his family and wants to prevent a Rome governed by the people. The dream that was once Rome as envisioned by his great late father is pushed aside for his selfish wishes. The fights he organizes in the Coliseum are to distract the people as he knows too well that Rome is not the Emperor or the Senate but the mob. Little does he know that soon Maximus will return as a Gladiator to defy him and win the praise of the mob.

The final moments are simply masterful. The scene showing Gladiator about to be reunited with his wife and son in the next life and him reaching out to this before he falls is probably one of the best scenes in film history. The soundtrack is simply epic and transports you easily to a time when Gladiators battled in ancient Rome. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his work and it works perfectly with some great scenes.

Russell Crowe's Gladiator won the hearts of many in the film as I am sure this film won the hearts of many of its viewers.",9
24 April 2017,Now THIS is a best picture!,"Gladiator really is one of the greatest films ever made! It has everything that a movie like this needs to have in order to be successful. It has an amazing cast of talented actors that nail their characters and give marvelous performances. It has impeccable set design and costumes that creates the time and place in which the entire movie takes place. It has a script that is so well written that you will never become bored or wish that the movie would hurry up. When you combine all of these things together how could the film not turn out to be the winner of five academy awards and become one of the top rated movies ever. The acting first of all. Russel Crowe is amazing as Maximus, he gives such a focused, raw, intense performance that will without a doubt move you to tears. Phoenix is also great here, very evil dedicated character that will do anything, basically there are no limits to his wickedness and Phoenix plays it all so well. So all in all the acting is out of this world great. The story is very well put together and it has the appropriate emotional ties built into it so that the audience is pulled in and they care about the characters and what happens to them. The combat sequences are very very well filmed, I was impressed by the quality of those scenes in particular. The sets and costumes and just about anything technical is all very intricate and done with careful attention to detail. 10/10 for Gladiator! And I adored the ending by the way, how touching and what a right way to wrap things up.",10

2 May 2002,Better After Repeat Viewings,"At first, I thought Gladiator was a fairly undeserving Oscar Winner. But after seeing it a few more times afterward, I began to realize how amazing this film really is. From the very first shot in the wheat to the last shot, Gladiator has a visual power which hasn't been experienced for quite some time. Russell Crowe has also fallen into the type of actor where he is excellent in any role he takes, not matter how bad the film is. I'll be enjoying this film for years to come.

6 June 2001,There have been much better films on this theme,"Firstly, I was able to tell what was going to happen from one scene to the next. no suspense or real drama Next: The poorest use of CGI - I cant believe that I was able to spot all the computer effects (crowd scenes mainly & the entry to Rome. How this one any academy awards is beyond me.This is 2 years in a row that an an undeserving Dreamworks film won an oscar. I cant believe everyone is so in awe of Spielburg they honor anything he is associated with. For better movies of about a Gladiator Or this period of time see

SPARTACUS OR THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE OR EVE QUO VADIS Fall of the Roman Empire was not that great a film but it sure surpasses this mess. & believe or not was more truthful in the story of the Emperor Commodus & Marcus Aurelius. Commodus was a trained expert wrestler & fought many times in the games, obviously he always won, except the final time. Besides having a yen for his sister he liked the boys also & that was completely left out.

7 August 2023,Top 5 of All time,"One of the best movies ever.

The acting is award level, and the storyline is just incredible. Not many movies like this anymore where it keeps you watching the entire time with many shocking moments and the cinematography is really quite well done for the time it was made.

It's a 10/10 because you can rewatch this over and over again and still be enthralled by what this movie brings.

Easily one of Russels best movies he's ever done and they really need to make more movies like this these days. I've never seen a movie that makes you angry, sad, happy at the same time. Absolutely incredible film I'd recommend to anyone.

27 September 2015,"Overrated and Over-hyped, but Not Bad","""Gladiator"" is a good movie. I, personally, didn't think it was GREAT or PERFECT at all, but I still liked and appreciated the film for what it was. An epic action film! There are some great, awe- inspiring moments and battle scenes that really impressed me. You can tell that, on a technical level, a lot of talent was involved with this project, and Hans Zimmer's score only enhances the epic feeling! Plus, the ending is genuinely powerful, and I cared for the characters.

However, when there isn't some grand spectacle of a battle sequence happening, a lot of the film felt a bit bland. Not EVERYTHING that wasn't an action sequence, just a lot of it. It also is a bit predictable and clich√©d at times.

Overall, ""Gladiator"" isn't a masterpiece script-wise, but more of a masterpiece on a technical level.

11 July 2007,A great epic...,"Gladiator (2000)

Number 3 - 2000

Not only is it filled with bloody and visually stunning battle sequences, but it has an emotional backing behind it. That is what makes Gladiator the film that it is. That is why it won Best Picture. It isn't just a meaningless 3 hour bloodbath, it is a breathtaking, epic film that has Russell Crowe avenging the Roman Empire for slaying his family.

Russell Crowe is on top form, in an engaging, Oscar grabbing performance that echoed across the film industry.

Ridley Scott's epic is a classic story of 'good versus evil', about justice and vengeance packaged in the form of magnificent entertainment.

30 June 2009,The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor.,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" tells the story of a betrayed Roman general (Russell Crowe) who is thrust into the life of a gladiator. He lives for the day that he can exact revenge on the man responsible for the murder of his wife and child, the emperor himself (Joaquin Phoenix).

The film harks back to the sort of big-budget historical epics that died out in the mid-sixties. Therefore, it isn't surprising that the script's strength isn't originality. The plot borrows elements of ""Ben-Hur"" & ""Spartacus"" and supposedly also draws heavily from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", which I haven't seen.

Regardless of this lack of originality, the film does manage to present us with a compelling story of a type that had been absent from movie screens for too long. Also, with the advances in CGI, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the epic scope that such a story deserves. While the script may misstep a few times it nevertheless presents an intelligent story effectively balancing action and political intrigue.

The cast is solid. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his work here, which is a bit surprising to me. It's a good performance as far as action-oriented drama goes, but I don't think that it's outstanding by any means. I think that Joaquin Phoenix fared better as the conniving emperor but he only managed an Oscar nomination among some tough competition. The rest of the cast is generally above-average, featuring a number of talented individuals like Djimon Hounsou & Richard Harris.

Ridley Scott's direction is skillfully handled and resulted in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The attractive cinematography & crisp editing were also recognized with Oscar nominations. The visual effects deservedly won an Oscar, as did the costume design, while the art direction scored another Oscar nomination. These plaudits should make it clear that this is a film showing considerable care in all areas of visual presentation.

A further Oscar nomination resulted from Hans Zimmer's score while the sound design scored another Oscar win. Very rarely do I notice sound design in a film but in this case I did.

I'd say that, more than anything, the high quality of every technical aspect of the film went a long way in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar win. As for my own opinion, I think that the film represents a rare commodity: A crowd-pleasing film that also shows considerable technical prowess.",8
19 September 2022,Large scale but intimate,"I normally admire movies like this when well made but I am seldom moved by them . Gladiator has heart and soul as well as action and the big themes of right and wrong, fairness and justice and dignity for all no matter what your station in life is.

Films about Ancient Rome are often intriguing for the ruthlessness and backstabbing and changing loyalties . Making money is often above doing what is right it's also about survival. Gladiator has all that but also feels like a smaller more intimate film . Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe achieve the near impossible and we remember the heartfelt moments as much as we remember the battles and the treachery. Are you not entertained?

6 March 2009,Unleashing Helle.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8
14 January 2001,I can't join the crowd,"I guess this is a fun movie if you like to watch well-acted, non-stop carnage and torture for whatever the (long) length of the movie is. I'd rather watch pretty much anything else. As far as it goes Russell Crowe is okay as the hero, a disfavored general making an anonymous(!!) comeback as a gladiator. Best portion of the film is the beginning, where Crowe takes on German tribesmen with his Roman legion. That that portion is the easiest to stomach is a comment on the rest of the movie. Enjoy.

15 May 2000,"Predictable, long, loud, bloody","That about describes the movie...the plot is by the number, the movie is too long by about 1/2 hour, it's needlessly loud and it's very bloody (which is to be expected). The only real reasons to see the film: Crowe's great performance (and body) even if he does slip into his Australian accent ocassionally and director Scott's incredible visuals. Also worth seeing is Oliver Reeds' final performance (he's very good). All the other acting is OK, but the story is just so drawn out and I was always one step ahead of it. The fight scenes are incredible, but those sequences don't make up for the rest of the movie. Wait for the video.

24 February 2001,"Imperfect, but engaging and entertaining","Gladiator strives to be more then a brainless big-budget action movie, in that sense, it deserves credit. The question is, though, does Gladiator actually manage to do this?

In a way, yes. The storyline, while fairly linear and lacking a huge amount of complexity, manages to give proper motivation to each character and it flows smoothly. There never is any doubt what a character is doing in any given scene. The characters are even well-defined, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of its ilk.

However, Gladiator does have its problems. There is no joy, and little emotion to this movie. Everyone who is in this movie is either vengeful, depressed, angry, or just plain said. It's a rather cold movie, in that way... compared to its fellow Best Picture nominee Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which exudes warmth and emotion), Gladiator is extremely cold and joyless. While the storyline does do a good job of saying why everyone acts like this, it still doesnt help the fact that the movie is extremely cold. Im not asking for a tacked-on love story, just a little bit more emotion then anger or depression.

Still, that aside, the movie does manage to stay entertaining. Some parts dont seem to flow quite well, but, for the most part, it is good. The many facets of what is going on (for example, Commodus' dealings with the Senate) are well represented, and Ridley Scott manages to do a good job of sticking with these topics and dealing with them.

Gladiator has its fair share of special effects, and they are very nice. Fitting in with the theme of the movie, however, much of it is filmed in drab earth tones. The early scenes are extremely blue or red, but never in between. Compared to a movie like ""Titus"" (to be fair, that movie only kinda-sorta takes place in Rome, but I digress), Gladiator is quite dull looking. Still, most of it does fit - the Colosseums look as one would think, as does everything else. But the movie definitely is not vivid, nor beautiful to look at. But it does look nice. A lot of the camerawork is good, but a special point must be made about some battle sequences (both the opening, and some effects used in the gladiator battles). There is just too much herky-jerky effects... enough to distract one from the actual event. In Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, the camera moved around a lot, to be sure, but at least one still got a good feel for what is going on. With this movie, the cameraman fell so in love with these techniques that he neglected that people would actually want to know whats going on.

Still, in spite of these flaws (some more significant then others), Gladiator is a very good movie. It is entertaining (although it does get boring at parts) and it does tell a good tale. However, compared to a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the two movies do have a lot of similar elements), Gladiator does come out as being the inferior one. But, that doesnt mean it's a bad movie - in fact, its probably worth a spot in a movie fan's collection.",7
7 May 2000,"Try an ""Our Gang"" or ""Little Rascals"" comedy instead...","This was one of the worst films that I have seen in quite a while. Each of the major characters is almost completely unbelievable, especially Crowe's Maximus. You would get a better history lesson, a higher art, and more entertainment watching Spanky, Alfalfa and ""Our Gang"" do a rendition of Julius Caesar or something. ""Gladiator"" was so boring and bad that it did not even elicit any unintentional laughs. But you may groan in agony waiting for it all to end. No surprises, no titillation (something we have a right to expect from the decadence of ancient Rome), no effective moral lessons, no revolutionary film making. Fans of extremely violent video games might get a thrill or two, but that's it. Testosterone addicts who desire to commit violence against others and feel completely justified in doing so might relate to the protagonists in this film. I don't. It stinks. I gave it a ""1"".

29 January 2001,Empire Intrigue,"I saw Gladiator this weekend and I have to say I'm not sure what all the hype was about. The story is only fair and the characters flat; and, at over two and a half hours, there was ample time for much better story and character development. Unlike Braveheart, and The Patriot, two other recent period epics, I was never drawn into the story, never became involved emotionally with the characters, never really cared. And, Crowe seems to play the same character in many of his movies; it's time for less grunting. It was nice to see Richard Harris, I wish he'd do more.

If you see it, see it for the scenery and the special effects; they are FANTASTIC. I remember watching Titanic and being able to pick out the people and scenery that was computer generated. Not so in Gladiator. Rome looks like it's real, nothing short of amazing.

The blood and gore, if you worry about that kind of thing, wasn't as bad as some have said; in fact, there was much less than I expected.

Worth the time if you must. But ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was better.",5
13 August 2021,Great historical - ish action movie,"""My name is Gladiator"" (with Australian accent) - just as i imagined it 180 a.d. In Rome.

Jokes aside, the movie is great! Swords, armor, blood splashing, chopping heads and beatuful women. Phoenix and Crow are both excellent. What more do you need a saturday night?

5 April 2007,"Not in the league of ""Spartacus"", though well worth-seeing...","Russell Crowe won a Best Actor Oscar for his taut performance as Maximus, hailed general of battle in 180 A.D. Rome who soon becomes a fugitive and warrior-slave after the Emperor dies and his ambitious, wicked son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes command. Director Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal, blood-and-guts spectacular isn't anything original, yet it certainly looks good and has many moments of power and emotion. Scott tries for the sweep of a latter-day ""Spartacus"", but the script isn't as intriguing and the film, while entertaining on the whole, isn't as memorable. Dedicated to actor Oliver Reed (Proximo), who makes his final film appearance, this Oscar winner for Best Picture has old-fashioned ideals transposed after the new-fangled violence, with lots of bloody action to snare modern moviegoers; it works successfully enough, and Scott efficiently uses the long running-time to build character and dramatic tension. **1/2 from ****

6 March 2019,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

""The General who became a Slave. The Slave who became a Gladiator. The Gladiator who defied an Emperor."" - And so begins one of the best onscreen epics to ever be filmed, featuring Russell Crowe as Maximus - the Gladiator.

When a dying king chooses his General, Maximus, as the next ruler of Rome over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the king is betrayed and killed by Commodus in a fit of self-pity and rage. Commodus then arranges to have both Maximus and his family killed so that he can usurp the throne. However, Maximus survives and is taken into custody as a slave and then turned into a Gladiator known only as the Spaniard. As fate would have it, his group of Gladiators find their way into Rome where Commodus has opened the Colosseum for 150 days of games - leading to the much anticipated and climatic final confrontation between the Emperor and the Gladiator who defied him.

This is such a good movie. The cinematography was excellent, that coupled with the amazing soundtrack really pull you in. The story is very well crafted and acted with great skill. It is tragic, yet exhilarating - taking us to a good payoff at the end. This is a perfect film, in my opinion, with very little room (if any) for improvement. This is what movie magic is all about. A very high recommend.",10

9 April 2017,A Modern Masterpiece.,"""Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."" The most famous dialogue from the movie. This dialogue is the whole plot of the movie.

Ridley Scott did an amazing job with this History drama. Gladiator is a very famous name among the common film lovers. I don't think there are any film passionate who are not seen the film yet.

The movie has great courtesy to the iconic classic epic films. The set decoration, lighting, scenario etc reminds of those gems of yesteryear. Yet, Ridley Scott has his signature in the movie. A very emotional, thrilling action drama. All the technical elements added flavor to the cinema. Cinematography, Editing, Music, Costume and all the aspects were in perfection, neck to neck.

The movie was Oscar nominated in 12 categories, winning 5 including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role.

A really worth watch. Do not miss this movie.

23 June 2001,Great Acting,"What can I say? Gladiator was a great film. It cunningly blends political satire, acting, action, and fun into to a film, right? WRONG.

Gladiator is more than just a fun-filled, oscar-winning, controversial action-fest. If you look below the surface, Gladiator has many facets of itself that makes a step above the rest.

First, compliments to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (who was wrongly denied the Supporting Actor Oscar.) One of the best examples of why this film is unusual is because of how varied and developed (or fleshed-out) the characters are.

Another important thing to remember is that the film is not necessarily meant to be taken as a pinnacle masterpiece of the ages. Though the film is portrayed quite artistically and has the ability to touch the audience on an emotional level, some scenes are just intended for fun (or shock value, whichever suits you best.)

And so, though I haven't much to say for this one, I enjoyed, and its one that will make a small impression on the American public (emotionally, not economically.)",
4 August 2008,Rote Revenge Pic Poses as Historical Epic,"""Gladiator"", winner of the Best Picture Academy Award in 2001, is less a historical epic of swords, sandals, and the fate of a mighty empire, and more of a bloated B-movie about a guy with a gloomy face seeking revenge for the murder of his family. ""Death Wish"" in Ancient Rome, if you will.

Thanks to director Ridley Scott it's a very pretty picture to look at: the icy blue light of a wintry Germanic battlefield, the amber hue of the emperor's throne room, and the Coliseum littered with rose petals like confetti. The many gruesome gladiatorial fight scenes are frenetically paced, visceral if not actually coherent. Some of the modern special effects, however, like the CGI cityscapes, look a bit crude, even by 1999's standards.

The script, like most of the scripts that Ridley Scott works from, is strictly rough-draft material. The characters are shallow, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the story tries too hard to intertwine the drama of the Roman political arena with the action of the hero's central journey in the more literal arena -- the former scenes only serve as breathing room between the latter scenes, which are the real meat of the film. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make the most out of their limited roles -- Crowe's terse delivery and brooding eyes establish his character better than the writer ever could -- but veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed nearly vanish into parts that ask too little of their great talents.

In the end it doesn't feel like a proper epic: it's not the sort of epoch-defining story that spans years and continents and a huge historical canvas, like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"" were -- or Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" which told essentially the same story in 1964. It's not even ""Braveheart"", another gory, overblown revenge flick. It's trying to be big and important, but it has nothing important to say; its only purpose is to construct a framework for swordfights.",6

Action scenes are impressive and well choreographed, CGI created incredible scenery, and Crowe and Phoenix fit their characters perfectly. But it wasn't the perfect film, and I can't put my finger on why. Gladiator should be seen by everyone, and everyone needs to make their own decision.

2 June 2000,"A bad movie, but not a lousy one","Well this film had much to offer. Absolutely nothing! I can understand why Mr. Scott is rated amongst bad directors. This film doesn't help him any more. But for the mainstream audience this film has got to be the best movie in years. The main stream audience is known for easily passing films like this one, as great. People say: Wow, look at the battle scenes in the beginning of the movie. To me it looks like just another battle scene. How can you differ one battle scene from another. It's difficult. If you people out there, wants to see great battle scenes, take a look at the movie ""War and Peace"". It has about 200,000 extras, and the scenes there, are much, much better than the one in Gladiator.

22 November 2000,"""Gladiator"" has it all...almost.","From cast to cinematography to wardrobe to sets to effects to just about everything else, ""Gladiator"" has it all. But, try as it may, the film fails to connect on the human level. What could have been a powerful epic which clearly defined the undercurrents of good and evil responsible the climate of political unrest and upheaval in Rome instead takes a simplistic ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy"" approach, gets too involved in it's own grandeur, and substitutes action for story telling with the likely result of a disconnected audience which will not feel the empathy and emotion such a film should command. Nonetheless, it's worth a watch even at 2.5+ hours.

24 July 2006,One word...Spectacular!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
14 May 2000,Where's the Roman bath?,"Except for the combat scenes, Gladiator is really lame. It took 3 writers, including director Ridley Scott, and the plot still has all the tension of a busted rubber band. You know the picture's in trouble when Hans Zimmer's soupy score has to be playing 99.9% of the time. Principal characters like emperor Commodus and his sister stand around pouting and plotting what to do next and relapse into animal fables on the meaning of power. Yawn! And here's where the film makers really missed the

boat: with a hunk like Russell Crowe as star, they didn't contrive one scene in a Roman bath! You'd think a slave who becomes a sensation overnight would be treated to a Roman bath! But, then again, the film itself takes a bath.

1 March 2003,Total Trash.,"I don't care what anybody else thinks this movie was a total bore, I almost fell asleep during this film, also Russel Crowe did not deserve best actor for this movie, it must of been a fix, personally I think everybody in Hollywood must be Mad to give an Oscar to such a Dick of an actor.

I cant believe the fuss everyone makes over this poor excuse of a movie, I would choose to watch a cooking show Or static over this Pitterful film any day.

1 July 2003,Best Picture? You gotta be kidding!!,"I cannot understand how this truly lousy movie won best picture of the year. It never ceases to amaze me how current directors and producers continue to regurgitate good movies from the past into the current excrement that stinks up movie screens today. Ridley Scott doesn't even know how to frame a scene of sweeping spectacle. He may as well have been doing a TV commercial. They obviously spent millions on scenery but he never showed what they built. Whereas Martin Scorsese can make a few million spent on a set look like a billion dollars--Gangs of New York, Age of Innocence, New York, New York. Joaquin Phoenix is more campy than Joan Collins at her campiest.

7 July 2016,"Great action and a great technical aspect, but I did not care for any of the characters","Gladiator was one of the films I grew up with as a kid. However, as I grew older, I stopped watching it, and I've gone several years without watching it. I wanted to check it out to see if I would still like it as much as I did when I was younger. When I finally re-watched it after all these years, I felt like it didn't hold up. Its fighting and technical aspects were very good, but I could not care about Maximus's character.

After a Roman general named Maximus is about to become Emperor of Rome, he is betrayed by his brother named Commodus who murders his family. He is forced into slavery where he comes back as a Gladiator and fights his way up to seek his revenge.

The action is definitely the highlight of this film. I think that it's really good. The fights aren't choreographed all too well since they have shaky cam, but I think the fights were shot that way on purpose to show how Gladiators fought by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every time a character gets stabbed, you feel the pain as the stab always feels very realistic without ever feeling over-the-top or ridiculous. The Coliseum looks realistic, and it gave the fights a claustrophobic feeling. During one fighting sequence, they were reenacting ""The Battle of Zama"". A large number of Gladiators were in the middle of the Coliseum and they were surrounded by enemies in chariots. Shortly after the battle started, a few Gladiators were quickly killed off, and it gave the fighting a lot of tension after the viewer learned how much of a disadvantage Maximus had. That was my favorite fight scene in the film.

Considering that Ridley Scott is usually pretty good with cinematography (Blade Runner and Black Hawk Down), I had no concern about the cinematography, and I expected it to be really good. I was right. The city of Rome was perfectly captured in the film. Many tableau's of Rome and the Coliseum were beautiful to look at. Rome looked vast, majestic, and full of people. Even the CGI shots were impressive and blended into the film seamlessly. They hold up pretty well today. The only issue I have with the film on a technical level was with its soundtrack that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Some songs felt like they were ripped off of by many other action films. Especially the parts where it sounded like someone was singing in a different language. I've heard that in many other films before and it's starting to feel a bit unoriginal. Other than that, the film worked pretty well from a technical standpoint.

I don't think that Russell Crowe should've won an Oscar. His performance wasn't bad. Crowe himself is fine. However, his role is about as basic as you can get for a tough guy role. Any actor with some talent could've done what he did. Speaking of Maximus's character, I could not care for him at all. He's just dour and dull for the entire film, even before his family is killed off. He's bland and unsympathetic from the get-go, and he only gets more revenge filled as the movie continues on. I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I could not care for his character for that reason. I could not care about any of the other protagonists in the film. When a main character died, I didn't care that much for them as I felt like I had just been introduced to them. Their deaths just sort of came and went by. Also, I was not as moved by its ending as I expected I would be before going into this film.

Looking around a bit, I've seen several reviewers bring up that its plot of betrayal and revenge has been done to death. If I felt that way, I would most likely have a bigger issue with sympathizing with Maximus. As of now, however, I can't think of any movies which borrowed its plot line that came out before this one was released, and I have yet to see any reviewers name any films with a similar plot as this one. So, until I do, I'm going to put that criticism aside.

In conclusion, I wasn't a fan of this movie. It's a real shame, because I was hoping that I could relive my childhood memories of it. I can appreciate it for impressing me with its action and its technical aspect. The action was definitely the highlight of the film, and Rome was also very beautiful to look at. However, much of it seemed wasted since it failed in the most important area: Its characters. Maximus felt like a very generic shell of a character and he seemed very uninteresting. I will always love Ridley Scott though, even though I disliked one of his most popular films.",4
3 July 2020,Amazing,"The Gladiator is a phenomenal movie. Beautiful directing, powerful acting and some amazing dialogs.

5 January 2023,"6.7/10 - Yeah, Quite Entertaining","""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!""

Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, is a historical-fiction/drama film that takes place in the Roman Empire. It follows Maximus (Russell Crowe), once a general of a Roman legion, and now a slave who fights for entertainment as a gladiator in the arena. Even as a slave, he doesn't break and he yearns for one thing - getting his sword right to the throat of Commodus (Joaqin Phoenix), the emperor who destroyed his life.

This movie is considered a classic by many, a masterpiece by some, and I gotta say - it's quite hard for me to see why exactly it's like that.

I mean, I like some aspects of the film, sure. It has some cool shots, Crowe and Phoenix give solid performances, several fight scenes are kinda badass. Alright. But everything just feels so...I don't know, like a Hollywood clich√©? It doesn't feel special in any way, shape or form.

Let's focus on Crowe and Phoenix for a moment - their characters have an interesting dynamic, one a stoic hero with natural charisma and a solid set of principles, while the other is a lonely, deceptive man-child with troubled mind and a lack of social skills. As I said, performances are solid and (as you probably know already) these actors act well. But yet, I have no strong feelings about them at all. Yeah, I want to know what happens next when their plans collide and they have this struggle of sorts, but it's nothing more than a mild interest. Things never feel unique, captivating, creative.

To be honest, I think that ultimately this is my problem with reviewing this film - I have very little to say cause the film just doesn't invoke more than an occasional feeling of mild interest or disgust or joy in me. Scattered moments with no consistency, yeah, but this film is not bad either. It doesn't have any element that I think is horribly executed. It's fine, it's okay, it's even kind of enjoyable. Despite being so Hollywoodish it's still, for a lack of a better word, entertaining.

So yes Maximus, I was, in fact, entertained. Not as much as I could've been, and I was definitely not very immersed in the film, but I still feel like it wasn't such a bad time. Directing is not bad, plenty of cool fight scenes, some quotable lines and badass moments here and there. Way too clich√© to be a masterpiece, a classic or even have much of a rewatch value for me, but it's not a bad movie at all. I'm feeling a 6.7/10 on this one.",6
10 December 2005,An epic masterpiece. One of the greatest films of all time...,"An aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) has decided not to leave the empire of Rome in the hands to his only son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and instead has decided to leave it to Rome's greatest General and his greatest friend Maximus (Russell Crowe). Forced to make a decision by morning, Maximus sleeps on the idea while Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his son who does not take it well and kills his father in his anger.

Maximus wakes up in the morning to hearing the news of the Emperor's death, the only one knowing who the true successor was supposed to be and with an accurate assumption of who killed the Emperor. Refusing to pledge his allegiance to Commodus, Maximus is sentenced to death and escapes and journeys to save his family, only to find them all dead. With nothing left to loose, he lives his new life as a gladiator called The Spaniard, taking his vengeance on other gladiators.

This is one of the greatest epic stories told on film. The idea of a man with nothing to loose has intrigued audiences for years but not since Russell Crowe have they witnessed the barbaric violence of a roman gladiator. Crowe plays the greatest gladiator I could have ever imagined and Joaquin Phoenix is one the greatest, most complicated villain ever shown on film.

The action is incredible. Not since Braveheart, has there been such wonderful battles and fight sequences. From beheadings to throat slits, Gladiator does not hesitate to show the gory realism of the roman Coliseum. Breathtaking surroundings bring Rome to life though eloquent displays of architecture and the large quantities of people, quenching their thirst for the mindless violence shown in the roman arena. This as well as the wonderful writing and incredible acting bring Rome to life as well as creating a story that could entertain anyone.

Gladiator is so inspiring and entertaining that I could watch it daily and still find myself still feeling as strongly as I feel about it now. The film is flawless in every aspect. Ridley Scott makes his greatest film of all time, surpassing Blade Runner and Alien. Overall, Gladiator succeeds in every aspect and is one of the greatest films of all time.",10
7 June 2001,Where was Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson???...Russell Crowe's gaze could melt an iceberg...,"While viewing GLADIATOR and seeing how the ""revenge"" theme was carried to the fullest, I kept expecting to see Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson riding in on their horses to avenge the killing of Russell Crowe's family as they did in so many westerns.

I have to give the film itself a mixed review--and mostly for technical reasons. First, I thought the performances were all splendid. Russell Crowe's intent gaze could melt an iceberg and he uses this intensity to add power to his portrayal. Believe me, it works. Joaquin Phoenix is so good that he should have won the Supporting Role Oscar for his work. He was spine-chilling as the villainous Commodus, pitted against his arch enemy Maximus. Great acting by both men. The battle scenes were excessively gory with buckets of blood gushing everywhere--on a grand scale befitting an epic but perhaps an indication that today's sensibilities are more than blurred.

On the technical side, I don't understand all these comments about the photography. The color took on a distinctly murky look for much of the film, both interiors and exteriors. It made me wonder what kind of color stock was being used to get this muddy effect. Was it intentional? Take a look at the technicolor epics of the '40s and '50s where there was such great color contrast and brilliance in the color. I was very disappointed in the color photography. No need for it to be so dark. Perhaps on a large theater screen this wasn't as much a fault.

Another thing--much of the dialog was muttered in soft tones that could not overcome the background music. A good dialog director should have coached the players to enunciate words more clearly. This is a fault that occurs throughout the film and is very distracting--and no, I'm not hard of hearing at all, thank you.

Aside from those two quibbles, length was another factor that should have been solved with better editing. There are dull stretches where the dialog goes on much too long to make a point about character development.

Definitely not a perfect film and not particularly Oscar worthy although I'm impressed by the performances. While SPARTACUS was a much more interesting look at gladiators, perhaps GLADIATOR was meant to be the thinking man's film about Ancient Rome. It just misses the mark.

Russell Crowe's intense style of acting and Joaquin Phoenix's strikingly vivid villain made GLADIATOR work for me.",
11 July 2001,I am GLAD I saw this one,"When I saw Gladiator, I was reminded of Braveheart. But you know what? That's actually a really good thing, seeming as I loved Braveheart. Gladiator is good on all scales. Visually, it is probably the best film of the year. Story, one of the top five. Acting, one of the top five. Gladiator leaves on the edge of your seat the whole time. What's amazing about this is you don't see many action movies that debate between systems of government, and this movie handles it so well. This is brilliant film making, it just might be better than Braveheart. So if you liked Braveheart, you'll LOVE this.

24 February 2001,"stupid, boring crap","This is essentially a combined remake of several movies that deal with the fall of the Roman empire (Spartacus, Fall of the R.E., Quo Vadis?). These movies were made 30+ years ago, so I guess in the obvious lack of ideas the producers thought it would be a great idea to redo the same freakin' material.

""Gladiator"" also draws obivious comparisons to ""Braveheart"" but ""Braveheart"" is a million times better movie. Or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Heck, ""Armageddon"" is better than this overrated piece of trash. Crowe's character's motivation is to avenge the death of his wife and son. But since we never see them, WHO CARES???!!

When you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, like I did, it's a good sign the movie sucks.

1 November 2000,Overrated,"I don't live in the States, so by the time Gladiator got here, I had a fair idea of what to expect - an impressive, well acted, well directed historical spectacle. And since Russell Crowe is had impressed me in the past, I went and saw it. About five minutes in I got a strange feeling that I'll end up disagreeing with the reviews.

Wow, did I ever. Let's start with the acting: inconsistent best describes it. Crowe was good, though not up to his L.A Confidential and Insider standard. Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed turned in decent performances as well. Joaquin Pheonix overacted a bit but for the most part I thought he did an okay job. Richard Harris was ridiculous and Connie Nielsen was very pretty, but calling what she did acting would be a stretch. The kid was very annoying.

Now, the other problems: Many sequences in the movie were so dark I couldn't see the actors' faces. Obviously not a good thing. Is this meant to convey the darkness of Maximus's predicament? The oppressiveness of the Roman Empire? The treachery of Commodus? I wonder...

Still, the biggest problem was the screenplay. A lot of the dialog was plain silly, and I spent much of the movie wondering what motivated some of the characters. The whole thing seemed horribly one dimensional and contrived.

Maybe it's just me? Well, I went with four friends, all of us with very different tastes. None of us enjoyed Gladiator, and I think my friend summed it up best when she said she was very impressed, but she doesn't think she liked it.

Despite my rather negative opinion, I'm going with a 5/10 on account of the movie's better performances and some nice cinematography. But as for Crowe films, I'll take L.A Confidential any day.",5
23 May 2006,Amazing movie,"Even after seeing it... god knows how many times. I still love this movie. It is my favorite movie anyways, or at least one of my favorites.

The movie just has a lot in it, from epic action scenes, like the opening battle, to really emotional scenes, this also is the only movie ever that made me cry, and i don't cry that easily. The actors in this movie are really skilled anyways (especially Russel Crow, it is one of his best movies in my opinion)

You also really believe you are there. They really gave it the correct feeling. They even build a colosseum just for shoot this movie (well.. 60% of a colosseum that is)

If you haven't seen it already, run to the nearest DVD dealer and buy it now!

If there is oppression, there will be resistance. The resistance crowd will always have a leader, and each person who acts as a leader has his own unique place.

25 March 2007,Djimon Hounsou Film Festival #2,"This film won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russel Crowe. To me, this is the film that defines Russel Crowe, much the way I believe Mel Gibson is defined by Braveheart. It had another 45 wins out of 75 nominations. It was obviously considered by many to be one of the most outstanding films of all time.

I would not repeat the description which is known by almost everyone, but say that I though Crowe was magnificent. I also thought that Djimon Hounsou established his cred as an actor for his role in this film. The supporting cast was outstanding and really added to my enjoyment.

Director Ridley Scott never let the film lag. The action was continuous and exciting. They just don't make movies like this very often.

13 November 2014,What was it like to be a gladiator?,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.

I saw ""Gladiator"" in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad‚Äînot at all‚Äîit's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch ""Gladiator"" without comparing it to 1960's ""Spartacus,"" the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and ""Gladiator"" is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).

Yet ""Gladiator"" has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.

Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.

While ""Gladiator"" has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.

As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.

Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts.

15 January 2006,Epic struggle,"Ridley Scott film Gladiator (2000), reputedly inspired by a painting, is set in ancient Rome at the time of Caesars (approximately 100-50 B.C.). Leaders of a republican empire that spread across the whole of Europe, most of the Middle East and North Africa, we join their premier General Maximus (Russel Crowe) on the battlefield immediately prior to their invasion of Germany.

Caesar himself (Richard Harris) is in old age. He is wondering whether this great empire he has conquered has been worth the sacrifices he has had to make to secure it.

It is not long before he finds out. His aptly named and disaffected son Commodos (Joaquim Phoenix) is soon hell-bent on winning control of all that his absent father has won. His unwilling sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) are drawn into a succession of outrageous betrayals which they feel helpless to avoid.

Loyal Maximus, meanwhile, suffers the loss of his family and barely escapes with his life. Tended to by Juba (Diimon Hounsou) and exiled, of necessity, to a remote part of the Empire - he rebuilds his shattered life championed by the unlikely promoter Proximo (Oliver Reed).

No longer the leader of a legitimate army, Maximus makes his name as a prize-fighter or Gladiator. Even in the time of ancient Rome, such a fighter could win his freedom from slavery by open competition in the public arena.

Returning to Rome as a self-made champion, Maximus is soon recognised by long-serving members of the Senate like Graccus (Derek Jacobi) with whom he conspires to free Rome from the tyrannous hold that Commodos has gained by deceit.

A powerful tale, well told and full of the dark uncertainty that attends such great events.",10
24 May 2017,Masterpiece,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10

29 June 2014,A True Epic! A Phenomenal Film!,"If you have never seen the movie Gladiator (2000) then you are missing out on one of the best epic films ever made. The movie lives up to all it's hype and I think it will be a film that people will love to watch for years to come. It's one of my all time favorite movies.

The cinematographers did an outstanding job as did the movie editors. The costuming and sets are impeccable. The cast could not have done finer at acting out each of their roles that they played so believably and beautifully well. The timing of the actors could not have been executed any better.

The story is so extraordinarily good that it will leave you as breathless as all the action going on. The fight scenes will have you on the edge-of-your-seat as the men battle to the death for victory.

The film's ending came as a surprise to me - so much better than I was ever imagining. It was the perfect ending to a perfect movie. Not a historically accurate film - but a great movie that will leave you thinking in the very end.

14 June 2019,Just watched the extended version,"I haven't watch this movie in many years, and I've got hands on an extended version, 2hs50min. Worth every minute! What a great movie. I'm sure everything's been said about it, so I won't way much more. Solid story and acting, there's nothing to complain in that matter! My favourite thing about it is the cinematography and production design. Everything looks so detailed and realistic in terms of scenery and costume design, it's amazing. Beautifully shoot. There's a lot of little facts I've read about gladiators referred in the movie, looks like there was a lot of research. Great sound too, even though some times felt a bit overused in certain scenes... One of the most hateful villain I've seen in movies! Definitely a classic!

31 May 2007,Worst movie ever?,"I got this DVD for Christmas one year and I cursed at my mom for buying it. The action scenes are so frenetic that they are unwatchable, the dialogue is so clich√©d and cheesy that I vomit in my mouth when I overhear my meat headed friends watching it. The special effects are lame (chariots have engines in them that explode?). If not for Alien I would think less of Ridley Scott, but maybe he needed a couple bucks or something. This is modern film-making at its worst, and one of the early signs of the current mess that is Hollywood. The double disc collectors set now serves as coasters in my room. But who knows, maybe there will be a sequel. What schlock. I'd rather watch romantic comedies.

28 April 2001,"Boring, overrated piece of garbage","Boring, boring, boring!!! When this film won Oscar's best picture award, I finally realised that mindless Hollywood entertaiment is all that people want; which made me really sad. This film is no Oscar material at all - it's just another one of those no-brain Hollywood blockbuster action movies. Russell Crowe did nothing more than using his grunts to win his way to the Oscar statuette. Gosh, I even remember being bored to the death by this shallow galore. The colloseum sequences are dry, and Joaquin Phoenix was not threatening enough as a villain. The characters are as flat as cardboxes and as interesting to watch as looking at the thermometer going up. When Commodus said to Maximus (gee, Maximus; what an original name) that he ravished his wife repeatedly, it was a point that the audiences should feel anger. But, instead of me feeling angry towards the bad guy, I let loose with a big, gaping yawn.

The victory of Gladiator at the Oscars only shows the current, sorry state of American filmmaking. Pathetic movies disguised with coating candy, like American Pie, Road Trip, and that Tom Green movie. Ridley Scott should stick to making his Alien flicks. So if you want a boring pile of action trash that happens to win Oscars, which it can have Van Damme as it's main lead and it wouldn't matter anyway, go and see Gladiator.

(PS: a better alternative would be ""Spartacus"" which is a way, way better film - trust me on this)",1
26 December 2013,Uneven and Pretentious,"Ouch. This was the first DVD I ever purchased, and the first I gave to the local thrift store.

First of all, I was subjected to Richard Harris all too much at the beginning, and what was that all about? How did that contribute to the film? Film is all about compression of characters and more-or-less smooth progression through the story. I'd have left the Richard Harris part on the cutting room floor. To present ""the wrong person is on the throne"" can be done very effectively in many other (shorter) ways.

Second of all, Joaquin Phoenix's character was wholly one-dimensional, the result of which was a uniformly downward-feeling mood. Think of Stephen Boyd in Wyler's Ben Hur. Of course, Gladiator was a kind of remake of that one, which was a remake of a really good one. I now better appreciate Francis X Bushman.

And what was the dog all about? I get all that Roman Valhalla stuff, but the execution was pretty corny, all dreamy and, can I say it, cheap. And let me digress - Richard Harris's part in Caviezel's Count of Monte Cristo might better have been left 60% on the cutting room floor. It gave the same problem, taking time and focus from the meat of the story.

Gladiator was a one-and-done for me.",3

2 December 2000,Worthless,"What a piece of cynical garbage from a once good film director. I found this film appalling on so many levels and it represents where the Hollywood blockbuster is going these days - mindless plots, one dimensional characters, bloated poorly executed special effects. I really don't know where to begin except if you really liked this movie, please see some more and maybe someday you'll know better.

What a waste of talent and my time.

7 February 2002,The best historic film I have ever seen,"In my opinion, Gladiator is one of the best films about the Roman Empire. Never have I seen such a good film because it combines both, entertainment and a high level of quality. I have seen it more than 3 times and the more I see it, the more I like it. But the best of it is the perfomance of Russell Crowe and the rest of the actors, moreover, Joaquin Phoenix is a wonderful villain. He should have won an Oscar for his brilliant perfomance. In few words, I recommend this film to everybody who likes history and entertainment.

27 October 2018,Masterclass,"Not only the absolute top production of Gladiator, but also Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix giving some of their best performances, make Gladiator to one of the few top movies that tell us stories of and in the times of the Roman Empire: Ben Hur (1959), The Robe (1953), Quo Vadis (1951) and The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) comes to mind.

This is certainly one of Ridley Scott's best and most ambitious work he has ever done. One of those movies that will never ever grow old.

10 August 2022,One of the best films ever made,"This film is everything. Its so impactful and emotional that it transcends beyond being just a movie. There is a reason why so many people hold this film so dear to them. The dialogue, costumes, sets, designs, story, characters, music, sound mixing, drama and action are all on point and work together harmoniously to make this film as good as it is. This film came out 22 years ago but its still just as watchable and timeless.

21 March 2003,"Powerful, outstanding and periodic take on Ancient Rome.","The new millenniums response to `Spartacus' and the more successful `Ben Hur' proves to match up to, if not outshine those films levels and raises the bar even further.

After the risible and derivative `Hannibal' Ridley Scott swiftly redeems himself with his stylish and impeccable direction in `Gladiator'. I've never been a big fan of his work (I think `Blade Runner' and `Alien' are among the most overrated movies of all time) but this proves to me that he is a good director. The cinematography is sheer brilliance and the recreation of the Colosseum is magnificent. The rest of the settings are indeed superb and the play of dark shade on Rome adds to the atmosphere. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive and accurately timed.

The acting standard is also very good and there are great performances all round. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he received. Jaoquin Phoenix is dark and moody, as the evil Emperor Commodus (seems a bit like a take-off of Nero). Connie Nielson gives a much needed, international break-through role.

The good thing is that `Gladiator' balances out drama with gruesome battles. There is enough blood here to please all `bloodsporting actioners' yet plenty of drama to enlighten the `cinematic elite'. So overall, Gladiator was well deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award and goes for enjoyable fiction instead boring facts and figures. 7.9/10.",9
3 August 2005,Now Thats what I call Screen Magic !,"I used to mumble ""Afterlife' a Joke"" till Gladiator happened. Now I start to wonder if my actions will in fact echo in my Afterlife ! Set in Ancient Rome, The Gladiator is everything spectacular that you can imagine about a movie of such epic proportions. Breathtaking visuals of the amphitheaters and of Rome itself will segue you into an ancient Roman realm. The grandeur of the ""games"" will just etch itself in your mind. And the afterlife concept and its depiction was really mind-blowing.

USP 1: Dialogue! The Dialogue is everything that can be. It is Awe-Inspiring. It is Heart-Rending. It sends your Pulse-Racing and your hackles springing. I have watched this movie a zillion times now and have memorized every bit of verbal legerdemain that it has to offer. It is clearly exemplary in buttressing the already superior climaxes.

USP 2: Russel Crowe - Welcoming you into a cesarean time , is a stubbled Russel Crowe breathtakingly wielding his sword first in battle as a reputed general ,then in the amphitheater as a slave and finally in the Collosuem as the Gladiator. Although the entire cast have a splendid acting performance, Crowe in particular is terrific. Makes it all the more challenging, as his character traverses a wide variety of emotions and situations. He also command a certain air of unnerving chivalry throughout the movie. His English accent goes really well with the movie and its resounding dialog.

USP 3 : Hans Zimmer - Soundtrack! Hmm! How many times has it resonated in my ears ! Its brings the Afterlife to ...well ...life. It sets a super cadence to which you would pound your feat , drool your way through Elysiums and colloseums , enliven your emotions and indulge your senses. You could rerun the entire movie in your head with the soundtrack alone ! The sound track for the most part has a tinge of ""Gregorian"" and fittingly so too.

USP 4 : Cinematography and Special Effects - Cinematography and Special effects are so outstanding, that without the aforementioned USP's the Colosseum scenes would have comprehensively eclipsed the rest of the movie. And the Academy certainly didn't disagree either. Of particular significance, is the portrayal of Afterlife which although is a complete human conception , tends to inculcate into the movie a sense of mysticism. This is exactly where the Cinematography is a huge success.

It was really pleasing to witness ""The Gladiator"" make all the big snatches at the Academy Awards even against such stern competition as ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brokovich"". The Gladiator doesn't fall short to make it to the established pedestals of movie making on any front. All in all, a ""Screen Magic""!",10
6 December 2008,"The ""Real"" Epic Movie!","Has anyone reading this comment seen the movie ""Epic Movie""? Do you think that ""Epic Movie"" is the best ""epic"" out there? No, it's not even an epic at all. Gladiator is a true definition of what an epic movie is about. There is action, romance, and surprises. They all add up to the word ""epic."" This film is about a general of the Roman Empire who was wrongfully arrested over the murder of the emperor, taken as a slave, and turned into on the best Roman gladiators ever. While he is out there in the Coliseum, he has to deal with the evil son of the murdered emperor. The acting is very good. Russell Crowe did a great job and I was impressed on Joaquin Phoenix's acting. Ridley Scott always had the ability, as a director, to make Oscar-worthy movies. I also give thumbs-ups to Hans Zimmer. He composed many great movies with Gladiator being amongst them. This movie was nominated for a grand total of a whopping 12 Oscars and won 5 of them including Best Picture. On a minus side, this movie has slow parts basically involving Commodus. Other than that, this movie is close to perfect. I rate this movie 9/10.

11 June 2000,A great big disappointment,"I found this film extremely disappointing. Maybe it is wrong to make comparisons but if put besides Ben Hur or Sparticus, this had a distinct lack of narrative power, interesting characters, heart or intellectual meaning. I personally did not care about Maximus ¬ñ a man with the minimus of personality ¬ñ or indeed about any of the barely sketched figures which people the film. I also found Ridley Scott's visual style contemptuous. He does not seem the least bit concerned about making images with meaning or power but merely illustrates the script with pretty, overly crowded pictures. Most of it looked like an expensive advert. I kept expecting the actors to climb into a bath and eat a flake, or a new model of car to drive by, or the gladiators to run round the stadium in adidas trainers! With the exception of Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, the actors (especially the wildly overrated Joachim Pheonix) were not up to the job, the script lurched from one meaningless event to another and the human interest was zero. I simply cannot understand why people have fallen for this drivel.

28 June 2003,Hollywood hits an all time low!,"Since when are action movies supposed to be boring? Because boring defines about 90% of this movie, and even the action scenes weren't that great. Ridley Scott has only directed one good movie: Alien. Everything else he has done can eat it.

It was a cool concept, but it could have been done much better; cut out half of the talking (the source of the boredom), use STEADY camera work during the action scenes, and don't rip off Hamlet in the end. Of course, then you would need a new scriptwriter, a new director. After all those changes, you would probably have a decent movie.

30 June 2001,"Dour, heavy-handed, depressing, unpleasant.","I hated this movie. It's all fighting, and heavy-handed, tendentious plotting that's telegraphed way in advance, and murdering and torturing etc... depressing as hell, and made worse by being constantly accompanied by bad pseudo-Bruckner music. I really can't understand at all why anybody would want to expend their effort making a movie like this or wreck hours of their time watching it (I certainly wish I hadn't). It's technically competent, sure, and doubtless cost lots of money and shows it... but the whole exercise just seemed utterly depressing and futile to me. I hated Thelma And Louise and G.I. Jane too. I guess I've pretty much given up on Ridley Scott... although I liked his earlier films, particularly Blade Runner.

6 February 2017,The best Best Picture winner so far of the 21st century,"When I invest in watching a movie, I want my money's worth and my time's worth. I give the directors and actors a fair shot, a benefit of the doubt even in those I'm skeptical of, and I want them to pull me in. I want them to astonish me. Take me into a world I don't know, and make it hit hard. Move my emotions.

Give me scenery, a stage of an ancient world, and perfect it so that I feel like I'm there. Then, give me a hero and a villain, give me an arc of the hero, and let me know their soul. Entertain me, but keep it smart.

As fictional as a world may be, or as fictional as a story may be based on a real world in this case, make the characters' motives and emotions as real, raw, relatable, and justified as in modern times, or any time for that matter, and make them believable through great acting. Suck me in to this world, and keep me engaged. Make me feel like I'm watching a great movie, deliver the drama and climaxes.

Gladiator is 100% pure movie. It's a spectacle. It gives you just about everything you can ask for in a film experience. It's a modern epic woven together in a way few films of the century have been.

""Are you not entertained?"" Maximus yells to the audience. Thanks, we are. This is a real movie. It's the best Best Picture winner of the 21st Century so far.

Only negative is: I just wished it had a better ending, but I've learned to accept it through the years.

Recommendation: It gets better on multiple watches. First time, the action and spectacle can be so overpowering that some stuff in language is missed, but multiple views reveal it to be classic status.

27 June 2001,A Must See.... but Braveheart was better,"This movie is one that must be seen. Full of action, great acting, screenplay, everything. I have seen the movie ""Braveheart"" and I find that this movie tends to copy too much of ""Braveheart"" and this is the only thing I dissaproved of in the movie. The Gladiator tries to act like Mel Gibson, look like Mel and talk like Mel (probably because they are from the same birthplace). But if you must have an actor that portrays too much of another actor, you might as well have that actor that is being portrayed in the movie instead of somebody else. The plot and theme of ""Gladiator"" is also like ""Braveheart"". let's face it, if you've seen ""Braveheart"" because that one came out before ""Gladiator"" then you know what ""Gladiator"" is all about. Even almost the ending of both movies are close to the same. I enjoyed ""Gladiator"" very much, I give it an 8 but too much of the same thing in two different movies is hard for me to get into.

10 January 2001,Absolutely Terrible,"I thought this film shows all that is wrong with film making at the moment, the story was really terrible, poor guy, doesn't want to fight anymore, oops, they kill his family, now I don't care about anything and I'm going to kill lots of people.

This film would have been great if it was released as a comedy, as I laughed quite a lot at the predictable, boring story. The relationship between the Caesar and his sister was just ludicrous, and the effects, although no doubt very expansive, were not really very good.

When I came out I didn't know whether to laugh or cry!

7 February 2002,Highly enjoyable hokum,"""Gladiator"" is hokum. Let's begin there. It's highly cheesy - but it's quality cheese. It's nice cheese. I like to eat this cheese.

The premise is absurdly simple - Maximus Meridus (Russell Crowe) loses his family and his command after refusing to pledge alliegance to the psychotic new Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) because Commodus is a loony and killed his own father to gain power, fearing (rightly) his dad was about to dissolve the role of Emperor. So he ends up being a gladiator and uses his skills to rise up and get a chance to wreak vengeance. So no points for plot and there a few historical inaccuracies but hey, it's Hollywood! We expect it..

It's the acting and conviction placed into the characters that helps move this movie upwards. Crowe is great - and hey he won an Oscar for his role here. Real sense of the gritty determination he has and check out his ""And I will have my vengeance - in this life or the next"" speech- fantastic fun. Joaquin Pheonix camps it up a little as Commodus and is devilishly enjoyable as the slimy, lecherous, cowardly ruler. Fun fun fun. All the other plays similarly play well here.

Ridley Scott puts enough energy into this movie to draw you in. Sure you can argue the battles are done with flashy fast moving camera work in a bid to distract you - there's some truth to that. So what? It looks nice. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have pretensions on being a highly morale and deep tale - it's a fun blockbuster! It's slick and well done. Maybe you can detract points for Zimmer's overly present musical score or the overly heavy imagery of wheat-fields etc. but in the end it doesn't matter. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have enough to make it one of my favourite movies but it does have more than enough to lift it above the general dross. A well deserved 7.8/10",7
30 May 2000,Overall:a pretty bad movie,"Overall:a pretty bad movie They have taken an ""OK"" story, with a bad script, flat characters, mediocre performers, and loaded it up with more violence than necessary and called it a ""Summer Blockbuster"". Give me a break. I was extremely disappointed, especially in the end. It was very predictable and not satisfying. Russell Crowe was alright. Connie Nielson was nothing special. Joaquin Phoenix wasn't that bad. Derek Jacobi gave one (of two) good performance. Djimon Hounsou was also pretty good. I think I enjoyed the popcorn more than anything else....

26 December 2000,Best Christmas present this year.,"My daughter bought me the video for Christmas, and we watched it on Christmas Day.

We all flinched, gasped, sighed and cried right to the very end. I fell in love, and my daughter, who is nine and a half and has almost 300 videos, said it was the best film she had ever seen.

I am one of those people who watches movies to be entertained, and this did it for me.

2 December 2008,Epic,"""Gladiator"" is one of those films for the ages, a film that defies expectations and becomes something legendary. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for Best Actor as a Roman general seeking revenge on the corrupt prince (Joaquin Phoenix) who murdered his family. While a simple revenge dominates the plot, it really gives director Ridley Scott a chance to re-imagine ancient Rome as it was before its historical downfall. His vision is astounding, with plenty of graphic battle sequences (many of which are enhanced by CGI), great acting, and all-around epic greatness. ""Gladiator"" is really sweeping entertainment of the first order. While I feel I can no longer pay to see Russell Crowe in a movie anymore, this was his greatest performance ever, with an Oscar win that was surely well-deserved.

9 May 2000,"Pretty good, but this overrated historical epic lacks heart.","""Gladiator"" has a lot to commend it: Awesome fight scenes in the Coliseum, haunting images, and fine (albeit brief) supporting turns by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi. But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like ""Spartacus"" and even ""Quo Vadis"". And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope. Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 ""Cleopatra"". Maybe the latter film wasn't all that great either, but it captured the scale and pagentry that ""Gladiator"" misses.

31 May 2017,Ben Hur did it so much better.,"The positives: the film looks fantastic. The set and costume design is top notch and the cinematography is spectacular.

The negative (one big one): I've seen this story done already, much better, in Ben Hur. It's the same ""You betrayed me and sent me into exile, but I'm back and ready to kill you,"" story, but in this version I didn't care about any of the characters. Maybe it's because I don't find Russell Crowe's acting style compelling or maybe the characters are genuinely underwritten, but I just didn't care about what happened. My advice is to just watch Ben Hur instead. At least you get a cool chariot race there.

6 January 2001,"Gripping tale of honor, betrayal, and vengeance.","Stunning visuals, CGI, and wonderful performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harrison combine to make this film a delight to experience. My only complaint is that Crowe's ""General Maximus"" comes off as a bit too much of an innocent for his lofty position as a commander of legions of men. Crowe manages, in spite of this, to make you believe Maximus is a commanding man, a true leader. Ridley Scott certainly cast the best man for the job. Joaquin Phoenix made me emotionally squirm in my seat every time he came on the screen. His depiction of the nearly sociopathic son of the Emperor is a role he is clearly well capable of playing. Richard Harrison is always a delight to see, as is Oliver Reed.

7 July 2000,An overrated mess.,"Aside from Russell Crowe's strong performance, GLADIATOR is a chaotic mess. The editing is jumbled and confused, especially in the Arena scenes. To say this confusion is ""realistic"" is absurd, since when facing an opponent in the Arena, the most important thing is to remain clearheaded and outmaneuver him if you are to win. The celebrated battle in the forest in the beginning is just a silly attempt to ape the D-Day segment in the similarly overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. As for the supporting performances, the best that can be said is that Richard Harris is dour and Oliver Reed is enjoyably hammy. Joaquin Phoenix is never convincing for a moment as the emperor. His performance would be more at home in a modern high school pageant. The photography resembles a European perfume commercial more than an evocation of ancient times. I wasn't aware the only color available in Rome was gold. For a truly excellent version of the same story, check out Anthony Mann's superb 1964 FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. While both films are based on the same historical characters, GLADIATOR shamelessly ""borrows"" many plot points from the earlier film, to less effect. Russell Crowe's supporting cast cannot hope to compete with such classic actors as Alec Guiness, Christopher Plummer, James Mason and Sophia Loren in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. It would also be pointless to compare the directorial style of Anthony Mann, who is without a doubt one of the great American filmmakers of the 50s and 60s, with that of Ridley Scott, who directs like he's making a commercial for GLADIATOR perfume or a music video for a band dressed as ancient Romans. Just compare the finale man to man combat in the Arena in Scott's film with the same scene in Mann's. No comparison.",1
10 April 2001,Today I saw a film become more powerful than any other...,"Critique: 8 out of 10

Back in 1959, MGM released a film that critic's hailed and audiences adored. This film went on to win eleven academy awards, and instantly becoming a classic all around the world. This was director William Wyler's Ben-Hur. Nearly 40 years after that, comes an epic-like film, with a similar storyline, titled Gladiator. An entertaining, well-made movie, that brings back the treasures of yesterday.

The plot, although original, is cleverly written by screenplay writer's, David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the greatest military leader Rome has ever had. After defeating, the Germanic renegades, Maximus is looking toward going home to his wife and son soon. Yet, the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius wishes to give the throne over toward Maximus, instead of the rightful heir his reckless son, Commodus. Maximus isn't thrilled about the idea, and tells the Emperor he'll think about his decision. Though, before Maximus can give his answer, Commodus hears about this and kills his father out of anger. Commodus takes the throne immediately, and asks for Maximus support.

When Maximus doesn't give it, Commodus is furious and orders to execute him and his family. While Maximus barley escapes, he family doesn't. Wounded emotionally and physically, Maximus passes out, only to be captured by slave traders. Purchased by a former Gladiator, Proximus (Oliver Reed), Maximus finds himself competing in small gladiator contests. As Maximus becomes more popular, he discovers he may be able to take revenge on the man who killed his family.

Director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"", ""Hannibal"") brings to the screen, some enormous cinematography, making you feel as if you were right there among the characters. The Gladiator fight scenes are brought to life, from clever camera angles, and the frequent shaking of the camera.

Russell Crowe (""Proof of Life"", ""The Insider"") performs wonderfully, and brings to life his character's emotions. Joaquin Phoenix, plays the corrupt young Emperor well, and delivers a believable performance being crude, selfish, and full of hate against Maximus.

Supporting Actress Connie Neilson, (""Mission to Mars,"" ""Soldier"") plays the emperors sister, and Maximus former love interest (something that should have been discussed a bit more). Oliver Reed, does a fantastic job as Proximo, the retired Gladiator, who's quest is to help Maximus win his freedom.

Violence. This movie is filled with it, from a man being sliced in half, from decapitation's. While, I wouldn't have made the film this gory, it does make for a completely realistic feel!

This film is a wonderful, it has a few flaws, but besides them it has become an instant classic around the world. Though, not everyone will enjoy this film as much as I did, it's worth seeing. I give it: 8 out of 10.",10
20 December 2006,Six Years Later and Still the Best,"'Gladiator' was the movie that proved that sword-and-sandal epics were still economically viable, leading the way for 'Troy', 'Alexander', and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. It remains the best of the bunch, a near miracle considering that half of it was written well into production and one of the leads (Oliver Reed) died half way through filming.

The screenplay displays none of the usual problems usually associated with multiple writers and battling egos. It is structurally sound, admirably balancing action with drama, and the characters are all well rounded, complex and believable. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best director's around when it comes to 'action with a heart', and his vision of 2nd century Roman Europe is beautifully extended by flawless CGI that achieves exactly what it should while never drawing attention to itself. Arthur Max and Janty Yates, regular Scott collaborators, do an excellent job of bringing a warts-and-all grittiness and realism to the movie. Though the designs aren't that authentic (Imperial interiors were rarely all-black!), they play a large part in ridding the genre of the traditional toga-party kitsch.

The leads are excellent. It's to be expected that Richard Harris and Derek Jacobi can do this stuff in their sleep, and Djimon Hounsou has been playing the same role of proud and stoic nobility, albeit very well, ever since 'Amistad'. But Joaquin Pheonix, in his first real adult role, somehow manages to make a sympathetic character out of what amounts to a murdering, incestuous sociopath, and with all due respect to Benecio del Toro, the Oscar that year should have belonged to Pheonix. Russell Crowe, for all his off-screen nonsense, is able to consistently deliver such natural performances that he completely inhabits his characters and was fully deserving of his Oscar win.

'Gladiator' is an excellent movie ¬ñ a textbook example of how these kinds of movies SHOULD be done. It's a shame that the subsequent sword-and-sandal movies haven't come close to the quality of this movie. 'Gladiator' remains the benchmark and it will be a long time before it is surpassed.",10
7 February 2005,Pointless gorefest,"What we have here is a mixture of Ben Hur and Braveheart, and unsurprisingly it sucks.

The main objective of the film seems to be to cram as much gore as possible in the space of a single movie, without bothering about trivialities like story, character or meaning. If it purports to show the beastliness of staged human fights to the death it utterly fails because it only lowers the viewers to the same voyeuristic level as the Romans themselves.

Who cares about Maximus, a cardboard character with revenge as his only motivation? What to make of the crazy editing in the fight scenes that makes it impossible to understand what is going on? What with the bizarre geography and time lines? How to make sense of the opening battle which is claimed to be about a German settlement, yet takes place in the open and shows cavalry charging through a dense forest? Why the fake poetry of the hand in the wheat field? Who cares? Gore, gore and more gore, that is what sells tickets and, incredibly, delivers Oscars.

The only thing I could appreciate, contrary to many others here, is Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Commodus as he descends from mere creepiness into downright raving lunacy. Nice bit of acting. All the rest is a waste of perfectly good celluloid.",2
14 September 2003,Ridley Scott's Best Film To Date,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.

Although Gladiator is not my favorite Ridley scott film (that title belongs to Alien), I do believe it to be his best achievement. Gladiator features things Scott has improved upon from his past movies. Gladiator features some great acting, impressive direction, and very satisfying visuals.

The acting is a major strength. Russell Crowe applys himself in this role and does a very good job, he is a perfect gladiator. Connie Nielsen does an admirable job. The standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who is brilliant as Commodus, he makes the villain so deliciously evil that hes impossible to like. The supporting cast all do strong jobs too.

There is a dark tone in Gladiator. Its especially evident with the scenes between Commodus and his father. Also, between him and his sister.

The film also has stunning visuals. Great Sets, Good Cinematography, and Stunning Costumes. The Visual Effects are also top notch. The fight scenes are also expertly filmed. A Film with all these stunning visuals may lack a good script, but this film does not. Its script may not be its biggest strength, but it is well written. The film also features a rousing score. Gladiator pretty much remains entertaining throughout, it is a violent film but I wouldnt say its gratuitous. Gladiator is definitely worth your while to see.",9
31 May 2015,I was entertained even 15 years later,"Hard to believe Gladiator is 15 years old now, such a fantastic movie that will never go out of style. Super fun watching this again, it's just the classic sword & sandal flick, epic on all counts and the type of movie that stays with you for days afterwards. Admittedly the story was also a bit draggy in parts, its almost 3 hours long and at times I was confused as to where it was taking place Morocco? but the location issue is just me.

Russell Crowe is Oscar worthy as he embodies Maximus. Perfect as the strong and silent leader, the type of character you feel for and can't help but cheer along especially as he's squaring off against the awesomely crazy & creepy Joaquin Phoenix ""You will love me and bear me a pure heir"" -spoken to his sister. Phoenix was just amazing.

Of course the battle scenes are awesome; exciting, bloody and epic, starting in Germany with Russell as a Roman general leading his men into battle. He soon arouses the rage of the emperors jealous and bloodthirsty son when it becomes known that Maximus is to be the successor. A bit of murder happens then with Maximus finding himself a widower, beaten, enslaved and forced to become a gladiator. The final battle goes down at the Coliseum in Rome with an ending that I thought was perfect ""Am I not merciful?""

Really beautiful music here too, and a top notch extended cast including a SOA sighting from one Tommy Flanagan. Yes Maximus, I was entertained. 4/14/15",9
10 September 2022,"""What we do in life, echoes in eternity.""","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
11 April 2001,Nay-sayers are fools - this was well done.,"This was a triumphant film of character and the human spirit amidst treachery, with beautifully done filming and impressive acting. Crowe had an air of nobility that was impressive. I don't see how some can HATE this film. It was well done, well protrayed and well acted. If anything it is guilty of over-exposure.

What was even more of a disappointment was the fact that it won the academy award for best picture! Was the academy high on crack that year? Aside from two spectacular battle scenes, everything else was reminiscent of braveheart, which was significantly better then this. This film's plot was mediocre at best and was a true disappointment.

8 June 2001,What is a man's life worth in ancient Rome.,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.

Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.

Crowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles are:Oliver Reed, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.

From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie. Your heart will not let you forget this movie.This will be one for the ages.",8
3 June 2021,It's all been said before.,"Even after over 20 years, it's still one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is what all movies should aspire to be. It's perfect. It's amazing. Thank you, Ridley Scott.

13 January 2019,A Ridley Scott Masterclass,"Scott reinvents the epic genre with a vengeance. Sharp script, haunting music, spectacular cinematography, but the acting is just off the scale. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix demonstrate what it means for an actor to lose themselves in their role. They become Maximus and Commodus to the extent that you forget who the actors are as you watch. The multi-Oscared Streeps and Day Lewis' of the thespian universe please note how it's done. We don't want to see you in your roles but the characters you are supposed to play. Connie Nielsen was born to play the role of the Roman matron. Both in bearing and demeanor she is the most authentic Roman noble born woman since Sian Phillips' Livia in the BBC series I, Claudius. Harris and Reed give incredibly nuanced turns, but it's hard to name single actor who first do a spectacular job. I fell in love with Djimon Hounsou here...the editing must get an honourable mention. It balanced the overlapping narrative threads with such clarity the viewer is always in the know. Why is it a masterclass movie? Because you don't need to know a thing about the Roman Empire to fully get into the story and meaning of the movie. That's the hallmark of any great work of art: it gives the viewer all the parameters they need to make sense of it, without looking for contextual support outside the work.",10
11 April 2001,I laughed throughout,"This movie is unadulterated junk posing as historical spectacle. The cinematography is choppy, making it impossible to really follow any of the action sequences. I think people have been deceived after years of Tarantino worship into thinking that choppy editing makes a movie more intense or edgy or somesuch nonsense. Unfortunately, the problems with this movie extend to Crowe's monotonous acting, the distracting, boring subplots (mostly driven by secretive glances), and the historical inaccuracies.

Sorry, but America (and the academy, I'm afraid) was duped by this piece of expensive trash.

19 February 2005,Lethal Weapon without car chase,"A mediocre flick with excessive cast,excessive crowd scenes, excessive violence, excessive everything except what makes a movie more than fluffy shallow entertainment.

Remembering all the rave reviews when this movie was first shown and the awards it received I was expecting to see an outstanding movie. I was surprised and disappointed.

People who call this great movie must never have seen a great movie.

Gladiator begins with an improbable event. The old Caesar Marcus Aurelius is along in his elaborate carriage in Geremania and he calls for his son Commodus and tells him he is not going to name him Caesar but will have his favorite general Maximumus be the leader who will bring back the Republic. for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to

It's highly doubtful that none of Caesars guards are near both as witness to this important act and as protectors.

So of course Commudus kills the old man and then sends soldiers to kill Maximus. Maximus is severely wounded but escapes and then some how gets from Germania to what looks like a desert in North Africa !!

These two improbably events are followed by dozens more. There are so many why not throw in a car chase or two...

As another reviewer said,it has.. gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. .",3
23 September 2001,HUGE let-down,"Gladiator was a very very lucky movie, having been released in the awful year 2000 there is nothing in this mundane movie to fetch it 5 (!!) oscars.

Sure, Russell Crowe was very good, the casting and costume was great. The music was out of the world but the rest just fade in oblivion. The biggest disappointment for me was the poor character sketching. Where are the complex characters? Throughout the movie every character is just a good guy or the bad guy. Black or white. Where are the shades of grey? those mysterious characters that elevate drama to the next stage.

I would call this an average movie that has been over-rated because of the mediocrity that it surrounded itself with. Instead of Aussie Russell Crowe, watch his fellow A Mel Gibson in the classic ""Braveheart"" for a truly complex and heart-rending epic.

An average 5 (mostly for the music and technical wizardy)",5
2 March 2012,The olde style before substance,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.

The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.

Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.

I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.

The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.

I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.

Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.

Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.

Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf M√∂ller, and Richard Harris. Directed by: Ridley Scott.",4
10 December 2004,Historically inaccurate but entertaining,"This Roman extravaganza is fun to watch but bowderlized in typical ""Hollywood"" fashion. The final scene in the Roman Coliseum is ridiculous and descends to the level of a Cecil B. De Mille circus. Aside from that the story is entertaining and the acting, generally, very good.

Russell Crowe began his international film career with this movie and has gone from strength to strength in subsequent roles. An amazingly versatile actor, he holds the film together. The other strong performance is from the stunning looking Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, she is pure eye-candy. The two of them just about manage to blot out the miscast Joaquin Phoenix.

Bit parts are cast from the usual suspects; Derek Jacobi's predictable performance as the ersatz I Claudius senator and Oliver Reed's slovenly and decadent Proximo.

Worth a look-see but I got rid of the VHS I bought. The distortions of the truth about Emperor Comodus are just too much for this film to be taken seriously as an historical drama. It's blood and guts fantasy, nothing more.

The technical aspects are excellent.",5
19 September 2022,Film ruined by a very poor script,"What a waste of premium talent; actors, director, production resources.

Riddley Scott can direct, we've seen that; actors did their best -or almost; production was quite good, even generous, but put plainly the script was pathetic.

Oscars or not, the film is a poor attempt to match the ole pseudo-historicals or period films about.

Much as this movie is a decent thriller it doesn't deliver.

It seems that IMDB now demands verbose reviews, apologies extended but I shall fill uo with babble....

3 March 2001,Too Long And Not Very Good,"In German there is a good expression for movies such as Gladiator (G): ""Historienfilm"" -- it means that it is a movie which has a historic backdrop, but is not a movie ABOUT history. What worries me is that many people will think that G is realistic, that the historic context of it or even the entire story are accurate, which is not the case.

I found the movie definitely too long -- it would be much better if it had been cut by 45 or 60 minutes. The story line was too pompous, without much suspense, and ordinary. The ""look and feel"" (camerawork, lighting, sound track, decoration, casting, etc.) is high quality, though too glossy and commercial - like for my taste. As for believability -- oh well. Maybe seen from America ancient Germany is just a quick horse ride away from Rome and right next to a gladiator training center in the middle of the desert, but trust me -- it is not. And I do understand that there has to be a bad guy, but did it have to be a hare - lipped, father - killing, sister - fancying, paedophile dictator? And did the good guy have to be such a sickly - sweet mixture of George Washington, Rambo and Walt Whitman? And -- on a slightly jingoistic note -- if the ancient Germans were such club - swinging barbarians (""hunh? cavalry attack from back, that no fair""), how come the Romans never did capture the territory?

Conclusion: if the movie had been shortened, I would have found it OK to watch on the small screen (rental or free TV). As it is, I did not like it. And I find it depressing that such a great director as Ridley Scott seems to have dedicated himself to producing glossy, mind numbing garbage.",2
21 July 2009,Resurrection,"I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.

While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which ""resurrected"" the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions.

And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.

Edit: No I watched the longer cut (wrongly called it Director's cut above as Mr. Scott would scold me for saying that earlier - it is just an extended cut) - and unlike Ridley, I actually liked the longer cut better. It added some gravitas and much needed backstory to certain things. And while the movie overall still remains predictable, the scope of it all is plain amazing. Considering the movie started while the script wasn't completely done, might even give this more things to like ... So I reckon I was maybe a bit too harsh on my initial rating (almost everyone I did watch it with fell asleep though), but the rating now is for the rewatch.

I still think that other movies (be it the old Spartacus or the newer TV show Spartacus to name a few) did it better ... but considering my love for Sandal movies as a kid, I should have seen the love that was put into this. No matter how easy to decipher and the cliches that were put in. And the fun Russell Crowe had on set .. the behind the scenes pranks, might give you a new view and love for this as well I reckon.",8
27 June 2010,A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7
20 March 2005,"A good try, but too many flaws for ""classic"" status.","Gladiator is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of a man's revenge against the backdrop of the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe stars as a successful general who is sold into slavery after being deposed by a ruthless upstart young emperor. We see him fight his way through the ranks as a gladiator and eventually square off against the young tyrant on the floor of the coliseum. Though not a historically accurate film, it is still worth seeing for a few of the fight scenes, and some of the performances.

Crowe is as good as he needs to be as Maximus, the deposed general who only wishes to return home to harvest his crops after defeating a barbaric army at the film's beginning. However the dying old emperor, well-played by Richard Harris, wants to hand over control of Rome to this fine man. When the emperor's evil son hears of this plan, he kills his father and takes control of the empire. Since Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to the new emperor, he is order to be killed along with his wife and child. Maximus escapes the Roman soldiers, but is soon captured and sold into slavery as a gladiator. The rest of the film is centered around Maximus and his plans to overthrow the young emperor with the help of the emperor's sister and a few well-meaning senators.

Gladiator could have been a great film, but it's a little unfocused, and some of the scenes could have been filmed a little better. For example, the opening battle starts off well. We see a fully-armed Roman army set to do battle with a Germanic hoard. We get some good shots of Roman archers and infantry men launching a barrage of arrows and flaming debris on the barbarians, and that looks pretty impressive. However, when the battle becomes hand-to-hand combat, everything becomes too murky and hard to follow. Some of the fight scenes between gladiators have the same sort of problems. Maximus, as his instructor tells him, does in fact kill too quickly. Sometimes he has dispatched five or six men without us even realizing how he did it. True he was an experienced soldier who would have gone for quick and efficient kills, but the spectacle is lost in some instances. The re-created Battle of Carthage is probably the most memorable combat scene, and it works fairly well.

Few of the characters in this film are likable or well-defined. Oliver Reed gets the best lines, but his character is never fully developed to the point that we understand him. This could be the result of his untimely death during filming, though. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi also have curious roles in the sense that we never really know who's side they are on, or if they are only using Maximus. There is an implied close relationship between both Maximus and Nielsen's character, but it leads nowhere. When I first saw this film, I thought Jaoquin Phoenix was over-acting badly, but now I'm not so sure. It is more than likely that a young emperor of Rome would have behaved with selfishness and paranoia, and Phoenix seems to revel in his role.

Overall, this film reminds me quite a bit of Conan the Barbarian. We have similar scenes and themes throughout. Also, we even get an appearance by Sven Thorsen who played a bad guy in Conan. Here, he plays a former champion who comes out of retirement to challenge Maximus in one exciting scene.

This film is really no better than Conan The Barbarian, and Crowe lacks Ahnold's charisma and physique.

Bottom line: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a look, but not really Best Picture material.

The hound has spoken.",7
4 May 2019,21st Century Modern Entertainment,"Sadly, some movies like Robin Hood, Alexander, and Ben-hur remake will never be as good as this movie. This is one of the most epic movie I have ever scene. Crowe did an amazing job playing as Maximus and also Phoenix did an amazing job playing the most hated villains in cinema. This will go on as the first epic movie in the 21st century.

27 March 2001,Another Curious Best Picture Winner,"""Gladiator"" is a special effects tour de force that tries to combine the major elements of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Braveheart"" but fails to generate the interest, intensity, or intelligence of either of those films. Military General Russell Crowe (Oscar-winning) is going to take over the throne of Rome when ruler Richard Harris passes away. Son Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar-nominated) finds out and takes matters into his own hands (literally). Crowe is to be killed, but he escapes and becomes a slave. His family has also been slaughtered in the venture. Crowe is then bought by the wise Oliver Reed and learns that the coliseum is to reopen with gladiator games. Now he is a gladiator and he wins over the country and continues his plans to get revenge on Phoenix. ""Gladiator"" is definitely a good-looking film and it is well-made. The costume designs, editing, special effects, and direction are all exceptional. However, the screenplay is nothing special. It has been done dozens of times before in better films. All the performers seem overwhelmed by the production as well. Crowe does admirably, but his part is not very complicated at all. His Oscar win is a bit strange. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Djimon Hounsou, and the late Oliver Reed are all disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent though with his laid-back, but sometimes over-the-top performance. He is the spark that the film desperately had to have. The incestuous and deviant sexual under-tones do nothing to help out the film and end up being an unnecessary distraction. Overall a good film, but ""Traffic"" should have won the Best Picture Oscar in 2000. 4 stars out of 5.",

4 February 2017,"Okayish, but not great","Roman General Maximus has everything going for him - he is a highly skilled and successful general, he has a wife and child whom he adores, the people love him and the aging Emperor loves him. The Emperor proclaims him his successor before he dies. However, this proves costly for Maximus as it creates tension between him and the Emperor's son, Commodus. Commodus has Maximus wife and child murdered. Maximus escapes before being executed himself, only to be captured and enslaved. He becomes a gladiator and fights to regain his status. Moreover, he is determined to take revenge on Commodus.

Pretty much a standard action/revenge movie, set in Roman times. Lots of fight scenes and not much else, including profundity.

Somehow won the 2001 Best Picture Oscar, beating, amongst others, the far-superior Traffic.",6
11 December 2015,The best. Simple as that.,"I will start off by declaring that, IMO, this is the best film I've ever seen.

Why? Well, the reasons are many. First up, the acting is superb. All the major players put in excellent turns, as do the bit-part actors. Russell Crowe will never inhabit another character the way he does Maximus. He looks like he was born to play this part. He presents us a man with immense charisma, authority, bravery, honour and dignity. A man prepared to die for what is right. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an emperor, Commodus, that is entirely credible: one minute, he's reasonable and lucid, the next, he is psychotic. Oliver Reed, in his final role, is an excellent lanista (director of a gladiator school). Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister and would-be lover of Maximus, has to run the gauntlet of Commodus' psychotic behaviour to preserve her's and her son's lives. All in all, top notch acting all-round. They're given a great story and script to work with, too.

The cinematography is magnificent. The colours the dust, great camera angles, judicious cutting around scenes. It works to create intense images that place the actors firmly in the forefront. The digital recreation of roses is amazing and you have to look very hard to detect the digital effects. Ridley Scott has produced one of his greatest directing achievements.

Finally, the music, from Hans Zimmer, is magnificent. It supports the action and moods of the scenes expertly, without ever intruding too much, which is the mark, IMO, of a great score and soundtrack.

If you have not seen this movie, or bought the Blu-Ray, I have only one question: why not? This is a MUST WATCH movie. Simple as that.",10
15 August 2007,"A massive epic, Ridley Scott's work of art - Simply a masterpiece","""Gladiator"" is, to me, one of the best films ever made, probably even in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time -list. It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.

Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't clich√© at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.

What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.

This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. ""Gladiator"" is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.",9
12 February 2019,"The script is saved by Crowe, Reed and the action scenes","Somewhere alone the way of writing this story each of the writers seemingly made each section more direct and clearer. Unfortunately, they ended up going way too far. The script doesn't have much, if any, subtext. There is a brutal directness in the writing that makes the film cheesy in its obviousness. Some of this might be intentional because story is very much one of blunt masculinity. Further, some the choices made in regards to the history are just laughably bad. No Rome did not become a republic again in 180 AD (or whatever). Commodus is made far to much of a coward as well. The script is very poorly executed through at least the board outlines of the story is quite good.

But the movie is largely saved by Scott's direction. The story is a big dumb slice of blood sport and machismo; the visuals know this and lean into these aspects. Scott directions the actions scenes withe glee. The MTV style editing is recognizably early 2000's but it works extremely well in this film. Likewise, the less pristine and grimier visuals really fit Rome as a symbol of corruption. This is probably the best movie that could have been rung out of the script.

Scott is greatly aided by Crowe, Reed and Phoenix. While all are a bit too pitched to be truly great, each of them turn in electrifying performances that patch up the script. Crowe gets emotion from the cheesiest and cliche lines. Phoenix manages to make a flat villain feel much more rounded (especially in the extended cut) and human. But Reed is absolutely the standout. Proximo is THE lovable rogue of the 2000's. Reed gives a performance of such glee and relish that he really helps you embrace the weaknesses of the script as charms.

Should never have been in the Best Picture race but this film has aged well.",7
16 March 2001,Excellent movie,"Excellent movie.. The atmosphere is so well captured in here.. you can almost smell the blood and sweat!! I felt the pain and the pride of the characters throughout the movie..

In spite of all the evil he has done, he was just a jealous kid, who longed for the love and affection of his family. and those whom he loved most had betrayed him!! His sister and his father!! ""your faults as a son, is my failure as a father"" that was the sentence that cleared it all!!

28 September 2005,Extended Edition is more than shadows and dust.,"NOTE: REVIEW PERTAINS TO EXTENDED EDITION

**WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

I'm going to apologize ahead of time to everyone reading this, as it may be a little biased. Why? Because I believe Gladiator is one of the greatest films ever made. As far as favorite films go, this is one of my top five. In fact, as I think about it, it rests only behind ""Evil Dead"" and ""American Beauty"" for me.

Of course, who now isn't familiar with this story? The Roman Legion General Maximus, Russel Crowe, is the main figure. The film follows his journey from General to slave to gladiator. It is also the story of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and his usurping of the throne of Emperor, as well as his knowledge of the people of Rome (the mob), and his lack of knowledge of politics. It follows the side-story of the planning to de-throne Commodus and restore the Republic that once was Rome. All with staggering sets and scenes, a rousing musical score, and a cast of believable, and realistically portrayed characters.

Here's the breakdown:

What's New:

--17 minutes of added material, according to the DVD case.

--Countless scenes have extra shots here and there basically adding to the detail of Rome, the environment and atmosphere.

--Proximo (Oliver Reed), the man who first purchases Maximus to be a gladiator, is seen being enticed to bet against Maximus and Juba (Djimon Hounsou) in their first gladitorial bout when they are chained together.

--Prior toanother early bout--where Maximus alone is the fighter in the arena against several other men--we see Proximo telling him to entertain the crowd.

--A new conversation during the time when Maximus is scarring himself in an attempt to remove the mark of the Legion from his shoulder.

--Several new scenes of a subplot concerning the poor job Commodus is doing as Emperor and what needs to be done to rid Rome of his influence.

--Commodus rages against a statue of his father after finding out Maximus still lives.

--An execution of those Commodus believes lied to him about the execution of Maximus.

--The revelation that the extremely large gladiator, Hagen (Ralf Moeller), under Proximo is a German barbarian (which adds some depth and insight into a brief exchange between the barbarian and Maximus later on).

--Little more depth added to Quintus (Tomas Arana), a member of the Pretorian Guard.

The Good:

--The acting is superb and believable--Russel Crowe's performance is powerful and often heart-breaking.

--The sets and costumes are perfect--you believe you actually are in Rome. The colors, images, and scale are vibrant, breathtaking, and immense.

--Brilliant atmosphere and cinematography.

--Some of the best fight/battle sequences I've personally ever seen in a film of this nature. Sure, ""Braveheart"" chopped more limbs, but these bouts were more personal and more face-to-face. No running-through-a-field-swinging-a-blade-randomly here.

--Added footage fills in many gaps.

--Among the best music of any motion picture, in my very humble opinion. I can't count the times when the music and themes from this film have wandered randomly into my mind.

--Some of the best dialogue and lines of any film of this nature. A far cry above the Neanderthal ramblings of Brad Pitt in ""Troy.""

Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:

--The added scenes may or may not be to the flavor of some people. Personally, I really liked them and the added depth to the story and characters in the film. For me, several small gaps and conversations now make more sense. No new battle footage--that was all kept in the theatrical (also Director's) cut.

--At 2 hours and 51 minutes, it may be too much for some people now--but those people don't matter.

The Bad:

--Not one damn thing. Although, some may be disappointed by the lack of any new battle footage.

The Ugly:

--Many people complained about the quality of the backgrounds behind the massive sets. Frankly, they don't bother me one bit. You know why? Because a tiny imperfection in the background image in an otherwise perfect film doesn't detract from the film's power or quality in any way.

Memorable Scene:

--There are far too many. But for the sake of filling this in: The first time Maximus reveals himself as still living to Commodus as well as the climactic final battle between the two. Also, Proximo's Gladiators' first great event in the Colisseum--where they won when they were supposed to lose. You see? Too many to pick just one...

Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 10/10 (more than the R-rated version) Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (quantity--based around Commodus's infatuation with his sister, some dialogue) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (quantity--all high quality) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10

Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10

Overall: 10/10

Frankly, if you're a fan of Gladiator or even Russel Crowe, you need to get this version of the film. If you're a war/epic/battle-film fan, you'll also greatly enjoy it. Standard film buffs--see it. Standard movie goers... well if you've seen the original, and only ""liked"" it or thought it was just ""okay"" or even ""not your cup of tea,"" may find nothing new here to hold any interest. Personally, I highly recommend it, but then again, it is one of my personal favorite films.

4 March 2001,Ho hum,"The lead reviewer, who thinks this is one of the two greatest films ever made, must not have seen many films. Crowe, a sort of uninteresting Richard Burton, is Shane--the little good guy who beats up and kills all the bad guys. The film itself, designed for teens, is a mixture of pro wrestling and sentimentality. The religious aspect is laughable. The political correctness is boring.

Better to see The Robe, with the real Richard Burton.

17 January 2020,Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?,"Russell Crowe won an Academy Award for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was great here as his Julius Caesar, power hungry and vengeful. His father, the Emperor, has chosen Maximus (Crowe) to succeed him. Julius kills his own father and terrifies his own sister. He kills Maximus' wife and son. Maximus is presumed dead but survives and avenges Caesar. It's a grand spectacle something like an old epic from the golden days of Hollywood. The acting is quite good with casting Richard Harris and Sir Derek Jacobi in supporting roles. The film is done well but it's very long though.

31 May 2018,"I came, I saw , I conquered","Veni, Vedi, Vici- the Latin phrase translated to I came, I saw , I conquered. This is a master collaboration, between Russel Crowe (whom I have seen in other roles before and as Maximus Aurelius is supreme) , and Ridley Scott, the revolutionary Einstein of film making and the phrase comes to mind whenever I see this film. These two are the men's men and Gladiator is a movie about rising and falling and rising and falling again but with dignity and passion. Another standout is Joaquin Phoenix who played the conniving, power-hungry, incapable, brutal, unpopular emperor who killed his father for the throne and framed Maximus and killed his wife and son for it. Who will ever forget, "" And I shall have my revenge, in this life or the next "" . I disagree with some commenting that this film is testosterone packed for this is a tale as true as it can be and it's not only about the fight scenes and action but more about our own mirror of moral compass , survival, honor and love. A two thumbs up movie .

21 April 2002,mediocre and overrated,"It is as if everybody read that this film was suppossed to have great special effects and even though they see mediocre special effects, average cinematography, and poor art direction, they still walk out and say, ""Gee, those special effects sure were great."" This film is largely boring, stupid, and somewhat of an insult to the grand epics of yesteryear. Though Russell Crowe deserved an Oscar for The Insider (a film that also deserved an Oscar for best picture), he certainly did not for Gladiator.

12 March 2005,Plenty of Action & Excitement,"The "" Gladiator"" did not sound like a film that I would enjoy, however, this film was full of action scenes and great photography. Russell Crowe(Maximus),""Proof of Life"",2000, played an excellent role as the General of the Roman Army and the battle scenes and weapons used in those early A.D. ages was extremely well done. Maximus was well loved by the Roman soldiers as well as Ceasar. Connie Nielsen,(Lucilla),""Basic"",'03, was the daughter of Ceasar and was a former lover of Maximus. There are a great deal of twists and turns in this story concerning Maximus and he eventually has the great task of fighting among Gladiators. There are great tones hinting about possible incest between a sister and her brother and very little romance. However, this film will take you way back in History and show in great detail war tactics from the past.

8 July 2000,If you like to see heads chopped off then this is for you,"The critical acclaim for this movie really puzzles me. It's basically like one of those old Roman epics from the 50s starring Victor Mature with a bunch of really harsh violence thrown in. When I wasn't cringing at limbs being hacked off and the like I was just impatiently waiting for the damn thing to end. I would have left if my wife hadn't liked it.

19 April 2001,Enjoying the spectacle even more on DVD,"In my first review of Gladiator, I said it had good action. I think I was a little too subtle with that, because after watching this movie for the first time in a year on the grand DVD, and I see why this film won best picture (though I still feel this is 2nd best to Traffic and Traffic was snubbed like Saving Pvt. Ryan in 99, only that Gladiator isn't mediocre like Shakespeare in Love is).

Russell Crowe, as in all of his films commands the attention of the viewer every minute he's on the screen (though once again, Tom Hanks did it better though and also deserved the Oscar, but I'm not mad about it) as a man who is changed as he goes from respected general, to disgraced slave, and then back to respected Gladiator. Smart, exciting moviemaking all the way, with Scott delivering good direction to the scenes and the rest of the cast being good deliverers to the film (fans of old film stars Reed, Harris and Jacobi will find this a treat). Even better than I thought it was back last May, and with time should become a classic like Bravheart, though that is better (I also was a little subtle with Braveheart's spectacle). A+",9
22 November 2000,"Powerful, Herculean Filmmaking","Director Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a stunning, powerful epic that boasts some fantastic visuals, a solid story, deep characters, intense fight sequences, and bravura performances, making it very likely to grab a few Oscar nominations. At the least, it's certainly the most entertaining film of the 2000 summer.

Russel Crowe stars as General Maximus, devoted to the glory of Rome and a successful military man. When the dying Emperor decides to appoint Maximus as his successor, scheming prince Commodus (a brilliant Joaquin Phoenix) decides to do whatever it takes to assure he will be the next Caesar. Maximus escapes his clutches, but then returns to Rome as a gladiator and wants to exact revenge upon the evil emperor

As Maximus, Russel Crowe shows he is not only a great actor, but a star: Gladiator virtually secures his stature as a leading man. His performance as Maximus is strong and emotional. Though his acting talent was proven when he played Bud White in Curtis Hanson's atmospheric L.A. Confidential, Gladiator proves he can carry a film as a major star. His character is also not a cardboard cutout and shows depth: the writers, thankfully, don't make Maximus a macho, indestructible killing machine and instead he shows sensitivity, devotion, power, and strength.

Thankfully, the writers do not forget the villainous counterpart and also give Emperor Commodus depth , replacing what could be the usual out-and-out tyrant character with a tragic, weak, and ultimately inept ruler. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Commodus, in some scenes evoking pity for his character, only to become reviling in the next. While Gladiator can be seen as a star vehicle for Crowe, it can also be seen as a display of the fantastic talent Joaquin Phoenix has. His controlled, calculated performance is effectively cringe-inducing.

Director Ridley Scott not only gets great performances from the entire cast, but the visual effects employed are equally stunning. The magnificent views of Rome, the towering, hulking Collosseum, the brutal, striking battles, and intricate costumes all are used to immerse the viewer in the spectacle that was once Rome. While the story may drag a bit in a few places, the overall power is not muted one bit thanks to Scott's masterful helming of this powerful, entertaining film.

27 February 2003,Ridley's Best,"I believe Gladiator to be Ridley Scott's best movie. It is filled with Excellent Sets, Beautiful Costumes and good Cinematography. The movie also has a Great Original Score (which should have won) and fantastic Visual Effects. Visually, this movie is beautiful.

Ridley Scott's direction is excellent too. Russell Crowe gives a really good performance, he was deserving of his award. Joaquin Phoenix gives a chilling, dark and excellent performance. The rest of the cast delivers good performances too. Overall, 10 out of 10.

13 August 2000,"Take ""Spartacus"" and subtract: beauty, heroism, intelligence, competent editing ...","I love ancient world epics. Before seeing ""Gladiator"" I didn't think it was possible to make one that isn't worth watching; and, indeed, Ridley Scott hasn't done so either, although he certainly seems to have tried, and his film certainly is bad. For a film set in Rome at its most magnificent there's remarkably little spectacle (and what little there is is largely computer-generated - appallingly). For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing. Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp. This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on. How I miss the clean, clear spectacle of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"". The other thing I miss is a score by Alex North or (better still) Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa. Hans Zimmer's music (think of ""Crimson Tide"", but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.

Well, not entirely. Every so often - not VERY often, mind you - some STORY coalesces out of the cinematic debris, and some grandeur rises above the digital fog. As I said: is it even POSSIBLE to make an ancient world epic in which this never happens? But such moments are rare, and usually undercut by some conceit of Scott's. They never last very long.

I'm amused (I know people tend to say they're amused when they're really annoyed; okay, perhaps I'm also annoyed) by those who say that this is a story of simple heroism, unsuited for cynics. The reverse is true. If you're more cynical than I am you'll probably like the film better. Two instances:

(1) When Lucilla meets Maximus in his cell, the latter has suddenly become the most cynical, world-weary, why-bother person on the planet; he refuses to so much as lift a finger to help Rome despite the fact that he has nothing to lose, and despite the fact that quest Lucilla offers him neatly coincides with everything he's been dreaming of for the past year or so. Where did THAT come from? I'm sure that one of the bullet points in ""Screenwriting for Dummies"" is: ""make your hero a reluctant hero""; although I expect they go on to add, ""but not reluctant to the point of selfish petulance"".

(2) Commodus threatens to kill Lucius unless Lucilla betrays all the good guys. Well and good. But then we cut IMMEDIATELY to shots of the consequences of Lucilla's betrayal, and it becomes clear that we were meant to infer that Lucilla would, of course, turn traitor - Scott didn't think it worthwhile to show us what Lucilla's response was. The possibility that she would make a sacrifice for the cause she knows to be right is not meant to even OCCUR to us. (And it's not as if her character is so clearly defined that we have any idea how she, in particular, will act. It's clearly meant to be a GENERAL LAW that nobody makes noble sacrifices.)

The last point reminds me how poorly defined ALL the characters are. Some blame the acting, or the dialogue, for this, but there's nothing wrong with either: in fact, most of the lines are stirring - ""corny"", my foot - and impeccably delivered. The problem lies deeper. ""Gladiator"" has a disjointed, stitched-together script filmed by a director with no clear idea of what it was meant to be about.

P.S.: Surprisingly many people, including professional critics who should know better, have exhumed the mouldering old chestnut about how bloody modern cinema is the modern equivalent of the Ancient World's bloody gladiatorial combat. Some even think that when Maximus cries out, ""Are you not entertained?"", he's talking to us. Well, Scott's film is stupid in many ways, but this isn't one of them. Cinema is FICTION: it wouldn't appeal to us if it weren't. Gladiatorial combat was REAL: it wouldn't have appealed to the ancients if it weren't. Modern sport, and modern documentaries, are much closer to being modern equivalents of gladiatorial combat; but why suppose there IS a modern equivalent?",5

22 July 2000,"If this movie is a joke, then it's a bad joke...","Is this movie meant to be a joke ? A parody of what it could have been ? A motion picture that presumes to be (visually) ""a Roman Saving Private Ryan"" but carefully avoids showing the horrors that were plain in Saving Private Ryan. Somewhere I get the idea that either producer or director must have thought : ""Yes great, let him charge into his opponent and hack his head of with one single mighty sweep. But, as we want as many spectators as we can get, let's put a tree between the audience and the guy who gets his head chopped off."" So there you are, half the movie embedded in a semblance of violence that pretends to be shocking but isn't in the least. Which is acceptable if you're broadminded enough, after all there's the other half of the movie. Unfortunately the actors (with the exception of the revered Derek Jacobi) must have felt similarly about the ""action"" scenes, because they try with all their might to ""act"" their way through the rest of the movie. There's nothing as irritating as an actor being very aware of the fact that he's acting and showing it ! See how good I am ? But even then : the story might be good. Which it isn't. The story of ""Gladiator"" is a flimsy excuse for a second rate B-movie plot . With excuses to anyone who ever wrote a B-movie plot. Did anyone actually get paid for writing this ? Historically staggeringly incorrect hardly begins to describe it ! Full of dead ends (let's not reveal the ""plot"") and dead dialogue. May I suggest something ? Don't spend money to see it. If you really have to, wait until some channel puts it on tv and tape it (you don't want to watch it at 4 in the morning anyway, because that will probably be the time they broadcast it...)",1

""gladiator"", although a technically well made movie, suffers from bad writing and average acting (although joaquin phoenix is good). russell crowe is always a good actor, but even he seems weighed down by the action and special effects to be able to give an in-depth performance - i can't help but feel his oscar was more of a nod for his performance in ""the insider"" more than anything else. i admit it would have been a good movie to see on the big screen, but even then there are some backdrops that look.. well, like backdrops. overall, it was eyecandy trying to be something more, and out of the five nominees for best picture it was the weakest.

liked the tigers though - why weren't they given

29 July 2022,One of the greatest movies ever made!,"I just watched Gladiator again for the first time in many many years, and I've come to realize just how awesome this movie really is.

Maybe it's because most movies these days sucks compared to the old classics like Gladiator but everything about this movie is just perfect!

Thus, this is one of the easiest movies to rate a solid 10 because it's just so damn good, from the acting to the scenery, to the action scenes, to the story, to the dialogue to the music, to EVERYTHING!

The fact that the movie is over 2.5 hours long is not negative in any sense either. In fact, it just adds to the quality of the story.

This is more than just a movie, it's a masterpiece where the director, Ridley Scott managed to do everything right from the beginning to the end.

Gladiator is not one of those movies you watch again and again on a weekly basis. Instead, just like wine, it only gets better over the years when you watch it again and compare it to modern day movies.

All in all, if you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, go watch it NOW! It's a timeless classic that will never be forgotten.",10
7 May 2000,Visually stunning; effectively revives a grand genre,"Combining visual elements pioneered in BLADE RUNNER with battle scenes depicted in a way reminiscent of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Ridley Scott has successfully revived the long dead genre of movies about ancient Rome. Yes, there have been pathetic, postmodern attempts to cinematically resurrect Rome since the Golden Age of ancient epics of the 50s and early 60s, but none have come close to the historic-artistic integration that Scott has pulled off in GLADIATOR. This movie is so beautiful, that a slide show of selected stills could stand on its own as a work of art.

An excellent cast is headed by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, the latter being the first actor to succeed at portraying one of the ""bad"" Roman emperors as something more than a one-dimensional villain. Even evil Emperors deserve better depiction than Hollywood has given them over the years. Connie Nielsen, absolutely ravishing in Roman finery, also carries her role very well. Richard Harris, as Marcus Aurelius, is so good that he really does look like a dying man (I sure hope it's just good acting and makeup!), and of course, it's always great to see Derek Jacobi in a show about ancient Rome. Oliver Reed was excellent in his last film; he will be missed.

I predict that GLADIATOR will catalyze a revival of public interest in ancient Rome, which is a long time coming. I hope also that this film heralds a renaissance in Ridley Scott's career. It had been way too long since ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER.",9
16 May 2023,"I am entertained, but I still think it's overrated","I may have been too harsh on Gladiator. I think because it arrived shortly after Braveheart, and it won Best Picture, I was more critical of it. This is a good movie. However, I still don't think it's as amazing as many people think it is. They struggled writing the script, which I think shows on the screen. The acting is also uneven, with some great moments and some weaker ones. However, the score is absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects are top-notch. I enjoyed watching it more this time around, but I still think that Cast Away should have won Best Picture of 2000 instead of Gladiator.

8 January 2003,Great Movie,"I was very hesitant to watch this movie based on the commercials. I thought it would be a boring movie about a guy fighting lions. But, the movie is great!!! It combines an action movie with a love story (love of country). It definitely ranks in my top 10 of all time. Honestly, this is one of the few movies EVER that made me cry. Great plot, excellent acting and wonderful script.

2 December 2006,A return to epic film making,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9

14 February 2003,The movie that puts back History on your radar,"Can you still make a great period movie, which is commercially viable too in these days? Apparently you can, as Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe prove with this magnum opus.

What strikes you most about ""Gladiator"" are not the dazzling sets and costumes - though they contribute to the effect too. Where ""Gladiator"" delivers is in the area of raw human emotions we are so familiar with.

As somebody said, switching to the other mind-set is half the fun, and Gladiator takes you right to the midst of Romans' politics, their passions, their dreams and their weaknesses.

After Ben-Hur, I feel this is the best period movie to have ever emerged from Hollywood.

21 May 2001,Tragedy of symbolism over storytelling,"The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)

Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events.

None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion.

Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.

In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964).",7

2 June 2001,Ready to go to ancient Rome.,"Russell Crowe as Roman general Maximus leaves viewers amazed with his performance which won Crowe a best actor Oscar. Maximus winds up a gladiator after he refuses to pledge loyalty to the son of the dying Aurelius. Orders then come for Maximus to be executed only to lead to many great battles some of the most violent in film history that's just the way it was in ancient Rome times. Gladiator is a great movie to see if you like the historical/drama type and enjoy great battle scenes.

19 April 2000,Crowe is outstanding in this bloody Roman epic,"At the centre of the pic is a solid performance by Russell Crowe, which should finally cement his reputation as one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. He's as tough and mean as he was in LA Confidential with a likeable heroic edge.

Director Ridley Scott manages a near return to form. The action scenes are visually impressive, but somewhat messy, but I suppose he'd say he was capturing the chaos of battle.

There are numerous panoramic Roman vistas but they're obviously, for the most part, CGI (and are strangely always accompanied by poorly executed flocks of CGI birds). Also, to my eye, it was clear which of Oliver Reed's scenes were re-edited with doubles and/or digital composites.

These are minor grumbles though -- for the most part Gladiator is a mean, bloody, sprawling epic. The supporting cast are all great: Connie Nielsen is as alluring as ever, Joaquim Phoenix is a fine baddie (despite being slightly miscast; occasionally struggling with a british accent) and Richard Harris is great in a small role.

On the whole the script is strong but, as is often the case with blockbusters, it's unfortunately drowned out by sound effects and, in this case, by a heavy-handed score.

My main grumble is the film begins with a Saving Private Ryan style battle sequence, contains numerous large scale action sequences in the interim, but the finale is just a plain-old run-of-the-mill two man swordfight. Yes, it's very exciting but it felt like it needed a grander end fight.",

17 January 2002,Echoing through eternity!,"I went to the movie theater to go see a good action filled with fighting and bloodshed. Instead, I witnessed a truly awesome story that happened to have some fighting and bloodshed. From the acting to the directing, and especially to the screenplay, this movie is spectacular!

Russell Crowe turns in a fine performance. Many of his critics who feel that he shouldn't have won an Oscar for his performance are taking it one step further and saying that he was downright dull. I don't know if Crowe deserved the Best Actor Oscar, but I do know that dull he was anything but. He is the only one I know who could have played Maximus and given him any depth and at the same time be convincingly intimidating. Kudos to the arguably best actor in showbiz!

Joaquin Phoenix's work as Commodus was severely underrated. It didn't take but one minute before I hated Commodus with a deep hatred. His scenes with Lucilla (Connie Nelson) are just plain eerie, causing me to hate him more.

This is easily Ridley Scott's best job as a director. He gives ""Gladiator"" an elegance and a darkness that together make the movie quite unique.

5 July 2002,"It is indeed a cliched ripoff of past Roman films, exacerbated by needless computer animation","The story is just a cross between Ben-Hur (who is made a slave while his family is imprisoned by a naughty Roman bureaucrat) and Spartacus, the slave-turned-gladiator-turned-revolutionary. Fine, I can deal with that. But shouldn't a film about Roman times at least attempt to make viewers feel like they're in ancient Rome? Instead, we've got what almost appears to be a video game about colliseum fighting, with rapid moving, computer-generated adversaries slashing about and losing their heads almost out of theatregoers' sights. CGI has its place in the cinema I'm sure (though I have yet to see a film that utilizes it effectively), but not here. Watch it to pass time and for a very mild thrill, but expect no more.

5 August 2004,Maximus Rules...,"I love this movie. It's what cinema was made for. Everything about it...the acting, Ridley Scott's directing, the screenplay, the score...is wonderful. Russell Crowe gives a magnificent portrayal of Maximus, the Roman Army General who is betrayed by the jealous Emperor and who becomes a gladiator to avenge the murder of his wife and child.

Russell Crowe deservedly won an Oscar for his performance! The swarthy, sexy, manly Maximus...has there ever been a more charismatic character on screen? Maximus is the kind of man that you would follow to the end of the earth. The personal journey that he goes through, from proud general to defeated slave to celebrity gladiator, is extremely moving...and the film's strong spiritual subtext made me extremely emotional. This film has one of the most moving endings ever.

There is great acting from all the cast...Joaquin Phoenix makes a fantastic boo-hiss villain, and there is also excellent support from Connie Nielsen and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.

In short...Yes, I Am Entertained!",10
8 January 2010,I had high expectations for this film but sadly it didn't live up to them,I cannot say that this film is really bad or really good but it just didn't do it for me. I have now watched it three times and have not changed my mind after the first time I saw it. It didn't 'feel' right and although I can safely say that a lot of time and effort went into its creation I just cannot in all seriousness recommend this film to anyone. The story line is fairly strong and most of the performances are reasonable but I was not impressed with the special effects. The special effects in my opinion did not enhance my enjoyment of the film indeed they had a negative effect on me. On my initial viewing I was also not at all impressed with the leading man. Russell Crowe in my opinion was given far too much praise for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was adequate and some of the other performances were OK but in my opinion there was more than one person miscast in this film and overall this is not a good combination. I am not at all interested and never have been that I may be the only one who happens to be a dissenting voice. I will not be watching this film again because its not good enough to hold my attention and it does not have sufficient quality. For the first time viewer who is insistent on watching this film I would say don't get carried away by the hype surrounding this film and just keep an open mind.,5
25 June 2000,"You can't kill me, I'm the Emper-arrgh...","Nasty, dark, brooding piece of work about a guy who always seems to either kill the people he meets, or just get them killed. A long involved plot and the guy can't seem to get out of trouble any other way than to kill people. At least that's what appears to be happening, between the dark light, constant rain, chopping strobe effects, and general attempt to avoid an X rating, you're often left guessing as to what actually happened. This one is definitely for fans of Fight Club and Triumph Of The Will.

16 January 2020,A Master Piece,"Everything about this film was extremely well done. The acting was superb! Russel Crowe makes you truely feel for him amd Jaqulin Phenoix makes you utterly hate him. The fighting scenes are extremely enteraining and interesting! The story portrayed in the film is very moving and is an attention grabber from the start of the Movie. The tone of the show is quite serious, but that's expected with this kind of genre. If you love sword fighting shows then this is a must see.

21 November 2006,C.B. would be proud,"It's a shame Cecil B. DeMille is no longer with us. If he were alive today he would be gratified to see that the type of movies he loved to make are popular again: ""Gladiator,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" are all the kinds of movies DeMille made; all of them are movies he would have made if the screenplays had been around in his day. ""Gladiator"" is a gloriously retro sword-and-sandal epic, a cross-pollination of ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben Hur,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""; director Ridley Scott uses modern CGI technology to make the kind of movie they don't make any more. Although not 100% historically accurate, it's irresistible drama. Russell Crowe is one of the few actors today who can pull off this kind of heroic role; he has the gravitas despite his bad-boy reputation in real life that blond pretty boys like Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell can never hope to approach. Connie Nielsen is a sensuous presence as Lucilla; River Phoenix as Commodus is the creepiest villain since Ralph Fiennes' Amos Goetz in ""Schindler's List""; and the supporting cast is full of stand out performances. It's good to see ""I Claudius""'s Derek Jacobi back in toga; what's an epic without Richard Harris? and of course Oliver Reed as the lovably irascible slave-trader Proximo, who proves not to be such a bad guy after all. The film completely ignores the persecution of Christians under the otherwise humane Marcus Aurelius; but then, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ignores the presence of slavery in the eighteenth-century West Indies.",10
2 January 2007,real life situation for an epic,"There's all you might imagine, a real life situation for an epic. Remember that such battles where very common, not to mention the thousands of lives lost. Ridley Scott put the viewer into suspense and tension during the very first battle we had, not to mention the grandiose strategy Maximus had.

Shot in Malta: Ricasli and other locations, the arena built had over 5000 extras. All awaiting for the signal...

Roar did the crowd when Maximus entered. They loved him, a man of honour, a normal being, a prisoner, a warrior. Their HERO!

Ridley Scott direction excelled at its best in Gladiator conveying the authenticity of life, our ancestors have lived!

4 July 2021,Extraordinary film...,"This film is really a masterpiece. It tells a lot about Roman Empaire and their bravery, art of war, cruelness. It shows how painful was the life of Roman slaves and how they were forced to take part in the brutal game 'Gladiator' and risk their life to entertain the Roman civilians. The director done very good job and the two lead actors; Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are brilliant.

4 June 2012,A terrific film.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10

10 July 2020,Russell Crowe and her gladiator,"""Gladiator"" is a fantastic movie from start to finish, Russell Crowe plays an incredible role some of the best, and his music and how not to forget the last role of the British actor Oliver Reed as Prospero.

The movie was nominated for 12 Oscars and won 5.

9 May 2021,Not quite as good as Braveheart...,"...though still pretty good, definitely the best non-sci-fi film of Ridley Scott's career. They opening battle is definitely awesome, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack delivers, and the (though a little cliched now) revenge story is decently engaging.

BUT, Scott fails on a few points. He drags in the shaky cam in many of the gladiator scenes, which comes close to outright ruining them. There are also a couple scenes featuring some sketchy CGI, though the director can't really be blamed for this. Other than that, we are definitely entertained.

(Braveheart had neither of these issues, so it gets an A+ while Gladiator just gets an A).

12 February 2007,A brilliant epic movie! Beautiful film!,"Gladiator is really an excellent film. In every aspect this film is very good! This film is visually stunning, but also the story and the dialogs are good and interesting. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast do a very good job! Director Ridley Scott made an excellent film! Also the music is beautiful, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is amazing. Also the cinematography is excellent. This is an epic film that is excellent from beginning to end! Everyone must see this masterpiece! I've heard there are some historical mistakes in it, but I certainly didn't notice them, and even if there would be inaccuracies, they don't harm the film! A beautiful film!

2 July 2001,Why does everyone think this movie is so good?,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about this movie. I mean, was I the only one who noticed how crappy the screenplay was? All right, there were some good special effects, but that's about it.

I cannot believe that Gladiator even got a best picture nomination, let alone the oscar. That has to be the biggest travesty ever in oscar history (even bigger than Shakespeare in Love beating out Saving Private Ryan in 1998). I know that Dreamworks had to have at least one best picture nomination, but why didn't they push Almost Famous? It was such a better movie than Gladiator. I think Almost Famous was actually one of the top five movies of the year, and it would have made much more sense if Dreamworks has pushed that movie instead of Gladiator.

I guess I'll compromise and say that I don't disagree with Ridley Scott getting a Best Director nomination (only because he got a DGA nomination), and I thought Russell Crowe was pretty good as the Gladiator, so I won't protest his nomination, either. But other than that, Gladiator did not deserve any other major nomination. The most appalling one is best original screenplay. What was the Academy thinking? And what was up with Joaquin Phoenix's nomination? There were so many more deserving supporting roles this year, like Michael Douglas in Traffic and Mark Ruffalo in You Can Count On Me.

All I can say is that I've lost all confidence in the Oscars. It's not about the quality of the film anymore, what counts nowadays is the campaign. It's such a shame...........",1
7 June 2021,A masterpiece!!,"""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."" 21 years later, this movie is one of the best movies ever made! Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are brilliant!!

17 July 2000,All the cliches ever made up rolled into one movie,"My girlfriend had heard several great reviews from her friends so i had to be dragged to see 'gladiator', even though i had a very bad feeling about it.. Well, all my expectations were met, every cliche in the book was there and the worst part was that they were not even performed well. The whole movie tries very hard to radiate grandeur and epic heroism but it just totally fails. Acting was crap, most actors were statues talking without intonation while Crowe walked around the whole movie looking worried and silly and not like the heroic general he was supposed to be.. Music was junk (didn't expect it at all from Hans Zimmer, normally excellent..). The whole movie just didn't have the atmosphere it could have had. If you wanna see a good movie with Crowe watch The Insider (far better music too, incidentally also by Lisa Gerrard who did Gladiator together with Zimmer).

8 October 2006,Another overrated hasbeen of a movie . . .,"I cannot believe that this film continues to ""earn"" an 8.1 rating, unless, of course, you factor in the promo/hype, not to mention the Oscar thing. Ridley Scott needs n0 apologies, especially considering the likes of his ""Duelists""?, but the total corniness and gallery-getting antics of this film are laughable. Some cable channel reran this turkey a couple nights ago, and I watched a few scenes again, and marvelled at how Hollywood-can=you-get? in this day and age of relative realities, on screen and off. The ""character"" castings, of course, were par for the corny course, but, to me at least, neither Russell Crown nor Joaqu;in Phoenix could invest his character with anything but schmaltz. Schmalz That too. Well, at least Oliver Reed had a final ball as a slave owner?

17 January 2007,Russell Crowe's Best,"Gladiator is Russell Crowe's best performance ever. This movie was well directed by Ridley Scott. This is one of Ridley Scott's best films. I think Russell Crowe did a good job and Joaquin Phonix did a good job. This movie great acting, great writing, great cinematography, great sets and great costumes. This movie had great battle sequences. This film won an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Visual Effects. It got nominated for Best Supporting Actor - Joaquin Phonix, Best Art Direction - Arthur Max, Best Original Score - Hans Zimmer and Best Cinematography - John Mathison. I like other Ridley Scott films including Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise and Black Hawk Down.

15 June 2003,"The three good points of ""Gladiator""","1. Derek Jacobi: I love Derek Jacobi and he is one of the world's most brilliant actors. However, seeing him perform in such a lowbrow, low-class, low-quality movie is disturbing. It's a bit like seeing John Cleese in James Bond films or Kenneth Branagh in ""Wild Wild West."" It's sad, really.

2. Sets and costuming: This film is visually stunning. I suppose Ridley Scott has to be given credit for his work here instead of being blamed for a bad script.

3. It ends (and this one takes far too long to happen)

""Gladiator"" is almost as over-hyped as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Titanic"" in the pantheon of bad movies that somehow convinced idiots that they were good. Russell Crowe's performance is decent, but how in the world can you win a best actor Oscar for playing a completely flat, empty character like Maximus? Kevin Costner or Keanu Reeves can play a role this simple and do a decent job! It is possible to add some depth to this character in performance, but Crowe seems incapable, unwilling, or unallowed to do this and thus instead plays this one-dimensional piece-of-paper role and somehow gets accolades for it.

However, the part of this film that kills it is the thing that truly makes or breaks a film: the script. A good script can make up for bad acting (as evidenced in ""JFK"" and ""The Matrix""), but good acting cannot make up for a truly bad script (as evidenced in ""Best in Show"" and ""Titanic""). ""Gladiator"" is a case of the latter. Crowe doesn't give an amazing performance, but he is given little to work with. In fact, the only actor who really does have a full character to work with is Joaquin Phoenix, and he performs it quite well. The other characters hardly need acting, even though one is filled by the ever-brilliant Derek Jacobi. The truth of the matter, though, is that the script is trite and stupid. As a matter of fact, it's like a very ineloquent version of ""The Tragedy of King Richard III"" without the fascinating central character. There is also far too much battling in this film. I got bored with Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" because of ONE long battle scene, but this film seems to have about five of that same length. ""Gladiator"" is like all of these ""crime dramas"" that are really just action films with just enough plot for stupid people to think they are intelligent.

In sum, if you want to watch a typical, run-of-the-mill action film set in ancient Rome, watch this. If you want to see nothing other than stunning visuals, watch this (though I would more suggest that you watch anything directed by Peter Weir if you want visuals). However, if you want to see a movie worth watching, don't bother.",2
8 May 2000,Entertaining epic,"I can't say I'm a real big fan of what is known as the ""sword and sandal"" genre. Admittedly, I haven't seen too many of these medieval epics, but I can only think of two I liked(not counting Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, which spoofed the genre); BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS. The former, despite an annoying lead performance by Charlton Heston, had taste and craftsmanship, the latter, despite a somewhat one-note performance by Kirk Douglas, had irony and intelligence. The others all seemed melodramatic. But Ridley Scott's new film shows there's life in this genre yet.

Admittedly, the film does suffer in comparison in one respect; Scott seems less comfortable with the talking scenes and the backroom politics, as it were, than, say, Stanley Kubrick was in SPARTACUS. All the scenes with Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov were, in that film, equally as compelling as the battle scenes. Whereas in Scott's film, while he's cast some good actors like Joaquim Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Derek Jacobi, and they respond with good performances(in particular, Phoenix, an underrated actor, and not the obvious choice as the bad guy), you can sense his need to get back to the action.

Fortunately, the action is all well done; while it's clear Scott is trying to have it both ways(make entertaining spectacle which comments on the need for entertaining spectacle), he stages it so well we don't tend to worry about that. Also, he's helped mightily by the casting of Russell Crowe in the lead role. Crowe couldn't play a false note if he tried, and he brings a lot to a pretty standard action hero here. As with THE INSIDER, he's playing another person who takes a stand he didn't think he had to, and he leads by example, rather than bluster. Overall, while I'm not a big fan of the genre, this is a fine example of it.",8
14 May 2000,"great action, no heart. (SPOILERS)","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",5

Personally if you like gladiator movies watch a true masterpiece, like Ben Hur ( that actually utilizes a real set) Sparticus, Or Airplane.

26 March 2013,Tell me your masculine name.,"The film that invigorated the swords and sandals genre once more. To not threaten the brevity of the review by repeating what everybody else already knows, i will sum up Gladitor by writing these words: An epic revenge film set in Roman days.

If it's facts your looking for ( and god bless you if so) then don't get upset when history has blatantly been rewritten in order to escalate the viewers enjoyment of the excellent story.

This film could easily of ended up being cheesy but thankfully everyone pulls of their roles. R.Scott couldn't of shot it any better. Plenty of action for the bloody-thirsty folks and the main character probably has the coolest name in movie history.

Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
27 November 2005,Joaquin Phoenix Perfect For Roman Ceasar Roles,"Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect Roman Emperor for portraying any of the Roman Ceasars in a continuation of the mini series ""Rome"" or another movie about Emperor ruled Rome. The viewers loved the series Rome and would embrace seeing Joaquin Phoenix play Ceasar again. His demeanor, physical features, and intensity make him the perfectly credible Ceasar. Unforgettable, unmistakable regal presence.

His portrayal of Commodus in The Gladiator proved this. Ceasar is the role that Joaquin Phoenix was born to play. Would be a serious mistake if a producer in Hollywood does not recognize this.

Bring back Rome...and Joaquin Phoenix as Ceasar.

The story line was fairly simple, but so well done. The cast suited the roles , the acting was excellent and the cinematography was wonderful. What can be said that hasn't already? This is a film I'd watch again and again and again..........

22 December 2000,Yet another over-rated classic,"Whenever a new Ridley Scott movie appears, I can hardly contain my indifference. He's way too variable in terms of quality for me to get excited about a new release: Alien is a great movie, Thelma and Louise is nothing special, White Squall is pants, and G.I. Jane was surprisingly good, but I'm the only person who seems to think so. With this track record, as I walked into Gladiator I was less expectant than Adam Sandler on Oscar night. It turned out to be worse than I thought.

Gladiator is an epic-by-numbers. Sweeping shots over cities, a couple of thousand extras wearing togas, a few seconds in a battle scene where the music turns to silence and the direct-o-matic uses a different shutter speed... Seen it all before. While everyone else was dropping their jaws, my thumbs got busy with the twiddling.

If you're going to make a movie where the audience can root for the underdog, you should at least blur the lines a little. Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained. For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe. He gets fired from his job, sentenced to death, manages to escape only to find his wife raped and his children murdered, is sold into slavery, forced to perform in front of bloodthirsty crowds as a gladiator, loses his car keys and steps on a dog poo. For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth. It's as balanced as a see-saw with Jabba the Hutt on one end and Calista Flockhart on the other.

It has pretensions above the action movie it knows it really is, and it's at those points that the film moves from boring to laughable. We're told, over and over again, that gladiator fights are brutal, that the crowds are disgusting for watching, and that the men are unwilling to take part. It was at this point I phoned Amnesty International to see what we could do to stop this barbaric sport. Are we really learning anything by this? It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious. While the viewers are weeping at the injustice of it all, they're also excited by Crowe's muscular heroics, and the slo-mo, pop-promo style used for the bloody fight scenes. We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator. Is he the only one fighting against his will, or are the people he kills innocent victims too? Who cares? We've moved past the pathos now, we're on to the fight scenes. Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.

The ending is as predictable as possible. Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power? The only good thing about the ending was that it actually had one. Three weeks into the movie I was starting to have my doubts. Overlong, over-rated, add it to the list of undeserving modern classics.",4
6 May 2000,Too much,"What was Ridley Scott thinking? Gladiator is too long and the script tried to be too many things for too many people. Use one of those swords to whack off about two-thirds of the Commodus- is-a-really-smarmy-guy scenes and you've got something there. Russell Crowe was outstanding and the soldier who just wants to go home storyline was pleasing. Somehow, though, this one left me thinking Rambo with togos.

27 May 2000,Just short of a masterpiece,"This is a terrific movie which combines fantastic action, a good plot and one of the finest leading characters seen in a long time into a undeniable classic. Russell Crowe's casting as Maximus is perfect and he produces a magnificent performance as the invincible Roman General who's nobility, honour and fearless composure in all things win over everyone. He is a born leader and warrior who has only one dream: to defeat all who oppose his Emperor and to retire back to his Spanish farm with his wife and son. When those things are taken from him by the ruthless Commodus his initial welcoming of death becomes tempered as he sees a way to return vengeance upon those who have destroyed him. Ridley Scott deserves most of the congratulations as it is he who once again delivers us the kind of movie he is capable of making, beautiful, graphic but above all else utterly absorbing. The special effects and the music are amazing and serve to draw you completely into the film as its story unfolds and not once do you find yourself thinking 'Nah, that didn't look real'. If they had to complete some of Oliver Reed's scenes without the great man then the join is invisible and goes to show exactly how well the money was spent. Without a doubt THE summer blockbuster of 2000.",10

5 May 2000,An high quality picture,"This movie is very excellent on the visual side. The images are great and the directing is awesome. In acting, I was impressed by Joaquin Phoenix in the role of the evil Commodus. He is really evil. Russell Crowe as the physic to prove his talent. And it's very great to see the old Richard Harris in a comeback.

A great epic!!!

11 August 2023,An epic...,"I sat down to watch the 2000 movie ""Gladiator"" again here in 2023, making it a couple of times to have watched it since it was released. And the movie actually does have a good amount of replay value to it, so the script and storyline is nicely written.

The storyline, as written by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson is a rather nicely written one. It is an interesting storyline and script with many aspects to it, and that makes it a very enjoyable movie to sit through. And I dare say that there is something for just about everyone in the audience to enjoy here.

The movie also has a great cast ensemble, with some very good talents. You are in very capable hands with the likes of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Richard Harris, Ralf Moeller, Tommy Flanagan, Sven-Ole Thorsen and others at the helm. Good performances from the actors and actresses really helped bring the story to life on the screen.

Visually, then ""Gladiator"" is quite a nice movie. Lots of attention to detail, and it looked and felt like a time era movie. Thumbs up to the props and wardrobe department for that.

If you haven't enjoyed the epic that is ""Gladiator"" yet, then you most certainly should do so, if you get the chance. It is a rather entertaining movie.

The talk about making a sequel to this 2000 movie is just absurd. The movie ended on a great note, and there really is no point in resurrecting the movie, especially not with Maximus in the movie.

My rating of director Ridley Scott's 2000 movie ""Gladiator"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8
24 October 2019,Amazingly powerful movie from start to finish.,"As far as film making goes, you probably can't top this. The practical effects are amazing, the stunts are amazing and just the overall astatic is even better. Hans Zimmer also provides what is in my opinion one of his best ever scores, which just make the fight scenes even more entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix also gives what is probably his best performance ever, and definitely deserved an Oscar for it. Russell Crowe, although great in the movie, seems to have play his character on one note, making it a mystery how he got one and Joaquin didn't. Another issue is that although it's entertaining, all the enjoyment is on the surface, so it's not the sort of movie you'll be thinking about a lot afterwards. Still a great classic.

7 January 2004,"An overrated, grotesque commentary on the 'Civilized' Romans and the folks who love to watch them","I suppose that any movie with excessive violence and a passable soundtrack can now officially qualify as 'great' in our society, so it should come as no surprise that 'Gladiator' is critically renowned. Still, did we have to witness a grinning seven year old boy being trampled ruthlessly by horsemen? Did we have to hear the line ""They tell me your son squealed like a girl as he was nailed to the cross, and that your wife moaned like a whore as she was ravaged over... and over... and over again?"" Thank you, Ridley Scott.

It's sad that people are so casually able to dismiss stomach-churning moments such as these in the film...for what? For a supposed hero's hollow 'vengeance' that may or may not ever come to fruition? For Russell Crowe's rugged (cough) good looks? Whatever the reason, it's bad enough that the average audience continues to have such a fascination with 'bloodlust', but that gratuitous violence towards children (even though fictionalized) now passes as part of the overall entertainment package...what does that say about us as a society?",1

8 December 2000,Biggest Disappointment EVER,"I ordered this movie in a hotel room for 10 dollars in hopes that I would be watching a possible Best Picture nominee. Instead, I watched a confusing, poorly executed excuse for a movie. The first war scene's camera angles and overall layout had me wondering who was who. I hope other people did not have to pay 10 dollars to watch such a disappointment.

6 June 2000,This movie kicked my butt!,"""Gladiator"" is a very simple story. Most of the time, it is a typical war hero adventure. Sometimes it even appears stupid. The plot is not very complex and gets repetitive. The hero kills because he must and that is enough reason for him. He wants to avenge the death of his wife and his kid so he will plow through his enemies until he gets to the man responsible. When he does, he will save the day and all will be well. There are a bunch of other war adventure cliches in between the major plot events. Normally, no matter how compelling the story is, a simple war film will not win me over 100 percent. Although ""Gladiator"" is very one-dimensional and predictable at times, it surpasses other similar movies. Many elements contributed to grasp my attention and have me surrender to this adventure.

As I said the story is simple. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) has just led Rome to yet another victory and the empire has expanded once again. The Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a dying man doubting what he has achieved for his people. Since he has such a close bond with his general he decides to change his mind and ask Maximus to become the next Caesar instead of Marcus Aurelius' incompetent son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus is a simple warrior that only wants one thing: to go home. He knows the exact number of days he has not seen his family. Although he loves Marcus Aurelius, he cannot imagine himself as the next leader of Rome. For that reason, Marcus Aurelius wants him to take over and bring happiness back to the people. As Maximus ponders whether to accept the offer, Commodus finds out about his father's decision. He is heart-broken and jealous and in his rage he murders his father. Quickly he announces himself as the next Caesar. Because Maximus is suspicious and not willing to serve his new leader, Commodus has him arrested and orders an execution. Similarly, he orders Maximus' family to be killed as well. While Maximus escapes, his loved ones are murdered and his house is burned down. The exiled general is eventually captured and bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) who trains him and many others to be gladiators in a smaller province outside of Rome. Maximus quickly steals the hearts of many spectators and becomes their favorite. Back in Rome, the power hungry Commodus decides to bring gladiator games back to the people of Rome and so a confrontation between the young Caesar and Maximus is evident.

Ridley Scott's direction sells this story. He uses dark lighting and vast settings to create a similar tone to the one in ""Blade Runner."" The darker mood is great in ""Gladiator."" Not all hero adventures such as this one have to maintain a mostly positive atmosphere. The storytelling is overwhelmingly powerful and very compelling. Dynamic cinematography is effectively used during all major battles and gladiator fights. The music is excellent. It just screams out at you. This simple tale is transformed into the most interesting and engaging picture of this year. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. He portrays courage, honor, and anger with a warrior's mentality. His repetitive drive for vengeance is forgotten in the way this film is presented. Joaquin Phoenix is even better as Commodus. This is a confused man that wants power, but doesn't know how to get it or what to do with it. He expresses jealousy in sight of anyone who is more loved than he is. That is why he hates Maximus. He believes his father loved Maximus more than he loved him. He wants to feel love from the people of Rome; therefore he will do anything to please them. He wants to be loved by his sister, more than a sister should love her brother. He forces these things and they confuse him. Commodus is in pain and is blind to what he is doing. Ridley Scott makes sure Commodus' eyes are never quite visible in the film. They are always encircled by darkness or make-up. This is exactly the type of character that would be present in the future world of ""Blade Runner."" Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy.

Because of the performances, the beautiful music, the dark lighting, and the energetic cinematography the simple story of ""Gladiator"" evolves into an overpowering film. It's good to see a film set in a darker moodier ancient Rome instead of another World War II epic. It's also great to see a movie with so much energy and power that it makes you forget about its simple storyline. Many beautiful sequences in ""Gladiator"" make this film an unbelievable experience. It is tremendous and seems larger than life. ""Gladiator"" is better than, say, ""Braveheart"" simply because of its raw power. ""Braveheart"" was a great adventure that just wasn't enough in comparison. ""Gladiator"" is exceptional and surpasses other smarter films in the genre simply because of its overwhelming presence! It will absorb you with all its might. This film might be overlooked during the Oscars because it is another war epic, but hopefully it will get some recognition. ""Gladiator"" achieves greatness in its dark powerful storytelling and great direction by Ridley Scott. It will be one of the best films of the year. Thank you for making a predictable story burst out as if it was so much more. This movie kicks ass! Overall, a 10 out of 10!",10
30 May 2000,Historical Euphemism par excellence,"Watching this movie has caused me to once again wonder, how a director can manage to create images of perfect beauty, while producing such a horrible plot and dialogues that almost make me blush for just hearing them at the same time. I thought the 90s had finally brought movies with such appalling heroic pathos to an end. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Not only does Ridley Scott make usually excellent actors bring forth lines that let ""The Phantom Menace"" ring like Shakespeare in my ears. He also shows no scruples whatsoever twisting history around entirely and making the Roman Empire look like a benevolent pacifier. All in all, if it weren't for a few corrupt Senators and a megalomaniac young emperor, Rome seems to have had no flaws for Scott whatsoever. Ah, a little genocide here, some imperialism there...the others were all ""barbarians"" anyway. The only thing that really surprised me was that Russell Crowe was not draped by a flag at the end...oh, wait, that movie was about Rome, not about America, wasn't it? My mistake!

There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10

29 September 2020,Honor and Strength.,"This movie is successful in showing us how to put these words into action. All of the lines and actions are ""in accord"" with this code. This is how the Roman Empire was build on. Excellent performance of the duo, trying to overcome the other in and out the movie, always with these words to count for. I wouldn't rate this a straight 10, since in my opinion, the trama could be more developed around his vengeance and could have take another way that would be interesting to see. Although that, totally deserved of the Academy Awards, and i would say that could've sincerely won the original score award, with an honourable score from Mr. Hans Zimmer, matching the expectations of an ""epoch drama"" from the ancient times.

16 April 2021,Gladiator,"This movie is in my top 10, maybe my top 5. This movie is timeless, the acting is unmatched, and the action is great. It single-handedly brought back the historic epic, which at that point was thought of as just old movies from the 60s.

29 May 2000,Excellent!,"I almost loved everything about this movie, accept Joaquim Phoenix (alias Commodus). I really hated it in the first hour of the film when he came in the picture, his acting was really horrible. But, the last 40 minutes he did a better job. The fightscenes were the best I've ever seen and I never did feel bored during the movie. I was pleased that in the movie the fightscenes didn't play a leading role. The story was excellent but a bit clich√© at the end. It wasn't that hard to find out how it was going to end. The film's score was good, but not the whole time, but that's I think a matter of taste. I hope Russell Crowe will get an Oscar and that this movie will be nominated a lot of times. Great!!!!!!

3 May 2019,All time Classic !!!!,"One of those all time classics that reshaped the genre when it was all but dead. Crowe is splendid in the lead role and commands the screen in a role he was born to play. Ridley Scott returns to form after a few films fail to find critical or financial success. The film swept the box office and awards so, the film plays out like an artistic big budget passion of love. This is one film I haven't tired from after all these years and have just recently experienced the extended cut, I think studios should allow 3 hour films as a standard practice. I cannot fault what I might even call my favourite film of all time.

8 December 2000,Not Quite Braveheart,"Not quite Sparticus either. An entertaining effort as I was not bored and this was a long movie. The ending was pure Hollywood and that was the big separation from Braveheart (Sparticus too).

Braveheart ended how it had to, how it would have in real life. Sparticus showed the brutality, the way things were. Gladiator was fluffy Hollywood.

Entertaining. Worth a look. Not a classic.

2 March 2021,My third viewing,"It is in the writing where the problems are, but also in the cinematography. Here the writing veers off course. The offshoots stop the flow. The character of Joaquin Phoenix wants to marry his sister. It is a fact that Romans and Greeks married their relatives, but in an action film this diverts the energy flow. It is too big to put into an action film. When Phoenix describes the deaths of the gladiator's wife and son; the action is stopped. Scripts that have power are unstoppable trains. The camera work is dark throughout. There is a haze over every scene of unfocused surroundings. Computer generated stadium and battle scenes are over used and lack sharpness. The sword fight between Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix looks unchoreographed and dangerous to the actors. Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, and he wasn't given the lines to show his amazing ability; that is the writing. I didn't like the ending. When you watch this film three times, you might agree.

13 July 2007,Only superlatives can describe the Gladiator,"This movie is simply excellent. Ridley Scott did something in directing we have been waiting for since Alien. Phenomenal camera work, passionate motions, colourful landscapes, lifelike wounds and a wonderful casting. Hans Zimmer composed amazing music from the beginning to the end of the film. Furthermore, that Enya song, Now We Are Free, is one of the most expressing soundtrack for me in film history. All the fights were perfect and dynamic, and the costumes and helmets...everything just at its potential!

Russell Crowe deserved his Oscar, his performance and his victory are such an incomparable ones I have not seen on the screen before. He represents all in his actions that I want to become. Through his moral, he gives an unforgettable memory to me that I am very grateful for, indeed. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was a great choice but he still has to wait for his Oscar, though he did an amazing job as well.

11 OUT OF 10 or 6* OUT OF 5* is my final judgement.

Thank you Russell Crowe, well done!",10
8 May 2000,Way too drawn out,"Gladiator was a severe disappointment to me. Firstly, it was too long, at least 45 minutes too long; 2h45m total. But length alone doesn't make a movie seem long. In fact, some movies that are very long don't seem very long at all, such as the Lawrence of Arabia, the Godfather movies and Braveheart, all riveting throughout. No, Gladiator's problem was that it was obviously going for the look and feel of an epic. It got the look just right. No question, this movie looked fantastic; can't possibly give an argument there. Unfortunately, the film didn't have enough story for an epic. Solution? To have long stretches of dialogue and to have long pauses between each line of dialogue which, by the way, was very, very bad. The acting, therefore, was understandably average as no actor could possibly seem that convincing behind such overblown dialogue.

3 January 2022,This an an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see,"Gladiator (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix over the holidays with my family. The storyline follows a Spanish military leader whose land is conquered, family destroyed and he's left to become a Gladiator in the ring for entertainment for Italian nobles. He decides to use his position as a Gladiator as an opportunity to gain revenge on those who harmed his family.

This movie is directed by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and stars Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind), Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Connie Nielsen (Wonder Woman), Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond), Tommy Flanagan (Braveheart), Richard Harris (Unforgiven) and Oliver Reed (The Brood).

The storyline for this is very well told from beginning to end. You quickly become engulfed in the characters and find Crowe easy to root for and Phoenix easy to despise. The cinemategrophy and landscapes are beautiful and the depiction of the time, era and way of life is perfect. The action scenes are mesmerizing and you quickly become overwhelmed by the meticulous details that went into every battle scene - the elements, the gore and the intensity are brilliantly depicted.

Overall this an an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.",10
10 January 2011,To my wife... none of your business,"In AD 180, after his family(his son and the mother of said kid) are murdered, Maximus(I guess they didn't want to be completely overt and go with Biggus) seeks revenge over the man who also stole the position of ruler of Rome from him; Commodus, who they try really hard to make a villain out of. The acting is marvelous, with Crowe, Phoenix and Reed(R.I.P.) bringing their roles to life. All characters are credible and well-developed. The fighting, although apparently not consistent with reality of how they were trained, is really cool; they're of varying length with nice choreography. They're covered in close-ups and with hand-held, which really gives them a sense of intensity. The scope is epic, and this is realistic and authentic, giving you a feel of how it was back then. This has well-done FX, you basically can't tell the CGI from the real. The photography is excellent, with really impressive visuals. Dialog is fine. It is a tad Hollywood, as the overall thing is. Honestly, I would rate Spartacus higher than this. Kirk has gravitas far beyond that of Russell, the battles are *unforgettable* and powerful, the interplay between the people is heartfelt and rings true(and pays off), and the story is simply more inspirational(slave rises up against his master, early human rights campaign... this is just ""I'm going to get back what I lost or get payback for it"", and could have been set any other time or place). Still, a solid 142 minutes sans credits. There is a lot of disturbing content and bloody violence. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary track by the director, the DOP and the editor. 8/10",8
6 June 2000,A solid 7,"This is a good movie, not a great movie. Better to see on the big screen, and it is worth the 8.50 I paid for. I am a follower of history, and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or hollywood or politically correct film, in order to have a believable script. It did, the story was a little hollywood, but gave a good description of the brutality, and views of the time. I will not spoil the story, but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play, with revenge being the main motivator in the story line. This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time, and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy. A good epic. The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic, and the action is done with perfection. It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day, because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film. The film wasn't too long either, and that is good considering how long it was. I gave it a 7 maybe, because it didn't grab me, but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more.

14 February 2010,"Rather good action adventure, not sure if it was really an Oscar caliber film.","This film was released in the summer of 2000 and was a bit more of a film than your typical summer blockbuster. However, I am a bit surprised it won the Oscar award that year mainly because as it is not in its entirety your typical summer blockbuster it has most of the elements of one. It has a lot of action and a lot of blood, granted there is some story to it that makes it a step above mindless summer popcorn film. The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like ""300"", the entire Matrix trilogy, ""Hannibal"" (hell this one wasn't even a good movie"", and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are ""Titanic"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"". This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.",8

6 November 2021,"Now that you mention it, I am entertained","Here's an odd case of a somewhat forgotten blockbuster (Best Picture winner, no less). I remember seeing Gladiator in the theater; it was huge. And then . . . Poof. No one talked about it.

I guess that's why I wasn't expecting much from it today, but that's a clear underestimation. I was enthralled by the battle scenes and absorbed by this man's tragic story. To that end, Russell Crowe is an excellent choice for this noble-to-a-fault general; he's charismatic, wounded and I honestly believed he had it out for Joaquin Phoenix for real. That revenge thirst is nothing to sneeze at.

I was interrupted at one point, and actually kinda pissed that I'd have to wait to finish it. That's how you know the movie's a winner.

3 November 2004,Excellent Revival of the Epic Tradition,"One of the strange aspects of cinematic history is how an entire genre of films can suddenly lose favour and disappear. In the fifties and early sixties big historical epics, with story lines normally drawn either from the Bible or from classical antiquity, were one of the most popular types of film, and their popularity seemed assured after the huge successes of 'Ben-Hur' in 1959 and 'Spartacus' the following year. A few years later, however, they all but disappeared from the screen after the financial failures of 'Cleopatra' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. The genre seemed to be dead and gone; when the film-makers of the late sixties, seventies and eighties made films on a large scale, they generally turned to other subject-matter (often organised crime or science fiction).

What is gone, however, is not always gone for ever. The nineties saw, at least on a limited scale, revivals of a number of genres which had seemed to be in decline- the Western ('Dances with Wolves'), the mediaeval history lesson ('Braveheart'), the big-scale disaster movie ('Titanic'), the war film ('Saving Private Ryan') until, finally, it was the turn of the classical epic. Ridley Scott chose to revive the genre by starting where 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' had left off thirty-six years earlier, with the story of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus.

The two films have a similar plot. Both start with Marcus Aurelius leading the Roman legions to victory over the German tribes on the Empire's northern frontier. In each case he is assisted by an able second-in-command (called Livius in the earlier film, Maximus in the later). In each case the Emperor has doubts about the fitness of his son, Commodus, to succeed him, but is murdered before he can put into practice a scheme to prevent his son's accession. Commodus proves to be a tyrannical ruler, and the second half of each film deals with the struggle between the evil Emperor and his late father's friend, who represents the forces of good. In 'Gladiator', Maximus also has a personal motive to seek revenge, because Commodus was responsible for the murders of his wife and young son. He himself survives an attempt by Commodus to have him killed, but he is sold into slavery and forced to become a gladiator. (There are parallels here with another Roman epic, 'Spartacus'). Maximus's skill with weapons ensures that he quickly rises to the top of his new profession, and when his troupe is taken to Rome to fight in the Coliseum he sees an opportunity for revenge.

The older classical epics were noted for spectacle, and 'Gladiator' is a worthy successor in this regard. The opening battle between the Romans and the Germans and the scenes of combat in the arena are both vivid and exciting. It does not, however, rely on spectacle alone. Like the more distinguished of the earlier epics (especially 'Spartacus') it contains some very good acting performances. Russell Crowe, as Maximus, shows that he has, like Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston, the commanding presence to take centre stage in a film of this nature. He brought out both Maximus's physical courage and his nobility, and his 'best actor' award was well-deserved. Oliver Reed, in his final film, was also good as the gladiator trainer Proximo, as was Richard Harris as the ageing Emperor Aurelius (although I preferred Alec Guinness's interpretation of the same role in 'Fall of the Roman Empire'). Joaquin Phoenix brought an original touch to the role of Commodus, portrayed as a basically weak and petulant young man rather than a ranting tyrant. His cruelty arises from his sense of weakness and insecurity.

Both 'Gladiator' and 'Fall of the Roman Empire' are, to some extent, historically inaccurate. All the evidence, for example, suggests that Marcus Aurelius died of natural causes, and he does not seem to have entertained any doubts about his son's fitness to rule. (It is not, however, a goof, as some have claimed, to show Commodus fighting in the arena; there is historical evidence that he did so on many occasions). The politics of 'Gladiator', with its preference for republicanism over monarchism, seem to reflect modern American values rather than Roman ones. The distinction between a republic and a monarchy was not as clear-cut then as it is now. The Romans, even when they were ruled by an Emperor, continued to refer to their state as 'res publica', and the Emperor never claimed to be a king. (The title 'Rex' was never used during this period; the Latin title 'Imperator' literally means 'Commander'). Succession from father to son was not automatic; the accession of Commodus was the first time in over a hundred years that an Emperor had been succeeded by his natural, as opposed to adopted, son. If Aurelius had really wanted to disinherit Commodus, he could have done so by adopting some distinguished Senator or military leader as his successor. (Aurelius himself was no blood-relation to his predecessor Antoninus Pius). It seems unlikely that he would have wanted to abolish the office of Emperor and replace it with direct rule by the Senate (which was an oligarchy, not a democratically elected Parliament).

I was not, however, too worried by this; 'Gladiator' is by no means the only historic drama to look at the past through the eyes of the present. (Indeed, it is probably impossible when making such a film to avoid this trap altogether). 'Spartacus', for example, projected modern ideas about political freedom back to ancient Rome, and 'The Egyptian' had the people of ancient Egypt practising a quasi-Christian religion more than a millennium before the birth of Christ. The epic tradition had been allowed to languish for too long. Ridley Scott showed, in this intelligent and visually striking film, that it was possible to revive it with success, a revival that has continued with 'Troy' this year and 'Alexander the Great' to come next year. I should also mention Hans Zimmer's excellent musical score, which seems well on the way to becoming a modern classic. 8/10",8

29 June 2001,"An old-fashioned hero, brilliantly portrayed","There isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said, but what made this movie so special for me was Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of Maximus as a genuine hero of Shakespearean proportions. I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device. It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero. Crowe does both. The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails. In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link. In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes. I can't believe that so many prolonged grisly scenes were necessary to get the movie's point across.",9
18 April 2023,Gladiator,"This has got just about everything from ""Spartacus"" (1960) to ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) via a bit of ""Quo Vadis"" (1951) to it - and Ridley Scott has managed to create a magnificent spectacle of a film. Russell Crowe is the eponymous soldier ""Maximus"". Commander of the Armies of the Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor - until, that is, the emperor's son ""Commodus"" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his sister ""Lucilla"" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it's all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning ""Proximo"" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics, betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie as ""Maximus"" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day. Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in Hollywood.",8
16 August 2002,a battle to get through,"This must be the most overrated film of the last 30 years. I have sat through the idolisation of David Finscher, the rise of Michael Bay, and ""The Matrix"" becoming the philosopher-film of my generation, but I draw the line in the blood-soaked sand at the attention given to this movie. Three hours long when it should have been 90 minutes, the film has little to go for it apart from Russell Crowe's glower and a wash of grainy CGI effects. I will never understand how Joaquin Phoenix, who is a descent actor (Just watch ""To Die For"") managed to get an Oscar nomination for aping Malcom McDowell's performance in ""Caligula."" Am I really supposed to feel touched when Maximus returns to see his family dead; a scene from countless better films? If that is enough to move the hearts of people these days, than for God's sake send me back to the silent era.

Rent Spartacus instead

26 June 2019,my notes,"Great movie. awesome story. great acting. makes you feel the characters emotions. lots of memorable scenes. good music. my only issue with the movie is the way the fights were filmed with lots of shaky cam and quick cuts that made it hard to really see what was happening. the overall action scenes were great but the fighting not so much (2 viewings)

7 April 2012,skin and soul of a world,"a story. without limits. glamorous, exotic, precise in each detail, heroic, vast, full of brilliance, emotions and fights at every level. a movie about Rome but in different way. because may be a love declaration or homage. because action is part of feeling storm. because a basic tale, common, out of extraordinary elements is so magnificent! the bad, the good and impressive arena. American values as crumbs of a great epic. and Rusell Crow in one of his prestigious roles, Phoenix in skin of seductive bleak heroes. honor, freedom and revenge, friendship, love story and ladder of victory. a film like a commercial center because it is reflection of director, producer and cast to recreate not a story but a world with its soul. and result is the best.battles and conspiracy, courage and its nuances and fear in its shadow. a good movie ? may be. memorable ? of course!

15 August 2004,very enjoyable adventure,"Even though Russell Crow has gained an awful reputation as a spoiled actor, his delivery in Gladiator erases it all in my mind. His consistent and admirable work pull you completely into the screen and take you on a really fun, sad, and rewarding adventure.

The art direction in this film is superior. The camera, the script, and the direction are all examples of first class work. Yet, sadly I see that some people chose to rate it as an awful film...why? Nothing about this film is done badly. Could it be jealousy? Hatred? Why can't we just be happy about great work and celebrate with those who were responsible for making it? Russell, keep up the great work.

17 July 2005,Gladiator,"A action/drama based in Rome around the time of 180 a.d. about a man named Maximus(Russell Crowe,L.A.Confidential)Who is betrayed by the emperor Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix,The Yards)the emperor of Rome.Maximus and his wife and son are to be put to death but Maximus escapes his death yet his wife and son did not so the emperor Commodus assumes Maximus is dead but that is far from the truth.The truth is that he has been captured by a slave trader who sells him to a man named Proximo(Oliver Reed)who makes him a gladiator ""The Gladiator that defied a emperor"".

Russell Crowe(Maximus)Gives a electrifying performance as does Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus).Yet i found the young boy Spencer Treat Clark(Lucius)very very Annoying i cant quite say if it was his acting or the character that i found annoying maybe it was both.Ridley Scott as always flies pass the directing medium at the speed of sound.There are some extremely exciting battle sequences the gore was not out of control i really appreciate when a director can keep the gore under control now i am not saying there was no blood because there was but the way he showed the blood was quite classy.The music is extremely powerful making the movie very exciting.I really enjoyed the screenplay the actors worked very well off of each other.The storyline was very good i was only bored for a total of about 10 minutes out of the 2 hours and 35 minutes which is quite good.

Best actor/actress-Russell Crowe

A powerful experience-Jake Hyden

I gave this movie a 9 out of 10

Rated-(R) for intense, graphic combat

9/10",9
5 April 2021,WOW... 8.7/10 for me,"I saw this movie when I was Way too young. But still this movie is incredibly good.

It was well done, well acted, the camera shots were genius, the fight scenes were awesome but when I saw it I was scared because of all the beheadings.

But still GREAT movie.

13 January 2007,Ridley Scott shows his directing brilliance,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
27 March 2005,A very great movie!!,"This movie is one of the great true-to-the-human-heart movie. It has a good story and good ending. I enjoyed this movie so much that I recommended this movie to all my friends and even my teachers. Actually, my World Literature teacher liked it so much that she got permission to show it to our class. It has great actors in it as well. Joaquin Phoenix is hot and is perfect for the part of Commodus. He has the look and the acting attitude for the evil emperor. Russel Crowe is an awesome actor in anything that he is in. He also has his part down pat. I could not imagine anyone else playing the part of Maximus. I also like what Hans Zimmer did to the music for this film. I love the instruments and the word choices for the film. I am actually listening to the second soundtrack to the movie. I love the way the music reminds me of the different parts of the movie. I get the shivers just thinking about the ending music especially.

28 September 2004,History updated,"According to the brilliant but eccentric historian Gibbon, the succession of the philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius by his mad son Commodus marked the start of the decline of the Roman Empire. It was this event which provided the setting for Anthony Mann's 1960s film, 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', and 'Gladiator' is a modern reworking of the same story, with a hefty nod to Kubrick's 'Spartacus' as well. At first, what catches the attention is what's new in the film: the odd, Enya-esque soundtrack and the impressive, almost convincing but over-used computer generated animation (I mean, how many digitally-enhanced thunderstorms does one film need?). But behind the slickness, what's more noticeable is how firmly this film sits in the tradition of earlier Roman epics. I rather like this genre, as the inherent political and personal drama in these almost true stories is immense; though in 'Gladiator', some of the potential is lost through sentimentality and a tendency to reduce events to an elemental struggle of good and evil. Russell Crowe in particular, all honour and valour, is dull in the central role. But as is usual in films such as this, a clutch of talented British thespians lend some class to the project: in this case, Richard Griffiths, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and of course Oliver Reed, his magnificent eyes still wild with life (though he died before filming was complete). Overall, 'Gladiator' is a welcome addition to a canon that has lain untouched since 'Cleopatra'. What I'd really like to see, though, is a film of the life of Dicoletian, one of Gibbon's few heroes in the long tale of the dark years.",7
22 November 2000,Epic and spectacular.One of the best movies of the year.,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Watching Gladiator again on video is'nt the same experience as watching it on the big screen,especially my local UGC cinema,which Speilberg himself has personally recommended.There's much more to be savoured here than sound effects and enhanced picture scope,but all the same,the battle scenes in the collesium are of a calibre higher than anything ever seen before.Soaringly brilliant,they set the movie alight.Equally as sweeping is the performances.Richard Harris as the dying,judgemental father is inhabitually rendering,as is Russell Crowe himself as the main star of the show.Joaquin Phoneix as the corrupt second heir to the throne is snidily effective,Derek Jacobi gives a fruitfully vibrant performance as the loudspeaker of the collesium,and Oliver Reed invests a spirited final performance as the beleaguered slave owner.Djimon Hounsou is also unnoticably fine as Crowe's sidekick in the arena.Director Ridley Scott has produced many breathtaking craft designs in his films,but the soaring overview to the entrance of the collesium is one of his most profound and manevolent ever.The whole film works on every level it sets out to work on.Easily one of the most recommendable films of the year,this is best watched on a 32 inch screen in dolby pro logic to create as close a feeling to the cinema as you're ever going to get.*****",
19 August 2021,Epico !,"I guess the ""Epic"" movie must be this movie.

The acting is top level, the story is good, the music is fantastic.

Thank you Mr. Scott.

20 February 2016,An Extraordinary Feat Of Epic Filmmaking!,"Ancient Rome comes alive in breathtaking detail in Ridley Scott's historical epic that presents the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form for Gladiator is truly monumental in both scope of its ambition & scale of its production, is easily amongst the greatest spectacles to surface on the big screen, and is an extraordinary feat of its genre that not only scores high marks in its technical aspects but is equally accomplished in the storytelling department, thus succeeding as a masterpiece of epic filmmaking that delivers on all fronts.

The story of Gladiator follows Maximus Decimus Meridius, a loyal general who after leading the Roman army to victory in a decisive battle finds himself betrayed when Commodus (son of the Emperor) murders his father & takes the throne for himself. Arrested & sentenced to death, Maximus manages to escape but is unable to save his family and is then taken captive by slavers. Driven by retribution, the General who became a slave then trains as a gladiator and ultimately returns to Rome to avenge the murder of his family as well as his King.

Directed by Ridley Scott, Gladiator is the perfect exemplification of all his trademarks and is undoubtedly his finest output since the 1979 horror classic, Alien, for the level of detail in every frame of this fable is absolutely staggering. His direction also exhibits a much better control on the narrative elements than most of his works and for a historical drama, it is expertly paced. The screenplay packs in an interesting set of characters, their arc is methodically progressed, and despite the subplots related to supporting figures, the focus remains on Maximus throughout its runtime.

As far as elements of technical filmmaking go, Gladiator is nothing short of a marvel. Production design team does a magnificent job in putting up set pieces that are grand, imposing & meticulously refined with the real standout being the Colosseum itself which is undeniably a sight to behold. The culture, politics & life within the Roman Empire is illustrated in splendid detail. Costumes, artefacts & other props are in sync with the timeline its story is set in but it also incorporates a slightly urban touch to it that brings a flavour of its own into the picture and enhances the look & feel of the whole imagery.

Cinematography makes precise use of nearly all the techniques in the book at just the right moments whether it's the slow-mo shots, chaotic camera-work, time-lapse photography, panning shots, close-ups, zoom-ins & zoom-outs, and the reason why every bit of it works is because none of it is overused. Even the colour palette ranges from cold to warm tones, numerous filters are used for differentiating locations, and lighting is pitch-perfect. Editing provides a steady pace to the whole narrative plus the unfolding of events is effectively controlled considering that its 155 minutes of runtime never becomes an issue.

Visual effects team also deserves kudos for restoring the Colosseum to the glory of its heyday with CGI assistance but its use is still minimal for most of the effects in the picture are practical yet it all looks incredibly authentic. However, what really uplifts the entire experience and provides Gladiator its sense of grandness is Hans Zimmer's majestic score for it comprises of tracks that are rousing & resonant and effortlessly match the film's colossal magnitude. The best bits are saved for battle sequences but that doesn't mean the soundtrack isn't able to enrich other moments for it, as a whole, remains one of the most celebrated compositions of Zimmer's career.

Coming to the performances, Gladiator features a reliable cast in Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Richard Harris & others. Leading from the front is Crowe in what still remains his finest work to date. The ruggedness of his voice combined with the comfort Crowe exhibits in the skin of Maximus makes him a commanding figure worthy of respect and impressive enough for viewers to invest their emotions in. Phoenix is thoroughly committed to his role and makes up for an interesting antagonist. Nielson chips in with a terrific input to stand out in a cast filled with men while Reed, Jacobi & Hounsou play their given roles in a wise manner.

On an overall scale, Gladiator manages to live up to its larger- than-life story of a general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor and is thematically rich, technically accomplished & spectacularly entertaining from beginning to end. Ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, smartly edited, outstandingly scored & strongly performed, this epic is engaging from the first frame, is brought to life with great care & attention to detail, and benefits immensely from an assured filmmaker at helm. Holding back nothing, packed with memorable quotes and boasting many astounding moments over the course of its runtime, Gladiator is a cinematic treasure that's worthy of all its accolades. One hundred percent recommended.",

14 May 2017,Great entertainment,"Greetings from Lithuania.

As i guess there isn't a life form here on earth who somehow by now have missed this movie - i won't going to go into details and be as short here as possible.

""Gladiator"" (2000) is a great and superb entertainment in every possible way. From the excellent performances by literally everyone involved, from unforgettable and music so superb directing, set design, sound design, costumes - this is a highly entertaining and involving movie from the opening till tear-jerking closing scene. Sure there tons of historical inaccuracies (bizarre to say the least), but ""Gladiator"" shouldn't be seen as historical movie - this is a revenge story set in ancient Rome, and the story and its presentation is universal.

Overall, ""Gladiator"" is one of those movies which wherever you catch on TV you stay with it until the end. Superbly made, terrifically entertaining movie from star till finish, this is a must see.",10
26 January 2023,Gladiator - Best Film of 2000,"Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career in this historical epic about the corruption within the Roman Empire during the era of emperors and conquering heores, such as the general portrayed by Crowe. The emperor played by Joaquin Phoenix is also one of his best performances of all time as well (at least as good as The Joker). The battle sequences are impressive due to the great work done by the cinematographer, and the music is stirring as well.

This movie had all the bells and whistles needed to make it an eternal classic among the spectacles of Hollywood. Ridley Scott, the master of action sequences, shows why he has been crowned the emperor of action movies, as he directs this film flawlessly. Be sure to catch it.

1 December 2019,A solid and epic blockbuster that still impresses us today.,"This film is set in the golden age of the Roman Empire, at the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the early years of Emperor Commodus. Maximus is a brilliant Roman general, the favorite of the old emperor, who wishes to restore the Roman Republic and sees in his successor a project of bloodthirsty tyrant. However, Commodus manages to kill his father and succeed him before he carries out his plans, becoming absolute lord of Rome and orders to kill Maximus and all his family. Trapped and sold into slavery, he becomes a gladiator and, thanks to his training and military experience, quickly becomes one of the best. Finally, he returns to Rome, eager to avenge the tyrannical emperor who stole his life and family.

Ok, this movie reminds me a lot of Ben Hur with all this story of revenge and injustice set in the Roman world, but let's talk first of what's good ... directed by Ridley Scott, has a good rhythm, no dead moments, and The director did a pretty good job. The script has an emotive story, with a coherent development that gives us strong and well developed characters. Russell Crowe did a good job and shines in the lead role in one of the films that shaped his career. Joaquin Phoenix also had one of the most remarkable films of his career here, giving his villain a ""rich narcissistic spoiled rich boy"" touch. Richard Harris made a good appearance in what would become one of his last film works. But the real good-bye to seventh art is Oliver Reed, giving life to Proximo, the head of the gladiator school. The prestigious actor passed away during the filming period. In the supporting cast, Djimon Hounsou and Connie Nielsen do a good job.

However, the movie is not flawless. The film takes advantage of the names of two Roman emperors who actually existed and succeeded one after another. This turned out to be a problem ... in fact the lives of these two emperors have nothing to do with what this movie shows, and the use of names and contexts raises serious questions about likelihood and historical rigor. There are also some problems of lack of logic and credibility. Regarding the work of the actors, I negatively highlight the bad dialogues of this film, with absolutely clich√© passages and excessive theatricality.

At the technical level, the film uses and abuses CGI, the state of the art at the time, to provide us with breathtaking scenarios that bring to our time the exaggerated glory and monumentality of Ancient Rome. It would be hard to do better than this. The deeply epic soundtrack accentuates this monumentality and has become one of the best-selling and most famous soundtracks in contemporary cinema, in all fairness. The special and sound effects highlighted the brutality of the fighting quite well, while the sets and costumes correspond well to what we might expect in an epic movie this season.

Unsurprisingly, and despite all the flaws, the film garnered five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Costume, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects) at the 2001 ceremony.",8
14 May 2021,All Romans bad- all slaves good,"This movie is in so many ways wannabe movie. Cinematography is good, but the story is missing something. Russell Crowe is not the best choice for the role of gladiator. Most of the movie he mumbles in his chin so you cannot understsnd the half of what he's saying. Maybe if he spoke Latin, we would understand him better. It's too distracting.

Also, movie is kinda 'good vs bad' which makes it flat and boring. One of the main characters, Lucilla is a tragic but too pretentious character so you cannot sympathise with her neither.

The main character is general turned gladiator, but the actor is too chubby and fat to play such a character. Soldiers and especially gladators in the anciant Roman Empire were the 3% body fat type of people, with limited access to food and all day hard trainings. This guy came out of war chubby and even when he became gladiator he still remained chubby after all that torture and hard training. It's confusing. Actor for that role cannot be 'all you can eat 24/7 buffer' type of person. Another proof that this is miss cast.

Only good thing in the movie is scenography, Roman amphiteater in particular. And music.",2
26 May 2005,What a pathetic film!,"I am far from an aficionado of film, but I had the unfortunate experience of seeing Russel Crowe in Gladiator tonight for the first time. I was bored senseless! Acting could have been better achieved by garden plants. The story? well.. the question is... is there a story? Special effects? They were certainly special!!! ... I have seen better on 40 year old episodes of ""Thunderbirds""! A dire film that showed it's class by being Network Premiered on Channel 5 in the UK! The only person I would recommend this so called ""film"" to is Medusa... perhaps she could turn it to stone! While special effects usually add to a film... on this occasion they detracted from the plot... the crowd scenes... have seen better in Ben Hur! Petals falling ... seen better in Evita. A very disappointing film.

14 June 2014,Decent,"This isn't really my kind of film. At all. I mostly saw it for Russell Crowe, and while I think he was really good, I thought that Joaquin Phoenix stole the film. It's great to see the actor behind The Master and Her deliver such a great performance early on in his career, before he was as acclaimed as he is now. He makes the character never wholly evil, and you can understand where his pain comes from. It's a great performance, although at times his writing is sketchy (as is the whole film's). Ridley Scott does a nice job with he directing, and his work here is what stands out more than the writing. Overall, decent, if with some reservations.

24 June 2013,"Russell Crowe At His Finest,","Gladiator is a fantastic movie with a storyline that stays exciting and fresh from start to finish and a cast that stay into their characters all the way through.The movie is a total flashback to the movie's of the fifties and sixties,like Ben Hur,and for the entire movie I was not convinced it was only made thirteen years ago,and I also wasn't convinced it was directed by Ridley Scott,a director who made movies such as Alien and Blade Runner,and I was shocked he could make a movie like this.It is without a doubt Russel Crowe's finest performance as he plays Maximus with great heart.Fans of history movies about gladiators,the Roman empire,etc,will definitely love Gladiator.

After having a falling out with his new emperor,Maximus (Russel Crowe) is forced to become a gladiator and ends up becoming impossible to defeat,fighting with the anger of his family's death.

31 August 2018,One-Line Review: Gladiator (7 Stars),"I watched the extended version of Ridley Scott's Gladiator, and despite my low interest on films related to Medieval era, I was simply mesmerized by its sheer magnitude, its energy, and the protagonist's (Russel Crowe) audacity to fight back in the face of failure, all of which could only be topped by the almost perfect casting of Joaquin Phoenix, his eyes, and his incredible performance as the brutal and henpecked emperor of the falling Roman empire.

30 December 2011,High Level of Excitement,"In ancient Rome, a gladiator seeks revenge against the emperor's son after the latter kills his family. Despite the extensive running time, the film does not drag at all. The credit for this goes to Scott, who directs with a sure hand and sustains a high level of excitement. However, scenes of bloody violence are gratuitous. The script may not be historically accurate but it is surely entertaining. Crowe is fine in the title role, turning in a quietly effective performance. Equally good is Phoenix as the evil emperor, a despicable weasel. Nielsen has little to do other than look worried but she looks quite beautiful doing it.

20 April 2020,Theatrical and extended cut review/comparison,"Is Gladiator a straight action movie? Not exactly. It's definitely action-packed, but to call it ""just"" and action movie would be doing the film a disservice in my opinion. This is not a mindless film, although it it a fairly easy watch. However, I do think it has a good deal of substance- it's a movie that stuck with me, and that's definitely not something that happens with most action movies I watch.

Action films are good ""relaxation"" movies. It's the genre you watch when you really can't be bothered thinking too much, and just want to switch your mind off a bit and watch stuff blow up and people get hurt. Action movies have a certain cathartic quality, and are often hugely entertaining because they show us things on screen that we hardly ever get to see in our day to day lives. As an action movie, Gladiator succeeds. There's a large number of exciting, fantastically shot and edited arena sequences that really make you feel as though you're there. The fight sequences are visceral and convincing. There's also a large scale battle at the start of the film, which in my opinion is the film's one low point. It's not quite as exciting as it should be, and it's bizarrely shot in jumpy slow motion and with hand-held cameras, a style that is not maintained throughout the film. It kinda feels like Saving Private Ryan's famous opening sequence (a little bit), which is odd. The rest of the movie's fantastic though.

It's not a deep film intellectually- the plot's quite straight-forward, the character's motivations are hardly ever ambiguous, and dialogue scenes never go on for a great deal of time. That being said, the film excels in my eyes because of its deep and engaging emotional core. I really cared for Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, and the moment he is betrayed by Commodus- a complete scumbag masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix- I was absolutely 100% rooting for him to get his revenge and bring his rival to justice.

Yeah, it's basically a revenge tale, but I think it really succeeds because Russel Crowe does such a fantastic job at making his character incredibly likeable, and Phoenix does such a good job at playing an utterly despicable villain. And sometimes, that's all you need in order to be utterly invested in a film, even a fairly long one (2.5 hours) like Gladiator. Of course, the movie has more going for it- a good screenplay, some memorable side characters, a fantastic score (Hans Zimmer at his best), some stunning cinematography, and great pacing too- there's hardly a dull moment in the entire movie. Plus the ending is amazing; absolutely perfect for the movie.

So, if it's not clear already, I'd say go ahead and watch this movie. Don't be put off by any expectations you might have towards it- it's honestly probably better than you think it's going to be. Make sure you watch the theatrical cut though, rather than the extended edition. The former goes for 155 minutes, while the latter goes for 171 minutes. Trust me, you really feel those extra 16 minutes in the extended cut.

Some DVDs and blu-rays try to pass the extended cut off as the ""Director's Cut,"" presumably because director Ridley Scott has somewhat of a reputation for having movies where the director's cut is generally seen as better than the theatrical cut- see Kingdom of Heaven (which I haven't seen yet), and Blade Runner. I knew something wasn't quite right when I watched Ridley Scott's one minute ""introduction"" to the so-called director's cut of the film. From memory, the very first thing he said was something along the lines of ""this is not my director's cut,"" stated that it was rather an ""extended cut,"" and then I think he even mentioned, or maybe implied, that he himself preferred the theatrical cut. Then someone must have glared at him off-camera, because I think he then begrudgingly said something about how the extended cut still made some interesting changes, before reiterating once again that this was NOT his ""director's cut,"" and not his preferred version.

Well, that's just great, I remembered thinking to myself. I watched the extended cut anyway, even if Ridley Scott's words had dampened my expectations considerably. It was interesting, to an extent, to compare it to the original (and significantly better) theatrical cut. Basically, I'd estimate that about 14 of the 16 new minutes purely focus on Phoenix's character, which oddly almost creates the impression that the movie is just as much about him as it is about Maximus. We see (or at least it feels as though we see) just as much Commodus as we do Maximus, and this takes the spotlight off the hero, whose journey we're supposed to be focused on, and shifts a bunch of the focus to Commodus, who we already hate enough just going by his scenes in the theatrical cut. His new scenes in the extended cut don't really give much new insight into his character- they just show him being a horrible person

We already knew he was a horrible person though. A massively horrible one.

So if you can help it, track down the theatrical cut for Gladiator rather than the extended cut. Best option might be to get the Blu-ray actually; it comes with both versions on the same disc (plus the picture quality is exceptional). That way, you can watch the theatrical cut first, and then if you really feel like it, you can check out the extended cut, but you'll likely be a little let down by it. Just a heads-up there. Because I care.

Really, the two cuts of Gladiator just go to show how much of a difference trimming a few scenes can make to a movie, and how just 16 extra minutes can kind of change the balance of an already extremely well-crafted story. The extended cut sort of kills the pacing a couple of times throughout the film, and awkwardly gives Commodus more scenes than he needs, but it's honestly still a very good movie. It's just that the theatrical cut is substantially better.

Absolutely give this movie a watch- it gets my highest recommendation (if that means anything to anyone).",10

3 July 2008,The illusion of Roman civilization,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
14 June 2000,proper epics are back!,"What can be said about this? It was pushed as a bloke movie, but it isn't. Its been suggested it is a mindless action flick, using computer effects to take attention away from a flimsy plot - not so. The script is fine and a hundred times better than the last epic I was unfortunate enough to see in the cinema - Titanic. Gladiator has a lot of heart and yes, the story may be a little hackneyed, there may be reminders of everything from Ben Hur to Caligula, but the acting is superb, the effects (which don't detract from the story) are great and the whole piece is very enjoyable. Proof that the epic isn't dead and that Hollywood can still make decent thoughtful films when it wants to. Excellent.

7 August 2023,"Outstanding, and Breathtaking","Gladiator (2000) The art direction in Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is a poor choice, creating a muddy, fuzzy, and indistinct film. The colors are mud tones, and the film appears to have been filmed on grim, overcast days. The darkness and lack of detail in long shots obscure shabby special effects, and the characters are bitter, vengeful, and depressed. The storyline is ""Rocky"" on downers, with Maximus, a general from Spain, being a favorite of dying emperor Marcus Aurelius. After defeating barbarians, Marcus names Maximus protector of Rome. The film's lack of cheer and shabby special effects make it difficult to enjoy the film. Maximus escapes murder and finds himself in North Africa as a slave to Proximo, a gladiator manager. Commodus lifts his father's ban on gladiators in Rome, and Maximus slashes his way to the top. The movie ends with the Big Fight. While ""Gladiator"" could have been rousing entertainment, it lacks joy and depression, using characters as bitter and morose to distract from their dullness. Commodus, a spoiled Roman emperor, is famous for his petulant nature and desires to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla. The moral backbone of the story is easily mastered, as Commodus aims to be a dictator but faces opposition from the senate led by Gracchus. Instead of providing sewers for the city's Greek district, Commodus decides to play games. Proximo, a seasoned gladiator from Africa, arrives and threatens the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson is that it is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight and then turn over power to politicians. The Colosseum productions resemble professional wrestling, with events staged to recreate famous battles. Commodus, a confused Commodus, questions whether the barbarians should lose the battle of Carthage. Caesar, the only undefeated Roman champion, introduces Titus to the crowd. The battle sequences are muddled, with muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, but those in cheaper seats are impossible to see due to murky special effects. Maximus wins his first big fight, and Commodus must decide whether he will live or die. The fans chant ""Live! Live!"" and Commodus signals with a ""thumbs up,"" indicating he was not paying attention to Caesar School's practice of closing the thumb in the fist to signal life. Fortunately, no one else in the Colosseum knows this. Caesar plays Maximus with a bearded, taciturn, brooding demeanor. His closest friend is Djimon Hounsou, who plays the passionate slave in ""Amistad."" Hounsou's ferocious appearance is effective due to protocol requiring minimal speech. Nielsen delivers the film's most depth as the sister, while Phoenix's performance as Commodus is passable. Old pros Harris, Jacobi, and Reed are reliable, with Scott providing some editing and digital work. ""Gladiator"" is often compared to ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur,"" but it's more like ""Spartacus Lite"" or dark. Julie Taymor's ""Titus"" is a better film set in ancient Rome, with a better visual accomplishment and better story.",10
1 June 2000,Ridley Scott seems to have done it again.,"What a great show this was. Gladiator was intense, and extremely well made. The casting was perfect, particularly on the parts of Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Both were startlingly convincing in their roles, and the fighting scenes were absolutely jaw-dropping. There's nothing like brutal violence to make your day complete, right?

The only complaint that I have about Gladiator was that I think it was a little too long, but then again, the best movies are generally a bit longer than average. Even more than that, though, were the special effects. In my opinion, if something looks even the tiniest bit fake, then it becomes immediately obvious that the audience is being manipulated, and that takes so much away from the movie. This happened most clearly with the lions toward the end of Gladiator.

As a whole, Gladiator was a spectacular film. It should not be missed by anyone (unless you have problems with seeing decapitations) and it will surely be added to Ridley Scott's respectable list of classics. The camera work, the striking use of color, the amazing acting, and the panoramic settings give this film truly epic proportions. Way to go, Ridley.",9
21 May 2005,What We Do In Life Echoes In Eternity; don't you just love that?,"Well, where to begin? I must say that I've always been an ancient history buff and I was into war-gaming when I was a teenager and into my early twenties. So, I had to do some reading about ancient warfare tactics and what have you. Now, the opening battle scene was a delight. It really gave me perspective on why the Roman army was so superior to most other armies of the time. Historically, the Romans relied on heavy artillery as a first hit and continued until the armies clashed. By then, their foes where already exhausted scared to death. This opening scene really made me see it happen.

That said, now let's talk about the movie. It was so entertaining. I was genuinely pleased throughout the whole movie. It was visually dazzling, well acted and all in all just plain lovely.

So why didn't I give it a ten? The story was just not 100% convincing however entertaining the movie was. But although I found the young Caesar's story slightly unbelievable, it did in a way reflect the lunacy that the rulers of the era where famous for.

A word about the actors: they all played their parts exceedingly well and all the parts suited them perfectly. Russel Crowe was truly great, Richard Harris was indeed Caesar and Connie Nielsen was edible (wink, wink... what can I do, I absolutely love her?!) I can't really go on about everyone in that movie, but I can say that every single one was just great.",9
13 January 2014,Epic historical drama,"What I love the most about this film is how it transports me directly to the Era of Ancient Rome in all of its glory. The sheer scope of this film is awe-inspiring, from the brutal battle scenes against the barbarians, to the slave markets of the Middle-East to the Colosseum of Rome. It all looks, sounds and feels real, and the era has never been more accurately represented.

This is also one of Russell Crowe's crowning achievements. He fully disappears into the role of General Maximus, aptly portraying both the brilliant military leader, the anguished family man after revenge as well as the beacon of hope for the people of Rome. The story of Gladiator is his story, and a bad casting choice would have ruined the whole film. In this case it elevates it to a masterpiece territory.

The rest of the actors do a fine job as well, though I've never quite gotten the appeal of Joaquin Phoenix, playing here the corrupted emperor Commodus. He's fine villain objectively, but I think he's perhaps a shade too slimy with very little charisma. I get that's the purpose, but I would have preferred a villain with a hint more backbone. Still, only a nitpick.

Aside from that, it's an all-around great film with intense and well-choreographed fight scenes, interesting characters, high production values and great use of both music and colour. It's no wonder they're still talking about the soundtrack of this film.

Do you like action, historical dramas or pretty much anything with convincing characters and great storytelling? Then this film is for you.",10

28 November 2008,Are you not entertained?,"Some people claim that Braveheart is the best epic movie ever made: they are really wrong, and is one of the worst films ever made. Gladiator one the other hand is a very good movie, showing that Ridley Scott is a master film-making, showing that he can do any genre and helped make Russell Crowe into a true A-lister.

Gladiator tells the story of Maximus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a Roman General who fought in the war against Germanian tribes. After a massive victory for the Roman, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his children Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) arrive at the frontline. Marcus Aurelius doubts Commodus abilities to become Emperor and asks Maximus to protect Rome by bringing back the Republic and make the Senate powerful again. However before Maximus could do anything Commodus murders his father and arrests Maximus, planning to kill him. When Maximus he returns to his farm and finds his wife and son were murder and he gets captured by Commodus forces. He is sold into slavery and then a gladiator in a backwater in North Africa. In Rome Commodus decides to reintroduce gladiatorial contests in honour of his father who had banned them. Because of Maximus and his comrades success in North Africa they get a chance to fight in Rome. Maximus becomes so success that the people of Rome love him and becomes a challenge to the Emperor.

What Gladiator does well is fight and battle scene. Scott brings in realistic violence which wasn't allowed during the golden age of sword and scandal epics. It's a gore fest, but its a good gore fest. The fights were brilliant. The battle scene at the beginning of film is one of the best ever in cinema, must better then anything in Braveheart. The battle was realistic, showing how the Roman army would have fought against a Barbarian army. Compare it to anything in Braveheart which was a farce in all respects. The acting in the film is top-notch. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were on the top of their game and this film is an example of why they became a-listers. Oliver Reed offered the audience his swansong and even Omid Djalili offered a little light relief. As well Ridley Scott tries to show Commodus as a more human character, that he did have some redeemable features like his love for his nepthew. The characters are not completely good or completely evil. It doesn't try to moralise the issues. Compare to the God-awful Braveheart where they is no attempt to show the characters as human or realistic, and that all English characters were pure evil and all Scots were goodness and like. The film also had a solid script behind it, which is very quotable and has a good, classical story behind it. It has a old fashion feel to it, and Ridley Scott said that he was influenced by films like Ben-hur and Spartacus. This is one of my brother's favourite films.

However, one of the big problems with the film is that one of the best scenes was right at the beginning of the film, similar to Saving Private Ryan, which means that nothing each can in the film can compare to it. As well, whilst most of the film is realist, they are some aspects which are not so realist, like when Tigris of Gaul enters into the Colosseum, but those thinks are minor and doesn't affect the enjoyment.

I criticise Braveheart for its historical inaccuracies, but don't do the same with Gladiator. That's because Braveheart was pretending to be a historical film and telling the facts (it doesn't), Gladiator also set itself out to be a fictional story and nothing a rewrite of history.

Whether Gladiator deserved to win all the Oscars it got is debatable, but it is a very entertaining film.",9
24 February 2001,I'm terribly vexed.,"Best Picture?? Best.... Picture?? One more time: BEST PICTURE???

If this thing wins best picture, I'm going to strip to the tunic and loincloth and protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and trust me, nobody wants that.

I mean, have the nominators actually seen the movie? Since when does cheesey, intelligence insulting popcorn fodder like this disappointing movie win anything better than an award given out at the separate ceremony for technical achievement? The acadmeny has let me down before, no doubt about it. But at least the academy has always rewarded ""good"" movies, even when you felt a better movie was robbed. Forrest Gump shouldn't have beaten Pulp Fiction, but at least Forrest Gump was good. Same with Shakespeare in Love beating Saving Private Ryan, or Ordinary People beating Raging Bull. But if Gladiator wins, I think it will be the first time ever that a ""bad"" movie wins the top honor. I can't even recall a ""bad"" movie even getting nominated before.

Let's not kid ourselves. Gladiator is a bad movie. I know the special effects were great, and you paid 8 bucks to see it... I know Gladiator does the whole action/violence/sword-swinging-epic thing better than a lot of its competition. And I know you've been saying it was a good movie all this time, so to make the admission that it was bad now would be to quietly admit that you've been watching a lot of bad movies and wasting a lot of money and time. But for God's sake DO IT. Admit it. You'll feel better.

Normally I'd let this go. People watch it, they like it, what's the harm? A little mindless afternoon entertainment for a small fee. But when the industry leaders prepare to give this thing the top honors for the year, then we've got to take a stand. You need to find your nearest Academy voter, look him right in the inebriated bloodshot eye, and tell him that if he votes for this stupid movie, he deserves to be tied up and beaten with bamboo.

I won't bother defending why I think it's stupid. All the reasons should be utterly apparent to anyone who's seen it.",
23 April 2002,praiseworthy,"Crowe is a tower of strength in this big, grand, compelling story of a loyal, steadfast Roman general and his long, arduous journey to redemption after he's sold into slavery for refusing to pledge allegiance to the venal young prince Commodus (Phoenix). Despite tragic detours, he eventually finds his way to the Colosseum where he becomes a fierce and influential gladiator, while still maintaining his vow to claim retribution against the ruthless emperor. The vision of Roman times is imaginatively brought to life by director Scott as the film boasts remarkable set design, well-drawn characters, powerful performances (anchored by Crowe's commanding presence), and rousing battle scenes. The story may not hold up to the forcefulness of the film itself, but it's an impressive feature nonetheless. ***¬Ω

31 May 2007,"Not Great, But Good, IN SPITE Of Crowe's Involvement!","Let me begin by saying that I believe this movie deserved the awards it won, but not because of Russell Crowe. Mainly, this was a good movie because of Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix, who had to work AROUND Crowe, and support his performance, in order for his ""work"" to even be watchable, much less steal an Oscar for the best leading male role. He SO didn't deserve that.

I also have to admit that I did NOT agree that Gladiator was the best movie of 2000. I thought that award should have gone to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now THAT was a film! Other than my misgivings surrounding Crowe's inept performance and the fact that he did not deserve the awards he won, Gladiator is still enjoyable; despite Crowe's involvement, however, NOT because of it.

Joaquin Phoenix is GREAT in this film and makes it well worth watching.

It rates a 6.6/10 from...

5 August 2010,Gladiatorial coup de grace - moving and exciting,"Despite it's historical inaccuracies Gladiator without a doubt deserves it's 5 Oscars. The story follows Maximus, a Roman general who's family is murdered after he is betrayed and left for dead. While the story echoes The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Gladiator's revenge theme is far more ambitious and poignant.

Meticulous portraying the social and political issues of the time, proved director Ridley Scott, utilising David Franzoni story and screenplay, single handily brings back the sword and sandal epic that prompted a flurry of copycat films.

The opening scene is astounding, the fights are incredibly choreographed, however, Gladiator is far from perfect, let down by a variety of CGI shots, the lack of grandeur that other epics have and several hollow palace scenes. That said, Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer score is exciting, emotionally moving as much as the actor's performances.

Thankfully, Mel Gibson turned down the part of Maximus that Russell Crowe portrays with such conviction and energy. Even though it was Oliver Reed's last great performance and one of Richard Harris finest, as Marcus Aurelius, the new comers hold their own and are just as effective. Juaquin Phoenix. Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi and supporting actors are perfectly cast. Aside from the magnificent sets and locations to the cast credit it's the ability to render the viewers concern for these characters is what separates Gladiator from being an run of the mill flick.

It's no masterpiece but far from a gladiatorial coup de grace. Scott's compelling Gladiator is impressive, moving and exciting.",
22 December 2000,larger-than-life movie that will take its place among the pantheon of great action epics,"Although everything under the sun has already been said about this movie, I wish to reiterate what many other reviewers have already commented on. First and foremost, the movie is astoundingly grand and thoroughly enjoyable. More importantly, despite some of the plot's predicatibility, the overall pace of the movie is well-maintained throughout the movie. The acting, Joaquin Phoenix in particular, is terrific for such a blockbuster action-styled movie. For the epic-action genre, this movie hits the mark and more.

29 October 2003,Ridley Scott Goodness,"Back when Crowe was not a household word (unless you had seen ROMPER STOMPER) this is the usual brilliance by director Scott. A cool story, cool visuals and effects, cool acting... just plain cool. If you haven't seen it... why on earth not? If you have, see it again!

2 April 2001,Best Picture? Huh?!,"Probably the worst movie to ever win the best picture Oscar (certainly the worst I've seen.)

Sure, the action is fun, the acting and directing are solid and the special effects are nice, but 'best picture'? The script for Gladiator leaves so much to be desired that everything the movie has going for it was not enough to keep me interested with the characters and the story.

A 'fun' popcorn movie, but no way does it deserve the best picture Oscar (even with the dearth of good movies in 2000.)just another overhyped, big budget Hollywood movie.

9 June 2007,"""Infamy! Infamy!...they've all got it in for me!""","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6
5 December 2000,Sandals in the wind,"Ridley Scott attempted to do to sword-and-sandal pictures with this movie what James Cameron did for highfalutin disaster pics with Titanic. In other words, a bombastic, explicit, harrowing, no-holds-barred epic. And succeed the action auteur has.

Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a loyal general in the Roman army. The Romans have conquered most of the civilized world, and there is only one outpost remaining. The stolid Maximus and his troops overtake the enemy, earning the grace of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The dying Emperor calls his general to his bedside and tells him that when he's shuffled off this mortal coil, he wants Maximus to be the ""defender of Rome"" and the leadership of the empire to go not to his son but back to the long-abandoned Roman Senate. It's quite a radical plan for the Emperor to have, and Maximus, against his own wishes, consents.

When the aged Aurelius dies, however, the plan changes. The Emperor's snotty, belligerent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) assumes command (which is easy, since he's the son and no one else knew of the Emperor's plans) and orders the execution of Maximus. The stunned general is led off, but naturally defeats his captors. He becomes a slave and is eventually sold to Proximus (Oliver Reed, in his final movie) and is forced to fight as a gladiator in arenas for the amusement of the aristocrats (severe shades of Spartacus!). And, of course, he must somehow win his freedom, get the girl (who happens to be Commodus' sister), and avenge the murders of his wife and son, which happened when he was to be executed.

Crowe grips his sword with an unyielding passion, gladly taking up the mantle passed to him by such golden-boy icons as Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. He's been touted as the Next Big Thing for a while now, but he seems like he'll be sticking around. Check him out in L.A. Confidential - or if you're in the mood for mediocre fluff, try Virtuosity with Denzel Washington. But Gladiator is the absolute pinnacle of Crowe's relatively brief career. The Aussie magnificently holds his own as an action star and still finds time to emote properly. (Ah, I'm such a sucker for a good emote!) Those of you who want to see him shirtless, you're in luck - however, in some of the scenes he's buried in some seriously huge and obtrusive armor.

Crowe's Maximus is completely loyal to the empire, and it blows his mind that he could go from being so highly respected in the land to being a slave. But this is not a morality tale of how a well-off man must suffer so that he may know the less-fortunate; in fact, there's not much moralizing here (aside from the usual vengeance-shall-be-mine theme). Once he's escaped his executioners, Maximus adopts an attitude of grim determination. He's relentless in his goal - he MUST save Rome. This kind of character development we don't get to see much in action movies, and while the movie is exceptionally well written for such a genre film, it's really Crowe's show. A lesser actor might have grunted and grimaced his way through much of the dialogue, but Crowe was more than up to the task. This was a blockbuster at the box office, and with great reason. This might even be one for the ages. My policy is to never overpraise a film as a ""classic"" (or, worse yet, ""instant classic,"" as if you only needed to add water), so I'll restrain myself here. The best way to find out if a movie is a classic is to wait 20 years. This way you get a more subjective historical perspective on the film - who's to say that in 20 years we'll think of this film as a nostalgia piece of the early 2000's?",9

6 June 2000,SWIIIIIIIINGGGGG!,"I am sure glad I decided to go see the new epic film ""Gladiator."" This movie is sure to be a hit with all audiences! Set in the glory days of Rome, the film is about a former commander who is enslaved and must be a gladiator to seek revenge and survive. Could somebody say ""summer blockbuster""? It is not inside confidential information anymore, Russell Crowe is not just a fine actor but now he is a big star. His performance as the gladiator was subtle, but yet, powerful. Co-star Joaquin Phoenix also delivered a swashbuckling performance. However, he still has many rivers to cross before he gets to Crowe's acting status. Follow my advice- Do not save it for later, go see ""Gladiator."" **** Good

23 January 2023,"A great epic, with beautiful moments and a good dose of impactful scenes, which deserves recognition within what it sets out to do","When it was released in the early 2000s, ""Gladiator"" quickly became a public and critical success, becoming a legitimate representative of the great epics and crowning its career on Oscar night, when it won the award for best film. However, in the following years the feature quickly entered the list of Academy Award-winning films that go from beloved to hated, being treated pejoratively among many moviegoers. Fortunately, the historical distance allows us to verify that Ridley Scott's film is not the masterpiece that it was said to be when it was released, much less the crap that others claimed to be in the following years. It is a worthy epic, with beautiful moments and a good dose of impactful scenes, which deserves recognition within what it sets out to do.

Written in six hands by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson, the script for ""Gladiator"" is a historical salad full of unnecessary hits and misses, which develops its characters in an irregular way, but manages to find a common thread in the dramatic arc of its plot. Protagonist, the Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who, after years being the trusted man of the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), ends up being condemned to death by Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the son of the emperor who murders his father to inherit the command of the empire. After surviving and fleeing, Maximus is captured, sold into slavery, and returned to Rome to fight as a gladiator.

If it succeeds in showing how Roman politics was driven by personal interests, betrayals and the desire for power, which is no different from the current political scenario in many parts of the planet, ""Gladiator"" slips by making unnecessary changes to the story that do not add to the narrative. Nor do they reinforce the emotional impact that the feature naturally carries, such as by hiding the fact that Marcus Aurelius had prepared his son to be his successor in his last years of life and, what is worse, turning Commodus into his father's murderer, when in true, he actually exiled and had someone in his family executed, but it was his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), something that is ignored by the script, which still brings the sister speaking about the body of the egocentric emperor killed in the Coliseum (which also does not occurred, as he was strangled while taking a shower).

It is true that Commodus loved fights and even entered the arena as a gladiator (he considered himself the new Hercules), just as the emperor knew about the political power of bread and circuses as a form of population control - and his father never forbade them. Games, contrary to what is said in the movie. Likewise, the script succeeds in portraying Lucilla politically articulating with the Senate to assassinate her brother, which led to her death in the real story. It is noted, therefore, that the changes in the script did not need to exist, since the true story is impactful and would work very well, being perfectly possible to insert the fictional trajectory of Maximus in this context.

Equally responsible for the far from faithful version of the story he portrays, as he is a director who almost always had the right to the ""final cut"", Ridley Scott at least compensates for this slip with a vigorous direction in the most important moments of the feature. Focusing much more on Maximus' trajectory than on the political articulation around him, Scott and his editor Pietro Scalia hit important moments like the battles in the Coliseum and print an interesting rhythm that never lets the narrative become tiring. In addition, the director manages to extract good performances from practically all of his cast, even in the face of characters developed in such an irregular way.

Obviously, the most complete of them is the protagonist Maximus, played by the talented Russell Crowe, who imposes himself by composing a serious man and who conveys the virility required of both a general and a gladiator, but who finds space to demonstrate values dear to the character as loyalty to the emperor he served and love for the family he left behind, as well as the desire for revenge that exudes in moments like when he announces his true name to Commodus in the middle of the Colosseum. The rare moment when Maximus's rigid expressions break when he finds the family murdered is also one that proves Crowe's ability, who carries ""Gladiator"" with enormous ease.

Djimon Hounsou's Mane, on the other hand, does not receive the same attention from the script, appearing arbitrarily and quickly being transformed into Maximus's great friend, being discarded with the same ease with which he appears in the protagonist's trajectory. Even so, he manages to empathize with him, demonstrating strength and loyalty until the final moment, although, unlike the way he is shown in the feature, the gladiators did not make friends precisely because they knew that they could face each other in a battle in which only one would survive.

Commodus, in turn, makes the complete transition from the initially tired and even fragile Emperor sucked in by the surrounding politics to the cruel sociopath devoid of political savvy who does not hesitate to use his nephew as a tool to threaten his sister, with whom he was in love. . Underhanded and exaggerated in the lamentations that weaken the Emperor, Joaquin Phoenix recovers in the final act, conveying the insanity of a man who was so self-centered that he even changed the name of Roma to Commodiana - something that ""Gladiator"" also hides.

Extremely political, Connie Nielsen's Lucilla knows that her brother's madness would never allow her to gain the respect of the Senate and sees in his death the chance to assume command of the empire, while Oliver Reed's Next is a confused character, what time seems motivated only by the profit that his activity brings him and, at other times, he assumes a moral code incoherent with his posture until then. Finally, Richard Harris completes the main cast living a complex Marcus Aurelius, who conveys wisdom in his few minutes on the scene.

On the technical side, the film excels in its visual reconstitution of the architecture and clothing worn by people of the time, and also for its sophisticated battle scenes, such as the initial clash between Romans and barbarians, and the staging of a battle from the War of Cartago. Also excellent is Ridley Scott's critique of the use of violence as a political instrument of manipulation, as well as the policy of bread and circuses, by which Commodus made gladiatorial battles permitted once again, after years of prohibition in his government. Father, so that he may more easily win the love of the common people. ""He will give them death, and they will love him for it,"" says Senator Gracchus. The decay of Rome is the main reason why Marcus Aurelius wanted the senate back in power, and it is this flame of change that Commodus seeks to extinguish with his firm fist.

Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely flawless. The filmmaker's technical ability is demonstrated in several parts of the film, namely in the coliseum battle sequences where we are presented with magnificent fighting spectacles, brilliantly choreographed and captured. The soundtrack by the iconic Hans Zimmer also deserves a small mention of appreciation, as it conveys depth to several important scenes in the film. With beautifully conducted battle scenes and impressive visual effects, Ridley Scott captivates the viewer with his vision of Rome. When we watch the people receiving bread and circuses and when we are confronted with the size of the Coliseum - and the barbarity that they received there - it is difficult not to remember the history classes, when we only heard about that period. Logically, Gladiator should not be seen as a faithful portrait of the time, but the care taken in the production makes us believe, during the unfolding of the film, that we are witnessing History.

Wide shots that when they appear allow us to contemplate the splendid Rome recreated with impressive visual effects, taking us back to the glory years of the empire. Among the numerous grandiose constructions of the imposing capital, it is clear that the Coliseum is the big star (even today, by the way) and the work of recreating the gigantic arena is worthy of applause. Aware of this, the first time we enter it, Ridley Scott places us in a low plane that accompanies the gladiators and enhances the place even more, reinforcing its impact on the characters and the spectator. By the way, the first battle in the Coliseum is very interesting, especially due to the director's choices, which this time succeeds in abusing general shots that emphasize the military strategy adopted by Maximus and followed by his companions. In addition, once again the sound design collaborates to throw us inside the arena and make everything even more exciting.

Still bringing emotional moments such as the mentioned return of Maximus to find his family cruelly murdered, the beautiful kiss scene between him and Lucilla and the touching final sequence in which he leaves this world and finds his family again in any other plane, there is no denying the strength of this grandiose epic, even with easily avoidable historical errors. For two and a half hours we are transported to Ancient Rome by Ridley Scott, through this competent and emotional film that deserves all the cinematographic awards won. ""Gladiator"" is a great production that deserves all the glory achieved until today.",9
27 July 2020,Review No. 2644,"Well, it's one of my favorite war crime movies. Hate the scene where they kill Daniel Striped Tiger.

25 August 2005,A very good movie - in spite of its grand spectacle style,"Gladiator is 2 1/2 hours long and I watched it in two parts. I agree completely with ""gregatory"" (another reviewer - see that review) in most respects.

Russel Crowe is clearly one of the greatest actors alive today. His role here is nothing short of that. Also the description of the almost impossibly gory battle scene in the beginning (as well as the gladiator scenes later), could be trivial blood and gore performances. But they are not. It is clear how brutal these things were, but the craft the the producers use to portray them makes them sensible and tolerable. What we see is the horror of war - even before anybody had a gun or cannon or bomb.

Frankly, I was put off by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He played a despicable and weak, palsied man so well it seemed his acting was equally bad. It annoyed me and I almost panned the movie for that. But I believe that was a personal bias. Apparently the role was just that - awful, the man was awful, that is.

The second part (for me) fit together with the plot and was quite credible. Still the movie lacked something to make it absolutely great. It was also somewhat predictable - not an ingenious plot.

So I rate it as very very good (8 points) but not great. As I mentioned though, Russel Crowe is great. I think, like Clint Eastwood, he is typecasting himself. His role and performance does remind me of Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.

He is definitely the Commander.",8
8 January 2001,The movie that echoes in eternity,"I like this film. I like the music, the screenplay, the acting it all goes together in a way that makes a good film.

2 July 2012,CGI Overkill,"First of all, the CGI is terrible and mostly gratuitous. I don't see why the director couldn't shoot some REAL natural landscapes for Crowe's psychedelic flashbacks. As for Rome, it was all obviously fake, computer generated crap. Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations. Watch ¬ÑLawrence of Arabia"" for example and you'll feel the difference. What a sad irony that a film made 40 years prior to ¬ÑGadiator"" gives class to contemporary cinema...

Secondly, the action was excessively violent. I won't even discuss the historical accuracy. The only bright spots are Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, both over-the-top in a pretty entertaining way. Russell's presence is overwhelming thanks to a spectacular physique and charisma... but not even his amazing acting skills can't save this movie. The music by Lisa Gerrard wasn't necessarily bad, but redundant when applied to (over)emotional scenes. That's the way to manipulate crowds: play the violins and let the blood/tears flood the screens. By the way, Gerrard's music was infinitely better and more properly used in ""The Insider"".",6
27 May 2000,"(""Blood & Guts in Ancient Rome"" - sorry ladies, this film is *not* called ""Russell Crowe gets his Kit Off"")","An epic worthy of the best traditions of this sort of cinema. Top notch acting, an opening battle scene that almost does for that time period what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 - it recreates the sheer horror inflicted by the Roman Army. Later, the actual gladiator scenes in Rome are also convincingly portrayed. The cerebral elements where we follow the moral strengths and weaknesses of the characters give it more substance than a mere action movie. Its main weakness is probably that which most big Hollywood epics have had - no more than a passing attempt to use the film as an art form - this, as the gladiator organizer says, is entertainment. (Note - from the little history I've been able to glean, the storyline - who kills who - seems to be largely fiction, although the portrayal of the characters of the main players seems reasonable enough and the other details are apparently quite well constructed. So we get quite a reasonable picture of the Empire in this context if we ignore the plot. Perhaps some historians reading this will want to add details about the lives and deaths of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus and Commodus just to keep the record straight.)",8
3 December 2021,History and balance,"Gladiator is a rare movie that grabs you and transports you back in time to the destruction of the tribes we came from. The atmosphere is drenched with entitlement and also injustice which helps to balance the chaos of colonisation. The cinematography is captivating and the sound track is evocative, but the lessons of the characters is inbeded in every setting right down to the loyalty of a dog. This film is for the victim and also the Victor.

6 May 2001,Overly rated but good action/drama...,"1st watched 5/7/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Ridley Scott): Overly rated but good action/drama from director Ridley Scott. The cinematography was great, and Joaquin Phoenix as the Caesar was excellent(which should have won him an Oscar), but of course Crowe won for an ok performance as best actor. The film was directed well by Scott, but our appeal to the characters was lacking as opposed to a similar Oscar winner in ""Braveheart"" in that it had a lot of violence but Gibson was wonderfully captivating where Crowe was again just ok. It seems like Oscar always tends to like a overly-produced epic know matter how good it is these days. I hope that it returns to simple storytelling for it's best picture winners (aka. Chariots of Fire, Driving Miss Daisy etc...) in the future.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul.

In my opinion it's unfairly rated. Don't misunderstand me, it's NOT overrated, but 8.5 imdb is way too much. I don't mind it having this big imdb, but movies it rips-off which also are also much better are rated lower (for example Braveheart 8.3, Ben-Hur 8.1).

15 June 2004,Do You Like Movies About Gladiators?,"Once upon a time, Hollywood made lots of movies like this, with ""Quo Vadis?"" ""Ben Hur"", and ""Sparticus"" springing most quickly to mind. Then the space age arrived, and sword & sandal epics became as pass√© as the western.

Fortunately, Ridley Scott and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. Frankly, the story of Maximus, a toppled Roman general who reclaims his political clout in the ring of gladiatorial combat, is a little thin when you think about it. But it's delivered with a lot of panache and visual flair.

Russell Crowe isn't too multi-dimensional, but he's more than adequate in the role of Maximus, tender at times but more a gloomy muscleman. He's interesting, even brilliant in flashes, like when he finds the dead bodies of his wife and son, but he doesn't engage you enough to fret overmuch over his fate. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance as the mad Roman emperor Commodus, ""vexed"" as he is by Maximus's reappearance but trying in his own sad way to be noble and loving. At times Phoenix seems to be channeling Malcolm McDowell, though not the time McDowell actually played an emperor in the nasty ""Caligula.""

Speaking of British film stars of the 1960s/1970s, there are three of them in this film, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and David Hemmings, all of whom are now dead just four years after the picture's release. This amounts to something of a swan song for all of them, a fitting one as it turns out. Reed especially has his moments. Connie Nielsen presents us with both regal sexiness and hurt-stained eyes as Commodus's sister Lucilla, Maximus's former lover who clearly carries a torch still.

We wait for Maximus and Lucilla to take up again where they left off, now that Maximus is single again, but the film reminds us time and again that Maximus's loyalty to his family extends beyond death, that he believes he will see them again in the afterlife. This spiritual dimension, unexpected from a film set in pagan times, lifts the film in my mind to the point where it really clicked with a lot of audiences. It also sets up Crowe's best bits of dialogue in the second half of the movie.

Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Colisseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.

But Maximus's followers are never adequately developed as people worth caring about. Also half-baked is some intrigue involving Lucilla and some Roman senators, including Derek Jacobi, who needs to be wearing a toga like Clint Eastwood does a cowboy hat. The crowd reactions to Maximus, especially when they suddenly recognize him en masse as the lost general who had never visited Rome and chant his name to spare him from Commodus's fury, cries out as obvious plot convenience. These aren't major flaws, but they do stick out on repeat viewings. 'Gladiator,' like many spectacles ancient and modern, never quite satisfies as well as it does the first time you see it.

All in all, I have a hard time accepting this as the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner, especially over ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which is a more amazing feast for the senses and a better story besides. But 'Gladiator' is a good film, something more than your average blockbuster, and worthy watching.",7
3 April 2001,Gimme a break!,"Gladiator is a corny shoot-em-up movie with a plot about as simplistic as Star Wars.....hence the Oscar for Best Picture. The special effects were good (not as good as those in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), but the story was just plain lacking; a man with some fighting skills has his family killed, is imprisoned, forced to fight, and eventually kills the source of it all in a thoughtlessly and simplisticly set-up battle in the end of the movie. I mean, what the hell was the emperor of Rome doing fighting a gladiator in a colosseum in the first place? Did the writers not know how to end the movie in a more clever manner? Stabbing Russel Crowe in the back with a knife didn't ""cut it"" for me, no pun intended. Gladiator was entertaining, and was certainly worth some form of an Oscar, but it was definitely not ""Best Picture"" material.

10 April 2011,Ridley Scott's masterpiece,"Gladiator is arguably the first real iconic movie of the 21st Century. When i first saw this movie i wasn't so sure about it but having revisited it i really do think that this is one of the best movies of all time. What i love about this film is that Ridley Scott made this film look so authentic and mostly thanks to the modern day magic of the blue screen. The scenes of the Colosseum and the gladiatorial fights are the work of a true genius. Of coarse it helps to have a great cast and Russell Crow is the perfect man to play Maximus. His performance is amazing and it leaves you totally believing in everything the Roman did or said. Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed ( who died during the filming of this ) are also fantastic and deserve a great deal of credit for their displays. Gladiator contains one of the most iconic movie scenes of all time - who can forget this "" My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."" Pure dramatic pleasure. If you haven't seen this since 2000 you must see it it again.

8 August 2010,"I liked it, but it could have been more.","Somewhere in history the purveyors of psychology and psychiatry infected and influenced how media operates and presents stories. The positive is that the stories have weightier impact on the movie going public. But there's an obvious downside;

The movies have no morals.

They are valueless.

So it is with ""Gladiator"" and the screenplay upon which this film is based. The characters are depicted as having motivations nested deep within their psyche, when in truth no such aspect was present in the real historic figures, notably Commodious. Crowe's Maximus is also similarly one-dimensional, such that the film can be nothing more than a revenge flick set in Imperial Rome.

On top of this Ridley Scott, an excellent visual director, struggles to find palpable story material. And for a lack of it, tosses in a surreal or spiritual element that seems wholly out of place. Particularly when depicted with processed shots to show his ultimate goal and desires. Do we really need to see time lapse photography and surreal dream sequences representing the ""afterlife""? It's confusing because this film isn't about religious issues. In theory, at least, it's about a man trying to contend with some spoiled tyrants psychological short comings.

Which should give the astute viewer pause. Recall your classic sword- and-sandal epics. Oh, say, ""Spartacus"". How psychologically damaged were any of the characters in ""Spartacus""? How about ""Ben Hur""? ""Cleopatra""? Anybody? How about any film before 1970?

Answer; zero.

But, we progress through the social ""revolutions"" of the 1960s, and suddenly there is no right and wrong. Everything is relative, and acts of evil must be caused by some form of child abuse or other emotional trauma.

Was there ever a bigger lie foisted on the public?

And this is why ""Gladiator"" fails to be a whole movie, but a palpable one to watch. It's theme and morals are lacking because they were never there to begin with. The honor of a general really has nothing to contend against, because the antagonist is so logically vilified that we know the outcome before the film is over with.

That, and ""Gladiator"" lacked money. The original ending would have had Maximus's army colliding with Rome's Praetorian guard. A visual feast worthy of the cinematic talents of Ridley Scott. But, instead, we get this mano-a-mano crescendo that feels like a low budget alternative, because hey, it is.

Gladiator had the promise of being a whole film. It really did. It's a magnificent piece to watch. Brilliantly staged and shot, but it so misses in the thematic department that one might as well watch a baseball game. I'm quite serious about that.

Heck, even ""The Ten Commandments"", the epitome of religious film making, and this comment comes from an atheist, had more heart and soul than ""Gladiator"". And that's really too bad, because I happen to like elements of ""Gladiator"", but again, it's a half baked film like so much other mental-health drivel that's been cranked out in the last thirty years.

This is why Roger Ebert astutely observed that this film feels like it's about more than it actually is. I would take that bit of profundity further, and apply to every so called modern adult film produced in the last three decades, and let the morons who've taken film making into a direction that sensationalizes emotion, but sucks the life out of hear, mind and soul. It is the reason classics will always remain classics, and why we've seen no classics since the 1960s. Just pretty tabloids disguising themselves as issue driven films, when in reality values are truncated, and the esteem of the emotional health of the individual is placed on the throne.

So it is with ""Gladiator"". Imperial Rome didn't suffer from abused children. It's worst aspects were created by criminals who didn't care about what happened to their fellow man, because they wanted things their way. So it is with history. And so should it have been with ""Gladiator"".

All in all, a watchable film for the fight sequences, but hardly the cinematic experience other reviews would lead you to believe.",
22 March 2023,"Maximus pleases the crowds, Ridley Scott pleases the cinema!","I have had a fondness with Roman history since watching the 1964 epic The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), directed by Anthony Mann which covers the same period in Roman history and many of the same characters.

I became a bit bored in the first act of the film comparing it to the aforementioned The Fall of the Roman Empire rather than admiring it on its own merits which grew on me as the film progressed into the second and third act.

The first act I would say covers the period of the death of the emporer Marcus Aurelius and his reluctance to hand over his power to his heir, son Commodus instead preferring to make Rome a republic again under the regency of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a General renowned for his skills in battle including recent battles in Germania.

Now where the film veered away from just being a remake of The Fall of the Roman Empire was in acts 2 and 3 as the story centred more on the Gladatorial battles in Rome and the story of how Maximus becomes a renowned Gladiator wanting to avenge the murder of his wife and child by the dictatorial rule of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).

Being a film epic in scale the story can wane every now and then however there are battles aplenty with plenty of gore. To be honest I thought I had seen the pinnacle of historical battle gore with Braveheart (1995) but this beats that!

The cast includes plenty of talent including Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris as well as the central characters played by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Sadly Reed as a slave trader in the film died during production. The film was made in a period when CGI started to be put to major use in cinema allowing his scenes not yet filmed to be continued with a body double. CGI also was a contributor to scenes of Rome including the Colosseum.

The film rightly received Academy Award recognition including Best Picture and has a healthy box office and viewer rating. However it appears that not all is historical fact. Now I have a question for some of the more pretentious critics of the historical accuracy of such films as this and Braveheart (1995). At what point do major motion pictures exist to excite cinema audiences than become a history documentary?",9
8 May 2000,"Yes, Joey, I like gladiator movies","If you see Peter Graves, tell him there is a gladiator movie for all of us to like!

The movie is a class act all the way, with the elements of an epic intact. Crowe and the cast are terrific, even though I had a problem with Joaquin Phoenix occasionally. Nice to see Oliver Reed go out with a great role.

I hope the movie does well and I am glad it got made. I cannot say it left me breathless or awestruck, but I enjoy it.

10 June 2000,Wow! and again I say WOW!,"Every so often, a film comes along that seems to have just about everything : a compelling story, incredible acting, fine sets and costumes and music. And -Gladiator- is such a film. Russell Crowe gives an extraordinarily textured performance as the central character Maximus, a warrior-poet who chooses private life over public ambition and then finds his world turned upside down. (IMHO, Mr. Crowe should have been the winner of this year's Best Actor Oscar for his work in -The Insider- ; the performance he gives here merely serves to reinforce that conviction.) Connie Nielsen is radiant as Lucilla, daughter to the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (finely played by Richard Harris). Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and the late Oliver Reed also deserve kudos for their performances. But it is Joaquin Phoenix whom I found the most intriguing. His Commodus is that film rarity : a ""round"" villain...if indeed that word even applies in this case. The character's motivations can be understood, and, even if the choices Commodus makes cannot be approved, at least one can sympathize with the twistedness foisted upon him that leads to such choices. Nine stars out of 10. (Be forewarned: The violence is a bit heavy-going at times...but the Romans didn't build and maintain a worldwide empire by inviting folks to a tea-party!)",9
12 March 2012,"""There was a dream that was Rome""","Historical epics set in the classical antiquity were a cinematic staple for a long period in the post war era. The genre died a death in the mid-60s, and even though big historical pictures did crop up from time to time, the Sword-and-Sandal format of Ben Hur and Spartacus seemed vanished. That is, until Gladiator. All at once, the vast ancient-world movie was back. Hollywood and the cinema-going public welcomed it with open arms.

Of course, movies don't quite look the same now as they once did. One of the biggest changes in cinema since then is not one of style but one of logistics. Back in the 1950s you could put out a call for a few thousand men, give them all a free meal and a tin hat, and hey presto, you had an army. Now, every extra must be paid properly and you just can't afford masses of them. That extras are getting their due is a good thing, but it has changed the way we make movies. It's one of the reasons why CGI became so widespread ‚Äì it's essentially a cheap option. However with Gladiator, Ridley Scott has done something Cecil B. DeMille used to do during The Great Depression, back when he was the only person mad enough to make epics in that cash-strapped era. He employs a mix of rapid editing and obscure cinematography to make it look like there's a lot more in the frame than there really is*. It's a neat trick and it works fairly well in battle and crowd scenes. The only trouble is the style is used for much of the picture, and it is somewhat tiresome to see a simple dialogue scene chopped up into a bewildering mess of shaky close-ups.

Back in the Sword-and-Sandal heyday there were certain actors who were associated with the genre. Now that the format was being revived, it would be a gamble finding their modern equivalents. Luckily, I can't think of any contemporary player better than Russell Crowe for this job. He has that rugged tough-guy look, but with a quiet dignity that is absolutely in tune with the notion of Romans as civilized warriors. While his performance does not have any exceptional moments, its strength is in his overall embodiment of the character of Maximus, convincing us that he is every inch a general who leads from the front. Also very good is Oliver Reed, bringing a bit of old-style presence to the proceedings, and a slightly pervy Joaquin Phoenix.

There is one final big difference between Gladiator and its predecessors. The older epics were almost always religious movies, with stories taken from the bible or the days of the early Christians. However, where those '50s pictures were religious, Gladiator is spiritual. There are no miracles or grandiose sermons here, just one man's very fervent belief in an afterlife. And while this is still just a piece of mythology, its context here ‚Äì the hope of reunion with his murdered family ‚Äì is incredibly touching, and is effectively what binds the whole movie together. In fact, Gladiator is arguably the first epic to achieve what so many of the earlier examples strove so hard to be ‚Äì an epic that is also intimate.

*Note that there is some CGI in Gladiator, but it's relatively minimal and is even comparable to the use of matt paintings in those '50s epics.",8
21 September 2003,"Great, most of it","I have seen 'Gladiator' a couple of times now and I still think it is a very good movie. But the more you see it, the more you notice little flaws. The story is about a general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is chosen by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to become protector of Rome after his death. Instead he becomes a slave because the son of the emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), kills his father before anybody knows his wish. Maximus is sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) and he trains gladiators. Maximus has to make the crowd love him to make it to the Colosseum, to face Commodus who thinks Maximus is dead. Most of the story is fictional.

There are a lot of good things in this movie and they almost make you forget the bad things. The movie opens with a battle between the army of general Maximus and a Germanian army. The set-up is great. We see how the Roman army is preparing for battle, with a lot of little details, and how the Germanian army arrives at the battlefield. After this the actual battle is a disappointment. Where everything looked great right before it all started, you can hardly see anything during the battle. Here the editing, cinematography and even direction or not very good. The only thing that is still great are the costumes. I admired them in every shot of the movie.

After this the real story, the one I told you above, begins. Most of the things from here on are very good. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who is Commodus' sister Lucilla and an old love of Maximus, are very good as well and veterans as Derek Jacobi (as Senator Gracchus), the late Oliver Reed and the late Richard Harris simply disappear in their characters. The animated Rome looks great and new in one way but therefor a little too perfect, too animated, in another way. The battles in the arenas are pretty good, although the last one is a little too much fiction. You will know what I mean. The ending is the one you expect, a real Hollywood ending, but it doesn't spoil the movie.

Last but not least I want to mention the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. This is one of those scores you will remember. It is perfect in every scene of the movie. This beautiful score, great acting, a fine direction by Ridley Scott and some exciting battles make this movie very entertaining and still one of the best movies of 2000.",9
21 August 2019,An Epic for the New Millenium,"Epics from the Roman period have always been a love of mine. This movie came out when I was first starting to spread my wings and see movies on my own for the first time. The film is extravagant, violent, and features a brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix (""You Were Never Really Here""), who would become a favorite actor of mine.

In short, this film was made for me.

This review is about to start sounding like a rave but there is just no hiding my love for this film. I have seen this movie so many times i can quote it in my sleep, I can describe the pacing beats of certain scenes and combats, and relate to you the moments in which the audience gasped during my first viewing. It is that ingrained into my film watching psyche.

The first place this film excels is in the production design. There are few movies who can boast the subtle boldness of the design in this film. Smashed together, we have Emperor Commodus in the most elaborate luxury, almost to the standard of a fantasy epic, and the dirty, beaten slaves, bedraggled military, and conquered hordes. The Colosseum of Rome, raining down rose petals, next to the backwater communities of Rome.

The armor, the clothing, and the buildings do not even seem to attempt to be realistic but rather, play up the theatricality of Rome, its politics, and its entertainment. The stage being set in this way prepares the audience for the themes of the film which center around virtue and honor versus spectacle and show.

The show they bring us is no slouch either. The action set pieces in ""Gladiator"" are second to none and no tow are the same. Ridley Scott brings us a variety of combat unparalleled in film. He brings us Roman military actions and formations, one on one combats, two on one combats, 5 on 1 combats, chariots vs ground troops, ferocious beasts, political assassinations, executions, and finally, the Emperor vs a Gladiator.

In ""Gladiator,"" Scott explores the many forms of violence which took place in the ancient world and the ways that they were used to both thrill audiences and strike fear into the hearts of Rome's enemies. The film not only exploits violence to keep its viewers interested, it is used to show us why it was such a powerful force to reckon with.

The final point I will touch on here is the acting. Russell Crowe (""LA Confidential"") is fine in the movie. I don't think he does anything super remarkable but he plays it well. The real show here is in the performance of Joaquin Phoenix.

Certainly one of the best actors of our day, this was Joaquin's debut performance and he does everything he can to make you hate the Emperor Commodus. His sniveling licking of wounds, vicious threats, patricide, incest, cheating, and conniving create a villain so distasteful that you hang on his every word to hear what horrible new thought has made its way down to his lying lips.

Without a powerful performance such as Phoenix delivers here, the actions of the Emperor might seem outlandish, too large and grandiose, to be taken seriously. When performed well, as here, it causes audiences to catch their breath when someone speaks a poorly chosen word in his presence for fear of what despicable torture Commodus will devise for them.

Clearly, I love this film and, as you have probably seen it already as well, I am sure you do too. It is one of those rare gems of a film which I know almost no one who does not care for it. If you aren't one for violence this movie is a pass but for anyone else, I have a hard time imagining how you could not enjoy ""Gladiator.""",10
19 September 2021,Where Great Movies Meet Excellent Films,"When you really stop to examine a great film, like Gladiator, there seems to be more to it than just the obvious qualities. Sure, it has: intense fight sequences as well as pathos, an unmatched score, a sweeping visual style, penetrating dialouge, fine performances all around including one of the greatest cinematic heros and a brilliantly crafted and acted villain. But there's something else to it, a je ne sais quoi that makes it click into place and brings before you this masterpiece.

I could probably fill up far more space commending this film and listing everything that's done so right, but most of those qualities are already known to those who've seen it. However, one aspect that seems to have gone largely unnoticed in it's more than two decade legacy, are its parallels to Shakespeare's Hamlet.

Hamlet is the prince of Denmark who's father, the king, is murdered by his uncle Claudius for the throne, setting him on a quest of vengeance. Here is where the two stories mainly diverge as Hamlet's issue is his lack commitment whereas Maximus suffers from no such issue and his problem is simply how. The two tales then ultimately reconverge at the end when Hamlet is pitted against Laertes-his rival and an ally of Claudius-with whose sister Hamlet shares a brief romance. Early in the duel Hamlet is wounded by Laerates' poisoned blade but still manages to slay him anyway before succumbing to his own wound. The play ends with Horatio(captain of the guard and one of few still loyal to the prince) standing over Hamlet eulogizing him and Fortinbras takes control declaring Hamlet a hero and ordering the guards to carry him off.

Now, I don't believe just because it plucked a few things from Hamlet does Gladiator diminish in any way. In fact, all it does(besides further proving the genius of Shakespeare) is elevate itself even higher with its literary foundation. As if Gladiator wasn't excellent enough already.",10
25 August 2019,A risk taking movie of epic proportions.,"Previously, or for the last 40 years before 'Gladiator', there was absolutely no appetite (and very little interest) for any 'Sword and Sandal' epic; so this was produced at an incredible risk. With such a lofty budget, it could have been one of the industries biggest flops. Thankfully the final realization was a wonderment of cinema and mixing some of the old time great actors, with the dynamic new. Scott at the helm was pretty much the ideal choice and certainly only a handful of directors could have pulled off, such an exciting, emotional roller coaster. Mel Gibson apparently turned down the chief role, saying he was too old for the part but Russel Crowe played it, like he was born to do so. Hail Maximus!

21 April 2018,Whip out the popcorn and get ready,"If I were to put this movie into one word it would be .. Incredible! Rustle Crowe a down to earth bloke from the land down under blows past expectations with this incredible performance. Most movies I watch I'll find issues with it being unrealistic or ""too Hollywood."" Thankfully Gladiator is not one of those movies. At not one point during the movie did I think ""this is not real"", or ""no way this would happen.""

Although this movie has a long running time I was captivated throughout its entirety.

In my eyes and that of many others, Gladiator will go down in history as one of the all time greats.

7 February 2022,Gladiator is Ridley Scott at his finest and a film that'll be remembered for decades to come - My Ultimate Review,"Gladiator is a epic historical drama set in 180 AD in the Roman Empire after the Second Marcomannic Wars. The film is Directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson. David Franzoni also produced the film and was nominated for Best Screenplay in the Oscars. But Gladiator won multiple awards, including five Oscars which was for Best Picture, Best Actor for Crowe, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It also received four BAFTA Awards at the for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Editing. Since its release, Gladiator has also been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. The writing is spectacular throughout the entire film, with almost no flaws, maybe some of the inaccuracies but that's it in my opinion, great screenplay and story, phenomenal. This is Ridley Scott at his best and the film he gave us, will be a historical moment in history.

A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.

The actors were well picked and the characters they play are extremely memorable and well written. The main cast has Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus. He has earned the favor of Marcus Aurelius, and the love and admiration of Lucilla prior to the events of the film. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus: The amoral, power-hungry, embittered son of Marcus Aurelius. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla: Maximus's former lover and the older child of Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo: An old, gruff gladiator trainer who buys Maximus in North Africa. A former gladiator himself, he was freed by Marcus Aurelius and becomes a mentor to both Maximus and Juba. Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus: A member of the Roman Senate who opposes Commodus's rule and an ally of Lucilla and Maximus. Djimon Hounsou as Juba: A Numidian tribesman who was taken from his home and family by slave traders, he becomes Maximus's closest ally and friend. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius: The old and wise emperor of Rome who appoints Maximus, whom he loves as a son, to be his successor, with the ultimate aim of returning Rome to a republican form of government.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance is astonishing and simply interesting to look at and the improvisation he used makes his performance so much better and the method acting, but it's true how Russell Crowe is the true star of the movie, both character wise and acting wise, bringing one of his best performances to the table and the one that truly made him the big star he is today, a performance that earned him an Oscar. He have even went out and said it's his favorite role and American film, you see it clearly in the performance as well. The film has plenty of performances that would satisfy anyone who are looking for memorable performances, some of them other than Phoenix and Crowe is Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed. My honorable mention is Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, he does the character justice, 100% like so many others in the film.

The costume department did something remarkable with the costumes, rightfully earning their Oscar. Gladiator won Best Picture and I absolutely think that this is among the best films made in the 2000's. From the stunning and spectacular cinematography to the excellent editing to the phenomenal musical score and finally the director, Ridley Scott. The direction, visual storytelling and decisions he made, Ridley Scott shows once again how he's one of the world's best directors in the industry. John Mathieson served as the cinematographer for Gladiator and the work he did for this film, let's just say, he deserved to win the Oscar for best cinematography as he did win the BAFTA for said award. The film also won an Oscar for best visual effects and well, just watch and see for yourselves, it's how visual effects should be used. Mixing practical with visual, it made the vision Ridley Scott had come true.

Gladiator begins with a battle, possibly among the last battles fought in the Second Marcomannic Wars. It's gritty, beautiful filmed, everything is just perfect. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's musical score makes it so much more epic and they keep that up with each scene whether it's dramatic or full of suspension, action or non. Its great on so many levels, same to say about the sound editing. But Gladiator isn't a war film, it's a revenge story about a Legatus becoming a gladiator, the fight choreography inside the arenas and especially the colosseum is impressive and I'm pretty sure the actors did their own stunts. Russell Crowe is terrific in the action sequences. The quote Maximus delivers sums up the gladiator games perfectly ""Are You Not Entertained? Are You Not Entertained? Is This Not Why You Are Here?"" That sentence shows how horrible the gladiator games truly were as the crowd were entertained but Maximus never was.

Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. He also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were ""too unbelievable"" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic. Ridley Scott managed to do just that, portraying Roman culture accurately and it makes everything so much better. Every scene has so much detail and how you notice the care placed into the said scenes, Ridley Scott created a mesmerizing film, a true modern classic. The extended version is longer but it doesn't make the film that much better, it just expands on all the good stuff and gives us more. The theatrical cut is a film I've seen a couple of times now so watching the extended cut was worth it to me. Maybe a bit too long for some people but I liked the extended scenes and the new ones. Maximus Decimus Meridius is truly a great and well written character, critics having picked him as one of the best heroes. There's so many other well written and great characters though that deserves as much recognition, Lucilla and Commodus being two. But rewatching this film again after all this time, I can't help to say that Antonius Proximo have become one of my favorites. His philosophical speeches and the actor portraying him, wonderful job and just sad that Oliver Reed died three weeks before principal photography was finished. I can't praise Hans Zimmer enough for his musical score, it's also worth noting that it's one of the bestselling movie soundtracks of all time. The ending is poetic in a way, it will linger in your mind for a long time as the entire movie will. Gladiator is memorable, epic and truly perfect.",10
6 May 2000,Russell has something to Crowe about....OWWWW!! Sorry...,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
23 October 2021,Solidly good film with many enjoyable scenes!,"Aside from a few dull scenes that slowed down the film as well as some minor elements that didn't make a ton of sense, this film was an enjoyable time for both my eyes and ears! Hans Zimmer's score along with much of the cinematography and directing of action scenes, plus for sure Joaquin Phoenix's incredible acting, made this film what it is. This is the first sword and sandals film that I have seen and I can see why some might consider it the best one!

26 February 2023,One of the best films ever made,"How some critics have slammed this film is simply beyond my comprehension. Or perhaps they are just too full of themselves to appreciate a true gem. Because that is what this film is. Possibly there might not be a historical epic like this again. 2 and a half hours of stirring moving, epic greatness. Superior to pretty much every movie of its kind. It immerses you into the world of Ancient Rome and grips you with every heart string. It plays har and fast with historical facts but when its this good, who cares? Like Braveheart without the schmultz, Gladiator is a true masterpiece, backed up by Hans Zinnerman's searing, beautiful scores.

18 May 2009,Epic and cruel,"But also humane. And directed with great proficiency by the veteran Ridley Scott. The battle sequences in the beginning are great not only in every detail in close-up plans but also in general view ones. The sound track is fabulous in some scenes. The story is intensely dramatic and well conceived. Of course historic truth is not respected nor it had to be. The artist is not a historian and when he inspires himself in History to make his work he doesn't need to follow truth in every detail providing he doesn't change historical spirit or commits grave falsehood. The artist is a creator not an imitator. His allegiance is to aesthetic values not to historical superficial truth. We know for instance that Commodus was killed by his friends and his concubine Martia and not by a gladiator who was a former general, in the arena, like in the movie but we also know that he was a tyrannical despot and he liked gladiator fights very much, having in fact taken part personally in some of them. The acting is good enough perhaps with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix which is not very convincing in the role of Commodus. A good movie in general terms anyway.",7
17 July 2010,"The very definition of ""epic"".","""The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. Its the sand of the Colisseum. He'll bring them death, and they will love him for it.""

Gladiator ignited or rekindled a fascination with historical epics for a lot of people, and rightfully so. It hearkens back to movies like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, sweeping and grand film events that go all out in taking you back to a specific time and place.

It's a very good movie. The story of a once great man who is stripped of his family and his honor and left with nothing but his desire for revenge and the gladiatorial arena, is simple and powerful. But there are two real reasons why Gladiator works so well: Russell Crowe is the perfect Maximus, and the sets are absolutely awe-inspiring. This is the closest to seeing ancient Rome that any of us will ever get, and if you weren't impressed by Commidus's entry to Rome or the scenes in the Colisseum, I don't know what WOULD impress you. Each building and battle rings of authenticity and attention to detail. 

Crowe gives a believability to Maximus that many actors wouldn't have been able to pull off half as well. He makes Maximus seem a man who truly would inspire awe among the public and his followers, and jealousy from those who feel threatened by him. There were several notable performances from this cast, but Crowe stands above them all. It's still his finest role, in my opinion.

Gladiator is the best movie that Ridley Scott has made since Blade Runner. It's impressive in all aspects, and completely deserves the lofty reputation that it has.",8
27 December 2021,Astonishing,"Gladiator's insanely brutal battles and incredibly moving storytelling assembles an extraordinarily masterful experience at the cinema. Ridley Scott's epic is certainly not perfect, but it's simply just breathtaking how striking the entire story is and how brutally astonishing the gladiator battles are, even though the high ratings suggested just that.

Russell Crowe executes one hell of an engaging protagonist, whilst Joaquin Phoenix delivers such an antagonist we love to hate! Apart from the draggy section of the film relating to the escape plan, majority of the subject matter and elements discovered in Gladiator are never clich√©d and always manage to entertain and move. Although it's worth the entire 155 minutes, it could've been necessarily cropped.

Gladiator is also very engrossing with the visual nature of it. The battles are violent and impressively realistic, but are actually a lot more absorbing than the action in other similar films. Teenagers and adults will surely never forget this masterful and very watchable blockbuster.

30 August 2021,Great film that I am happy to rewatch today,"Great performances by all the cast, good writing and pacing as well as the larger than life Ridley Scott direction with a great score to boot, its a 10/10 for me, There are few films from the early 2000's that stand out like this one, or ones I can rewatch today and still hold out.

25 April 2002,Best Pic? puh leeze!,"ok maybe I'm being unfair, this is the best picture for macho morons. This movie goes against the guidelines of most oscar-winning movies, I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, just that this film is so terrible and I must be blind or possibly missing something, but there's nothing that special in this movie (beyond the effects). I think it's sad to say that I'm actually one of the rare people that totally despises a film that most people love. Up Yours Russel Crowe!

25 May 2000,GLADIATOR RULES!!!!!!,"Not since the days of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner(for that manner) there has been a movie of such tremendous scope and power ever constructed in a motion picture of this magnitude on an epic scale. This was a far cry from the recent glorification of ""Titanic"",and it was well worth the change. I put it on the same ground level as Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"",and William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur"",but it gives more of a volucity and surroundinged then ever since Mel Gibson's picture ""Braveheart"",especially the scene where Russell Crowe's character takes on the German tribes in one bloody battle opening sequence. But the part of the colisseum in Rome is one eye-popper here,and where he battles two opponents and a man-eating tiger is well worth the admission. If I had a choice of a movie to see on a Friday or Saturday night(whether the local mutilplex or the area drive-in theatre),I would see ""Gladiator"" again,and again!!!!!! HAIL RUSSELL!!!!

27 July 2006,A marvellous comeback of the roman era movies,"Gladiator is an extraordinary classic film. Its one of those that will be watched and talked about 50 years from now. Maximus is a Roman general who is framed and betrayed. He ends up as a gladiator fighting in the great Colosseum. The whole story is about the fall and rise of the hero, an honourable man who is motivated by a thirst for revenge and a promise he once gave to the emperor. I remember when I was in school reading about the element of adventure in Greek plays. Adventure is : ""the change from happiness to misery or the opposite"". If this is right then this movie is one of the most adventurous movies ever made because it is based on this description. About the movie now, the acting was breathtaking by everyone, the directing was amazing giving the film a live, fast action character. The battle at the start of the film was exceptionally good in therms of realistic features, sound effects and especially music. Later on the graphics used to recreate the Colosseum were the greatest I had seen until that time.

24 November 2015,Very riveting and entertaining epic brought together by Ridley Scott,"Directed by critically-acclaimed director Ridley Scott comes an historical epic action flick that embraces one of the most powerful tales of revenge ever put together on screen. Set in 180 A.D, this movie follows Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe) in one of the most powerful Roman empires, who chosen by the favor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris) to the throne of the Roman republic. This sparks incredible jealous in this son Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who the emperor deems as unsuitable for the job. Consumed with anger, Commodus murders his fathers and sends an army to murder the wife and child of Maximus. Vowing revenge of Commodus, Maxmius works his way up to the gladiator rank by fighting against the most powerful spartans in the gladiator arena, and his effort eventually leads to the fight of his life.

Director Ridley Scott really outdone himself with this enthralling epic, shining more effort and incredible direction from his 'Alien' franchise. Scott polishes this film with a captivating story and masterful script that fuels with film from to start. Opening with an intense and harrowing battle scene between the Roman army and the Greek army that leads to countless bloodshed, the Gladiator boasts a story with such depth and energy, and uses some powerful characters like the main antagonist who is brought to life by the tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus frightens audiences with his cruel and unsettling demeanor, and Joaquin Phoenix boasts such energy into this character, he makes it so believable. Russell Crowe also grabs the spotlight with his performance as the main character Maximus. While the film may not have the power to fill in for its occasionally humdrum pacing, it fuels its plot with some great writing and strives a strong narrative that audiences will not be given much of a choice than to sit through it.

Gladiator is arguably Ridley Scott's best picture and one of the best historical epics put on screen. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both outstanding in this film and deserve a round of applause. This is a film is worth watching for most, but those who are sensitive to graphic and bloody combat may want to stay away from this one.",9
29 May 2001,"Gladiator is a slightly flawed, but never the less entertaining, blockbuster.","Gladiator provided one of the very few enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000.

David H. Franzoni's screenplay is adequate. It's clich√©d and doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining.

The cast does a fairly nice job at giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a great at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. He does a good job at bringing ferocity and nobility to the character of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris also give commendable performances.

Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. During the battle scenes it is effectively powerful and energetic and during the more dramatic scenes it is very sorrowful and mournful.

The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was ancient Rome.

The CGI effects are acceptable but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer.

Ridley Scott is in top form as usual; the film carries his wonderful stylistic flare.

Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction brings the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective. His editing does falter however; at times the film tends to drag on a bit too long.

John Mathieson's cinematography is one of the films poorer qualities. The camera movement is occasionally too bumpy and some of the images appear to be too murky and dirty.

Overall, Gladiator is a good film; one of the few enjoyable films of 2000.",9
19 April 2021,too long and negative,"This is mostly bad because it is too long, especially the extended version which lasts 3 hours. Then because of too much negativity, subjectivity, history. I expected more alive people like his family, more objects like poisoning and unpredictable attack of enemy, and less twists. Instead this is too much about ego, character, politics, suffering. Also end is bit empty. I expected too see the new order of Roman Empire, but instead it just ends there. Tiring, outdated or old, impractical. Reminds us of the history of that structure in Italy or Greece, whatever is it's name. And that even today such fights exist, just bit less obvious and in different way (sports, wars, competition...). Not one of the best movies, but definitely the longest one.

3 October 2010,"I personally wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but it is a very fine, bravura motion picture","The opening scenes of ""Gladiator"" are a little stodgy. The movie, like many of its genre, commences with a big battle scene in which our hero, Maximum (Russell Crowe) sets fire to a forest while storming against the enemies of Rome. The scene opens up with predictable set-up dialogue and the following battle is rather unconvincing with a plethora of strobes and far too much blurred-up slow-motion. Frankly, I also just did not care for John Mathieson's cinematography in this scene or throughout the movie (I'll agree with Roger Ebert on that note).

However, after a rather uninteresting opening, ""Gladiator"" counterattacks with a lot of bravura and a lot of kinetic power. Ridley Scott, who has not disappointed me in the cinema yet, succeeded yet again here. He just had to come back from a lackluster opening.

Following the scene I just described, Scott takes us on a (partially-true) journey in which General Maximum is betrayed by the sudden heir to the throne of Italy (Joaquin Phoenix) who smothered his father (Richard Harris) and put the penalty for the crime on the general, whom Harris had originally intended to name successor to the throne. Rather primitive motives, but Scott whips through that rather quickly and moves onto a really enjoyable saga that seems, oddly enough, more like a remake of Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" than of Maximus. He is captured by a slave trader (Oliver Reed) and trained to be a gladiator in the Coliseum. Phoenix wants to slay Maximus, but since the public goes for a tough gladiator, his only real method of doing so would be to pit him against tough opponents in the ring.

Every now and then I'm in for a good, old-fashioned adventure tale with a fairly familiar flow and a lot of technical virtuosity. All I require is that there be a competent creative artist sitting in the director's chair. And Ridley Scott, who immortalized himself with ""Alien"" in 1979, is most certainly one who fits those requirements. I think Scott realized early on in production that he did not the greatest of characterization in his screenplay and that the motives of all of the characters were primitive. It's a typical jealousy-revenge tale, so instead he proceeds to give it a lot of energy and zest. He presents us a lot of scenes in which Russell Crowe is clad in armor and forced to duke it out with other gladiators and sometimes dangerous beasts such as tigers.

I don't really have a whole lot to say about ""Gladiator"" because I said most of it when I wrote my review for ""Spartacus,"" the picture that this one most reminds me of. That also being said, I think ""Gladiator"" is a very good movie, just as entertaining as the one I just mentioned, and well worth seeing. Although personally I would rather skip over that dull opening fight sequence and predictable setup dialogue and cut right to the chase. And I still think the cinematography by John Mathieson is phony-looking and ruins some of the intended historical atmosphere. But that's just me, measuring the pros and cons. The former outweight the latter.

I probably wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but ""Gladiator"" is a very fine historical epic with a lot of bravura showmanship and kinetic energy.",8
10 August 2000,"Swords, sandals and the meaning of life","I wanted to see a Spanish language version of this just for the sheer pleasure of seeing Russell Crowe speak Espanol but unlike the French version this one was in English and subtitled in Spanish.

Well, I have to admit this comfortably sized epic moved me. despite the battles, combat and crowd scenes the focus is on Maximus and his emotions as he goes from General to slave to slave-gladiator, losing his family in the process. He is up against Commodus, who unfortunately occupies City Hall, which as everybody knows is hard to beat. After Maximus loses his position at the start, avoiding death only through outwitting his executioners)he seeks revenge not just for himself and his family, but for the ideals of his late boss, Marcus Aurelius, emporer turned republican, who had chosen Maximus as his successor but miscalculated what his son Commodus would do when he found out.

So what we get is a rather intellectual sword and slash movie, with good production values and an engrossing story.

I couldnt help thinking that even a Roman crowd would blanch at the one-sided battles in the ring. No-one would bet, yet the bookies are shown as very active. The slashing is pretty graphic and its not clear how anyone would last five minutes, let alone be able to retire as Oliver Reeds character did to beome a manager. But the end was moving.

As to historical accuracy. Im told by a real expert on the period that some of the characters are historically accurate (Marcus Aurelius, Lydia and Commodus (to some extent). There was a Maximus but little is known about him. Well so what? He enjoyed the show and so did I. Russ Crowe is definitive, Joquaim Phoenix as Commodus is a bit of a ponce but good at the evil bits. Richard Harris did a subdued Marcus Aurelius and I think we have to say Oliver Reed died a good death.",
10 May 2000,What film making is all about! Let the summer sweeps begin!,"I love the summer season for movies. Some of the best films have been released in the summer. Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rambo, Jaws, films that pack a punch. Films that are high on octane and short on melodramatic self importance like the Virgin Suicides. Chalk Gladiator up as one of the great summer films that has been thrust upon us. This film has it all, action, gore, bravado, amazing battle sequences, wonderful choreography and a rising star.

Russell Crowe has played his share of different roles but it is this one that is probably going to make him a household name. Here he is buffed and muscular and visibly toned down from Oscar nominated role in The Insider.

To review this film is really pointless. To criticize it is even more useless. If you go into this film the way many sometimes over rated-self important critics do and expect another Spartacus, is just plain stupid. Spartacus is a movie unto itself. I don't think Gladiator wants to be Spartacus, I think it just wants to entertain. And guess what? It does that with flare. There is enough action in here to please those of us that are from the Raiders of the Lost Ark school. And dare I say it, but this film is better than Braveheart. I can honestly say that my heart was pounding the entire time I was sitting in the theater. Some of the battle scenes were what I would consider some of the best ever filmed. I have to say that the opening battle was not my favourite as Scott opted for way too many close ups where he should have let the action speak for itself. But that is the only complaint. Every battle was epic, every attempted mutiny was thrilling and every sneering, wining, sniveling sound that Joaquin Phoenix uttered made me want to get in the ring with him. I can't believe this is the same guy that was masturbating a lot in Parenthood. What a resume he has for himself.

Gladiator is the first real summer blockbuster in this young season. And judging by the audience reaction to it and judging by how good it is, it should go on to be one of the big guns from this summer. I think at this point we are all tired of all the utter excretement that has been forced down our throats so far in this year, we are ready for a film like Gladiator. This is a film that is worth seeing two or three times. It is that good and that much fun.

Again, it is useless to tell you what is good or bad about the film. If you like action and violence and men beating each other until death, and ancient battles and names like Caesar and Rome and shades of Hamlet and such, and if you like to watch men get attacked by tigers and slice other people's bellies open and chop off heads and other parts of the body, then this is the film for you. If that sounds rather barbaric and disgusting, well, there is always copies of Remains of the Day and Endless Love at the video store.

1 July 2019,What we do in life echoes in eternity,"General for whom all the men who served under his command are ready to die. Gladiator beloved by the plebs of the most distant provinces of the empire like that of Rome and respected by his battle companions. Regretted lover and most especially husband and father loving in life as in eternity. Such is Maximus, the spiritual son of Marcus Aurelius, who lived according to the principles of this father: WISDOM, JUSTICE, RIGOR and COURAGE. A masterfully crafted film by Ridley Scott, who wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous movies and hired several historians as advisors. The story is carried by an epic breath, very well represented by a haunting and beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The sets, including the reconstruction of ancient Rome are magnificent. Actors and actress are beyond perfect for their roles.

The opening battle scene in Germania is on a par with 'Saving Private Ryan'. Crowe is all man, but Phoenix is awful. He's not helped by his script, culminating in the awful line ""I'm vexed, I'm truly vexed"". There won't be a summer 2000 blockbuster to match this film.

1 May 2006,Most Graphic movie ever.,"Gladiator is a obviously about a Gladiator named Maximus the Mighty.

He became one after he escaped his execution.

Being a Gladitator is a very dangerous job.

It's a game of survival and death. If you survive then you receive more credit as a Gladitator, if you die then you get a reservation at the morgue.

Maximus hopes to one day be free from being a Gladitator.

This movie is OK. Not saying it's bad, just expected better.

It's downright violent and graphic. So those who can with stand strong violence can be able to see this. I wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers or people who fear the sight of blood.",6
5 July 2022,A Masterpiece,"Among the most perfect of films. As Marcus Aurelius's evil son, Commodus, comes to power in Rome everything changes. This fictional account of a great soldier and Gladiator who stood up against his evil is at the center of this one. The acting is superior. The Direction and cinematography are masterful. The storytelling by Ridley Scott is one of a kind. See this and see it again.

And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
26 August 2002,Phony,"A phony ""superman"" movie. Big budget,impressive effects and re-creations only serve to create some entertainment value. But the simple characters, predictable plot, and totally implausible action scenes put it in the comic book category (apologies to the modern, literate comic books).

See Titus instead; a real movie with a real story and real characters, realized with the unreal magic of which films are capable.

30 December 2006,brilliant period drama,"The passionate patriotic character of Maximus is fighting a battle for Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor before his tragic death, to make Rome a better place but Aurelius' son Commodus wants to run Rome his own way.

The plots consistent with passionate emotional dialogue from each character. There are many different opinions being harassed around in different societies and through the use of battles and family story lines the film enables audience to really feel a passion behind the character's lives.

The battle scenes, sword fighting etc are beautifully directed allowing audiences to see graphic scenes of violence which conforms to the war drama genre. It's a very gripping story and reflects the context perfectly.

The costume design and setting help to conform to the time in which the film was set and through the use of old time values including slavery and money we are thrust deep within character and society values.

Russell Crowe (Master and Commander) won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and although I wasn't a huge fan of his character at certain points during the film I can tell that he acted his heart you and deserved his award for playing the emotional yet strongly determined soldier.

The interplay between the characters is also strong and creates fantastic tension for the story to thrive upon, especially between maximus and Commodus.

The passion behind each character's actions is remarkable, especially Maximus' antics. It's a truly remarkable story that reflects the time perfectly through the emotion, social values, costumes and settings (the Coliseum is tremendous) being a fan of war, period and drama genres this film was perfect and if you are into any of those genres then i definitely recommend this Oscar winning epic. i believe it is a must watch for anyone actually because it is that good.",9
26 November 2000,A Big thumbs up!!,"Russell Crowe shines in the old fashoned epic about a Roman General who is imprisoned by his rival to the throne onlt to fight his way back to greatness by fighting as a Gladiator in the collossium. This really does have feel of of a Hen Hur type epic and it deserves all the plaudits it gets. The Computer technology and the cinamatography that make up this film is breath taking as are the fight scenes. The Acting is out of the top draw but a special word must be saved for the Legend that is Oliver Reed who died during the making of the film. R.I.P 9 out of 10.

8 June 2005,"History Rewrites Itself, again","My name is Russellus Thespianus Crowus, actor of the movies of the twaddle, Star of Romperus Stomperus, loyal servant to the true hackerus, Ridleyus Scottus. Father to a tabloided child, husband to a absent wife. And I will have my LONG DISTANCE, either in my room, or down at the desk!

""Gladiator"" is one of those films which surfed into a lot of hearts on the back of an hysterical advertising campaign and then quickly faded in a foggy welter of quiet reassessment. Bad history masquerading as a good movie and now, being rendered even more laughable by the history of its star.

4 June 2000,"Very Good, but not Great","Maximus, a great Roman general commanding troops against the Germans in the second century, is chosen by the aging Marcus Aurelius to be the next emperor. Commodus, Marcus' son, and the only other person privy to these plans besides Maximus and Marcus, kills his father and attempts to kill Maximus. Maximus escapes only to sold as a slave bound for the gladiatorial games. From here, he must survive to have his revenge.

The action is very, very good, but the long scenes of dialogue drag. This is a very simple story whose best parts are the action. I must disagree with most IMDb viewers; this is not one of the best movies of all time...but it is entertaining.

22 August 2011,An epic that isn't epic enough,"Ridley Scott's highly acclaimed, best picture winning film seems to be the right formula for the quintessential roman epic. However, I wouldn't allot it quite that much praise. In my humble opinion, speaking that highly of this film would be giving it a little too much credit when it isn't that masterful of a film. It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.

This is a film I really wanted to like. I really thought I could fall in love with this film, and I thought I was during some of the epic fight scenes full of bloody disgusting action that thrills and horrifies to no end. But there's a certain dullness which saturates everything else about this film so that it doesn't quite reach the heights you are expecting it to. Basically, it is your average hero's journey with every necessary archetype standing out and moving about as you would expect. There are no surprises in this film when you really feel like there should be. This film's storyline isn't inherently bad, it just doesn't offer all that it could with a story as epic as Gladiator perceives itself to be. I found myself very bored at times and never fully being able to buy into what was going on. Maybe it was in the acting, maybe it was in the dialogue, I'm not sure. Maybe it was a combination of all the factors of this film that just left me wanting more and feeling like I had been cheated out of some great potential in the end.

But what doesn't leave you feeling cheated are the fight scenes. They are explosive, graphic, shocking, and wildly entertaining. Ridley Scott shoots the film with his frenetic display of camera angles and quick edits that make every fight scene incredibly intense and almost too much fun. Honestly, everything that took place in the Colliseum I really enjoyed. And that's only appropriate for a film called Gladiator, right? However, everything else I wasn't all that fond of. The film strikes no emotional chords with me, despite being a well constructed story that, in theory, exceeds expectations. The execution isn't perfect but I still respect a good story, and that's what Gladiator has at its core. Everything that surrounds it is a different story, though. The film just lacks true prowess and integrity to live up to its epic expectations. If you just take it as is then it's still a good film, but it could have been so much more.

I spent this entire film going back and forth between liking and disliking it. There were things I thoroughly enjoyed and thing that just left me feeling empty and careless. In so many moments I felt like I was really going to love this film in the end, but the excitement and intrigue over this film flatlines just below a level of greatness. Gladiator isn't the epic scale story of bravery and violence, but it tries very hard to be. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is a bad film, but I wouldn't give it enough mercy to call it a great film either.",7
1 January 2019,"A well deserved 10, not dated","This one should be in the TOP 15, much better than all the starved post-2008 trash (yeah - it's getting better now but the next crisis is right behind the corner so don't get your hopes up...) and nonsense like The Shawshank Rdemption (though this one is a IMDB glitch).

10 October 2022,Best Movie Of All Time,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap.

21 May 2000,"Good, but could have been Magnificent","NOTE: Before you read my rating you must be informed that as I was watching this film at the CAROLUS theatre in Nijmegen (Netherlands) at 13.30 on Saturday the 20th of may 2000 there was a constant disturbance by two people in the back, who talked all the time. Except during the break, then they kept quiet, of course. I must also say that I despise thy, thou

companions and thou friends, who spoil other peoples movie experiences, simply because thy don not appreciate the movie or because thy behave in the same way at home, where you watch movies on TV. If it is the first than, please go away and if it concerns the latter, than please, wait 6 or 8 months and rent it, for then thy can speak to thy companion and do anything you like and not spoil it for others as well!!!!!!!!!

This might have affected my final rate for the film!!!

Now for my review, of course Gladiator was good. It had a lot of action, which was brilliantly coreographed and filmed by the way, quite a lot of blood (though the film was not very gore) a great soundtrack, good actors, especially Russell Crowe (as the revenge driven Gladiator), River Phoenix (as the psychopathic ceasar) and Connie Nielsen (as the suppressed and terrorised Lucilla). But I also liked Djimon Hounsou and Ralph M√∂ller a lot. The plot actually was good too there were just 2 bothers if you ask me, first of all there are far too many boring politics involved for this action ¬ñ revenge pic, plus there are a few visions, Crowe had in this film that I found very unfitting, especially that in the end. Oh yes I almost forgot, I didn't like the ending very much. The basics were good but the was it was carried out was way too melodramatic. Standing there and stumbling for many seconds falling, then of course the FINAL words of the hero!! But there were more good than bad things here besides a lot of blood, sadness, sorrow, depression, madness, it all really made you feel for these people. I even had tears in my eyes at one point or two, just as I had with another epic film I saw, which is another classic in my eyes and funny enough has somehow a similar plot (as for the basic revenge story), Braveheart. These are the two best epic classics of the past 10 years and surely two films that may not be missed.

As you may have noticed I found the ending rather bad, regarding the rest of the film, this is also the reason, why I say, Gladiator was good, when it could have been HUGE, GIGANTIC, EXCELLENT, it could have been TITANIC!!!

But it still is a classic, so stop reading and go see it!

29 June 2000,"""We are all ultimately dead men. We cannot choose when we die, but we can choose how... so that we are remembered""","This is probably the most sadly ironic line of Oliver Reed, here in his final film role. A cut 'n' paste last scene aside, the veteran actor gives a graceful performance in a film which would see his death before completion.

Sadly, British audiences now associate the star more with a performance on Channel 4 programme ""After Dark""; where, amongst a group of chin-scratching pseuds on a discussion show a drunken Reed argued and forcibly snogged a large lady who was far from amused. ""Do you want me to go?"" questioned Ollie, who promptly did, gin in hand, when the rest of the guests begged him to leave the studio. Or maybe his most famous moment would be a slot on a primetime chat show, a jug of orange juice and vodka in hand, bellowing the lyrics to ""Wild One"".

If only for giving Ollie back his grace does Gladiator deserve praise. Direction, while derivative and gimmicky, is also well done (though it's easily Ridley Scott's weakest work). Derek Jacobi has a nice role, most famous, of course, for the mini series I, Clavdivs. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe, all mean, macho and moody with a tiny glimmer of sensitivity underneath. A bit dull for a film that lasts ten days or however long this one went on for.

The visions of the afterlife are a little bit silly, and there's never a moment when you don't know how it's all going to end. But objectively, this is a film you can admire. Subjectively, I was bored rigid and kept losing concentration all the way through. Don't mistake me, I enjoy a good epic, but there's no emotional involvement to root you to this film, and ultimately I didn't care about Crowe's character.

Sometimes the CGI is a little too obvious, already dated whereas the 50-odd year old Ben Hur still stands up. I laughed at the tiger that looked like it'd come straight out of a ZX Spectrum, and as for the dead one. I was reminded of comedian Brian Connelly. His catchphrase? ""It's a puppeeeeeeeeeeet!""

The villain is a nice portrayal of the guy that just wants to be loved. But what makes him such a bad guy? Maybe it's the fact that he kills his father, wants to sleep with his sister and has a harelip. No grey areas for Ridley. Crowe is the manly, bronzed, masculine guy that all the women love.

Gladiator is not a bad film, and I did give it a ""6"". I would have awarded a higher mark, if only it didn't singularly succeed in boring the pants off me.",6

13 November 2019,STRONG MOVIE,"Kind of what you would hope every action movie would be. Dramatic (in a good way), entertaining, intriguing, great acting, and grips the emotions very well. Romantic side of the story is done very nicely. Plot and story could be stronger but overall still a very enjoyable and insightful movie that I would recommend.

23 December 2003,Great fun,"This is surely one of the best blockbusters of recent years. Russell Crowe was made for the role of Maximus the great general and the son that Marcus Aurelius never had. There's evidence that the characters that Crowe plays best are not dissimilar to the man in real life. In this Maximus is full of hate and longs for revenge on the new Caesar.

Crowe is well supported by the rest of the cast which includes Oliver Reed's final performance. Perhaps the other thing that this will be best remembered for is the reconstruction of Rome in all it's Glory. The final speech by Lucilla is a bit over the top, but that aside this is modern filmmaking at its best.

10 May 2000,American allegory,"Even though the film is based on the same historical elements as an earlier film called THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, what we have here is an interesting allegory of the potential fall or rebirth of America.

The Roman eagle and the US eagle are obvious connections, but there are others dealing with political corruption, vicious athleticism, and ethical indifference. Unlike the earlier film, the ending here gives some hope for the future even though the historical Rome, in fact, only had about three centuries more to go before the ultimate fall due its own internal deterioration as well as the invasion of the Goths.

The FX here are well used to give us a sense of what ancient Rome looked like although some of the visuals show up clearly as fakes especially on a large screen where human beings are overly-dwarfed by CG images.

The cast is strong, and we are given a grand epic in the style of films such as BEN HUR -- but without Heston's stuffed-shirt performance. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix in particular stand out as the two opposing forces, the conflict between whom will determine the future course of history.",
5 May 2020,"Maximus, Maximus, . . !!","There is always something left to fight. We survive if we stay together. A naturally talented, tough and good man from Roman times - a general and gladiator - fights in the service of this notion.

Roman general Maximus has everything going for him. A long campaign is coming to a victorious end, the emperor adores him like a son, and he is returning home to his wife and boy. However, the emperor has one more task in mind for Maximus. The trustworthy and widely revered general is tapped to fight corruption in the capital. The plan quickly goes awry when the emperor's preternaturally ambitious and demented son Commodus seizes power by foul play and condemns Maximus to death. Through talent and luck the general eludes an untimely demise, but his family and fortunes do not. The severely wounded and destitute Maximus is captured by slavers and sent to die a second time in the gladiator arena. With a thirst for revenge fueling him, Maximus works to reinvent himself, reclaim his inherent power, and resume the epic battle with Commodus for the heart of Rome and its people.

Gladiator brings the Roman empire as well as the art of storytelling alive. Right out of the gate Gladiator held me in thrall with its eerily entrancing melody and realistic, flashy battle scene. The story and themes of Gladiator are immensely satisfying. It is hard to believe a world leader had no empathy and cared more for their ambition and image than for people, but it happened! The characters, sequences and costumes are authentic and extraordinary. The characters are cast so well with Russell Crowe (a man's man as Maximus), Joaquin Phoenix (truly bonkers, unempathetic and frightening as Commodus, who can forget his terrifying line ""am I not merciful?!""), Connie Nielsen (intoxicating Lucilla, a master political strategist, sister to Commodus and love interest for Maximus), and others including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. With seamless transitions and organization, great writing, experienced direction, resplendent photography, innovative techniques, and captivating action scenes, Gladiator fires on all cylinders. Except I wish it was darker and more daring than its PG rating standard. The fascinating models of Rome combined with dazzling special effects made me feel like I was flying over the ancient city like a modern drone. Encouraged by the film, I went to Rome, toured the colosseum and explored some of its many amazing stories from history and the present.

Haters point out that Gladiator takes many liberties with the historical truth, but the film gets the essentials right. If I see a bird in the wild, I do like to know facts about it, but more important is seeing and understanding the bird's character, realizing its beauty, and viewing the bird in the context of larger truths. While keeping with the true flavor to the era, Gladiator - as any good story does - makes us care for more important things than the design of someone's sandals or the exact words they uttered.

Are you not entertained?! Apparently, we were. Gladiator won five academy awards for best picture, actor, costumes, sound and effects. Join the chant with the 50,000 and the Roman elite in the gladiator ring ""Maximus, Maximus, Maximus!""",10
18 October 2002,Predictable and vastly overrated,"This movie was so predictable that it is disgusting. If you like fights and special effects, you are going to love it. If you want substance then go elsewhere. This movie is proof positive that the academy awards are political and for sale because this movie was a bag of dung. YAWN.

3 November 2001,Major insult to history and the viewers' inteligence,"I thought they were making a movie about Marcus Aurelius and Commodus,two of the best emperors the Roman empire ever had.But they made a movie about a non-existent General Maximus who is a mixture of Superman and Goofy.Most characters are flat including Maximus.The only redeaming qualities are a great Commodus by Joaquin Phoenix and the battle with the Germans.Commodus was called ""the first among the Gladiators"" and his twelve years of relatively peaceful reign helped the empire recover from his father wars.Joahin partly saws some of his qualities.But where is his wish for concupines?Where are his interesting religious ideas?And where is his believe of superiority of himself above all others? Is this old man Marcus Aurelius,the warrior-philosopher-emperor?I don't think so.He spend his reign constantly fighting to defend and expand the empire.He never finished fighting actualy.Rome was not out of enemies.The Picts in northern Britain,the Germans in the North,the competitive Parthian Empire in the East and the restless Arab raiders in the South hardly left him any piece.And this movie claims it was all for nothing and that a republic could be better?Absolutely not? Who the hell is Grachus?Pertinax was the next emperor and he was an army officer not a man of the declined Senate. And about gladiators they were not only slaves.Many of them were free man who were searching for glory,fame and most of all money. Why does Hollywood have to ridicule history?And what a false praise to Republics.The Roman Empire survived with its original capital between 27 Bc and 476 AD and continued to survive without it.What Rebublic ever survived 503 years?This movie is a disgrace considering it's plot and it's messages.",3
26 January 2014,A superbly crafted movie,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10

11 September 2001,My cousin loves this movie.,"Gladiator isn't such a bad movie, nor a good movie. The storyline is interesting, and so is the acting. One thing it lacks is the setting. It's always dark, especially in the beginning. One other characteristic that it lacks is a good ending. I don't want to reveal it, but it was typical. Gotta make something new. My cousin loved this movie, however.

10 May 2003,Big and epic Oscar - winner,"GLADIATOR Russell Crowe - Joaquin Phoenix - Connie Nielsen - Oliver Reed - Richard Harris

A fabulous drama film packed with brutal and bloody gladiator fights and exciting story, a really fantastic movie. What we do in life echoes in eternity

""On my signal, unleash hell"" Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) has runned into a dramatic and quality, brutal and epic. Film with supreme overall where Russell Crowe shows that he really knows how to act and with great co-working with Joaquin Phoenix as the cruel and evil emperor Commodus. Danish Connie Nielsen is also good and sadly the dead Harris does a wonderful supporting character as Marcus Aurelius. ""Roma victor!!""

STORY: The great General Maximus is the emperor's personal favourite to take over the throne, cause he thinks that his son Commodus is far to brutal. But then Commodus kills his father and sends Maximus out in the woods to be executed. But Maximus escapes with his brilliant skills and soon his trained as a gladiator, and soon he also gets the people's favourite under the name ""Spanian"". Commodus understands that Maximus is obviosuly after revenge cause of him killing his wife an d son...a hero will rise...

The movie won Oscars like Best Picture, Best Actor in Leading Role, Best music, Best director - and it was all big and important awards. The movie was the big movie in 2000 and is a coming classic with it's perfect dialog, mood and directing. Music made by Hans Zimmer and many sang by Lisa Gerrard is simply beautiful music and makes a unforgettable soundtrack. STARS: ***** 5/5",8
1 March 2009,Intense Russell Crowe and visceral action scenes in period epic,"'Gladiator' is a period epic with an amazingly intense performance by Russell Crowe. He almost singlehandedly raises the movie and makes it a must watch film. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film's pacing is slow and the story is essentially a revenge drama. Joaquin Phoenix is very effective playing the malevolent but tortured Commodus. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Derek Jacobi is good in a brief role. The opening battle scene is brilliant. The rest of the action is visceral and bloody. Some of the CGI-aided Special Effects look a bit dated but the film remains impressive.

Overall 8/10

9 June 2000,"good viewing, but FAR from great.","At least it was better than that 13th Warrior ""movie"" that came out last year... it's actually quite entertaining at time, but Gladiator is much too sloppy it seat itself on the top 100 list!

Beginning with a badly edited battle scene (what's with all the close-ups of swords clinging and such... I can't tell what the hell's going on!) and a cameo by an very, very old-looking Richard Harris, Gladiator finally shifts into high-gear when the guy starts to do his Gladiator-thing. The problem is that it takes too long to get there, and when the film's there they ruin it with ye standard old ""revenge"" plot - basically the same thing that brought down THE CROW.

Russel Crow is wooden, but there's some good supporting performances by Oliver Reed (his last performance), Derek Jakobi, and even a small role for seldom-seen actor David Hemmings (from HEROIN BUSTERS, DEEP RED, and SWINDLE) as a wig-wearing ring announcer. Ridley Scott's ""dark"" Alien/Blade Runner moody photography is out of place in the many interior and (in one case) exterior shots of Rome... which looks a bit too Computer Graphicky to buy. The high points come with the gladiatorial combat, which looks good and has some decent ideas and bloodletting, but is confusingly shot and edited. One thing I really didn't like was Joaquin Phoenix as the whiney bad guy... how would he have intimidated anybody?

The ending is highly unplausable, not to mention historically inaccurate. It's enjoyable at times, but is an overall groan-inducing experience. Not Scott's worst work, though not his best either.",4
22 July 2001,Gladiator shmadiator,"I did not enjoy this movie very much, I thought that it was a good way for dreamworks to make a quick buck or in this case a quick 200 million bucks. I am saddened that Russel Crowe won his oscar for this movie, as opposed to his excellent ACTING in The Insider. Crowe was great in The Insider because that film showed that he can ACT in many different situations, as opposed to him showing how he can try to get revenge. I think that this will be remembered as a great action movie. This was a good movie because it was grand and it was big and flashy, however some of the other movies that were released in the year 2000 were good movies, because they had meaning, substance, and they were powerful films. These movies were good for reasons other than their special effects and their director and stars. I did not enjoy this movie because I was disturbed that this film won best picture as opposed to Requiem For A Dream, which was a powerful and groundbreaking film. I do not think it was the best picture of the year, no offense to anyone involved with this film, but.. that is my opinion.

6 February 2003,A really great film,"Russell Crowe's best work (until A Beautiful Mind). Crowe stars as a brilliant Roman General who is double-crossed by a treacherous prince. Crowe becomes a Gladiator for reasons not fully explained (to my satisfaction at least) and manages to become the greatest Gladiator over a period of time (well, DUH!...it wouldn't be much of a film if he got killed early on, now would it?). The film is very well filmed and Crowe is excellent in this one. This is a don't-miss!

2 April 2001,The critics are crazy,"After having just seen Gladiator with my wife for the third time, I can definitely give it a 10. Sure, there have been better movies made, but it still is excellent in my book. The only thing I didn't understand about the Oscars is why the composers didn't get one for the score. It is perfect for the movie, and stands well in its own right. And let's hear it for Russell Crowe. He's right up there with Bogart!

16 October 2012,Very good story and action!,"This movie is just great filled with a powerful storyline and great action scenes. The cast does a very good job everyone except russel crowe I don't really care for him much but everyone else did a fantastic job. The action scenes were very intense and had your heart racing.

This movie is about a general (Crowe) who is loved by everyone including the emporer. The emporer does not love his own son however and asks maximus(Crowe) to take over as emporer once he dies. The emporers son finds out though and frames him for his death. They send the general for exectution where he escapes and is rounded up by slave drivers who turn him into a gladiator.

This movie is very good. Its a must see for everyone. A lot of people think it is too slow and too long but that is nonsense it is just perfect go watch it.

22 January 2004,Entertaining 'swords and sandals' epic,"I remember I watched this at a sneak preview screening and from the earliest shots I was drawn into the world of ancient Rome. I found all aspects of the production to be first class: the script, acting, choreography, sets, props, costumes, special effects, and so forth all successfully recreated that long past era. I'm not sure of the historical accuracy but all in all, I found Gladiator to be a truly excellent film, 9/10.

20 July 2023,"A average film, exaggerated, unrealistic and overrated!","Just like any other american war film.

Simply put in words: Too Exaggerated and unrealistic.

Can't understand the high rating on imdb.

I really expected much more! Totally overrated!

The Slow motion bits just makes it bad!

Otherwise its a film thats has set the atmosphere right for the time.

Manuscript is okey, but nothing unique. The acting is however altogether extremely good.

Music is very good!

Also a bit of confusing storyline in the first 30 minutes.

Its a film which gets better and better at the middle part of it all the way to the end.

19 July 2018,A Very Engrossing Shakespearean Tale..... Except It Is Not Based On Shakespeare!,"I'm not a big fan of epic war movies. I didn't like LOTR trilogy as much as most people did. I just don't feel invested in such stories. But I found Gladiator way more engrossing and gripping than any movie in the LOTR franchise. It's masterfully directed, edited, and acted. It's beautifully shot. It has a fantastic score. It's very entertaining, and fast paced, Ridley Scott didn't waste any time, and I watched the extended version! It has very complex and compelling characters. And above all that, it has heart. This movie has a very moving and touching story, and that really surprised me.

Russell Crowe gave an iconic performance as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix delivered a magnetic over-the-top performance as the villain, Commodus. This is a hammy performance that doesn't only fits the film's Shakespearean tale, but it also can easily be justified by the character's motives and persona.

As for issues, the pacing of some series of events at the first act that lead to a turning point in the plot was a bit faster than it should be, and .... That's all!

15 January 2001,Vivid action enthralls and repels in bloody combat,"Severed heads roll across the screen, blood spurts from torn torsos and the clash of steel swords keep the action going in a frenzy of gladiatorial combat. Film buffs who like plenty of action will find it all here and will especially admire the courage and determination of the greatest of all the gladiators, Maximus, a general who brings glory to Rome when he fights and wins the battle against Germania. Russell Crowe who plays Maximus wields a mighty sword against terrible odds. Maximus through his agility and experience and working to a plan is able to decimate his attackers however many surround him When the dying Caesar promises that the General Maximus should take over the control of Rome, the choice of candidate is not popular with Caesar's son who promptly sets about the slaughter of his wife and little son. Russell Crowe shines as an actor in the scene where he discovers the body of his wife hanging from a tree. This is a scene filled with emotion and heart-break. The remainder of the story concerns the avenging of this cruel deed. Those who dislike the sight of blood will have to close heir eyes many times during this film. The arena scenes are extremely well done on a broad canvas with sweeping views of blood-hungry spectators screaming ""Maximus! Maximus!..."" The supporting actors give very creditable performances as they get caught up in the intrigue and dirty tricks department of imperial Rome, but all eyes of course are on Russell Crowe as the sweaty gladiator, man of courage, man of action, hoping, as we all hope that good will triumph over evil.",8
9 January 2003,One of the greatest movies ever!!,"I wanted to see this movie so bad when i saw the previews but i didn't see it until it came out on video. This is one of my all time favorite movies. I didn't even know who Russell Crowe was before I saw this. Now he is one of my favorite actors. His performance is beyond great, there are no words to describe it. The entire movie is just so good, there are no cheesy or stupid scenes. it's a movie anyone can love and EVERYONE should see. And the battle scenes are really good. They are gory, but if you saw The Patriot with Mel Gibson and was okay, you'll be fine in this movie. I don't want to say much about the plot of the story because it is just so good and everyone has to see it for themselves.

2 July 2019,Starts great but ultimately suffers from bad writing,"I just want to say that I loves the first hour of this movie. The positives: the acting, the sound design, the special effects, gore, action scenes (sort of), and the production design. Thr negatives: the editing was horrendous, the script ranges from good to god awful, dialogue that feels like a B movie at certain points, and the bloody slow mo imperative to early 2000's movies. Overall it is a great prouction, and for the most part I enjoyed it. It had great scenes but overall it gets a little repititive and drags a bit with little to no story depth in the last hour of the film. Glad I watched it though

9 August 2004,YOU DON'T GET MUCH BETTER,"Ridley Scott is a total legend in film making because of 3 major films which all started a revolution ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR all of which are brilliant. Gladiator is a superbly directed movie with stunning photography and 'OFF THE PLANET ACTING' from RUSSELL CROWE and an equally as good JOAQUIN PHOENIX. Both actors worked so hard to make this film happen. This film should have taken best DIRECTOR and BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR but of course those Academy Awards ar'nt always right. At least RUSSELL got the Oscar (A WELL DESERVED ONE). The score composed by HANS ZIMMER is BRILLIANT and massively powerful. Thats another one that 'well' deserved the Oscar........ Gladiator depicts the roman empire as it were all those years ago, 'spot on', no other movie has ever displayed such power before.. HIRE this movie its worth IT!!!!!!

23 June 2013,Modern classic,"This is a wonderfully filmed classic about a roman general turned gladiator who lives to avenge the death of his wife and child.

It's a long film but it rarely drags thanks some great fight scenes and a towering performance from Russel Crowe as the gladiator Maximus. There are great performances throughout from Oliver Reed as the slave seller and an amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix as the sniveling and cowardly Commodus.

Gladiator is similar to another epic Spartacus but thanks to a superior dialogue and better fight scenes this even eclipses that great movie. It has all the ingredients a great film needs, a great cast, good story, believable dialogue, great cinematography and a great ending. There is very little you can fault this film for. Maybe it's running time but even though I watched the extended version no scene seemed superfluous.

Without doubt of one of the best films of the modern era and a film that will be much loved for years to come.",10
13 January 2006,"Its great, Scotts best","Ridley Scotts gladiator tells the story of Maximus a great roman general who Marcus Aurelius asks to take over the command of the empire. Meanwhile Caesars own blood his adopted son Commodus has other plans. Russell Crowe gives a performance which i never thought he would outclass his work in A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and THe INsider. However Crowe is magnificent in this film. He is a legendary actor for his work in these 4 films alone, thats not counting other significant performances in Proof of Life and LA Confidential. Joaquin Phoenix was also great as the villain, Commodus. Connie NIelsen and Djimon Hounsaou were also great in their roles. This film is a great fictional epic, great direction and atmosphere, brilliant cast and a good screenplay from Franzoni (King Arthur, Amistad), John Logan (Aviator, Last samurai), and William Nicholson (Nell). This movie is perfect, Scotts best work although Kingdom of heaven and Matchstick Men are great too. 10/10

25 May 2000,One of the year's best; a startling experience. **** out of ****,"GLADIATOR / (2000) ****

Ridley Scott is an master at manufacturing highly visual motion pictures with energetic, luminous stories. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" dazzled us with high tech action and suspense. Now the roman epic ""Gladiator"" vividly captures the time period and atmosphere in which its characters inhabit. This is an excellent looking production, one of the year's best. The movie is a visual tour-de-France; beautiful scenery, awe-inducing sets, convincing cinematography, and believable costume designs bring the ancient Roman Empire to life on screen.

The story, set in 180 A.D., details the bitter life of the highly proclaimed General Maximus (Russell Crowe). We first meet him as he reigns a bloody victory after combating a slew of savage barbarians. Dying roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), greatly respects his favored warrior, and even chooses he, over his conniving son Commodus, (Joaquin Phoenix), to rule the dynasty after his passing. The emperor wishes for Maximus to restore the republican government to Rome.

When Commodus perceives his father's intents, he is furious. Before Aurelius is able to explain his final demands to anyone, his own son murders him as well as Maximus' precious family, and orders his father's favorite to death. Maximus is underestimated, however, and escapes his condemnation, only to be captured soon afterward and sold into a slave camp led by the greedy Proximo (Oliver Reed). There, he and several other hopefuls, including Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), are trained as gladiators, brutal and dehumanized warriors who fight one another to the death to amuse a live audience.

""Gladiator"" contains a descriptive and clear first act. The set up and introduction defines the situations, characters, and motives respectfully. The character development is unordinary although extraordinarily effective; Maximus and Commodus are explained as the story progresses. The audience discovers more about them as the movie intertwines with perplexity. This method of character expansion devises depth and involvement within Maximus, Proximo, and Commodus and his good-hearted relative, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Russell Crowe (""LA Confidential"") undoubtedly will be further recognized as a sensational actor after his appearance as the gladiator. This determined actor conquers his role with complexity and optimal intensity. His performance is more solid than his in the Oscar nominated ""The Insider."" Joaquin Phoenix (""Clay Pigeons,"" ""8MM"") is diabolical and mischievously believable. Connie Nielsen (""Soldier"") also shimmers in her timid but decisive performance.

The confrontation scenes between Commodus and Maximus are hypnotic. The movie grants profound power when the two arch enemies discover each other's identity for the first time. ""Gladiator"" portrays its riveting characters with style and penetration; I really cared about the compelling figures in this movie.

I did find a few trifling external problems within this otherwise flawless production. The film's combat sequences are high impact, intensely believable and some of the most involving moments in movies this year. However, the camera work often deprives us from indulging in the shear graphic qualities of warfare. Sometimes the scenes are too sketchy and brief, unlike the fighting in ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan.""

In a time of the year when high-brow movies are rare, ""Gladiator"" offers clever writing, smart dialogue, involving characters, and perfect timing. This film is a feast for the senses, an overwhelming jolt of energy, a touching journey into the past. ""Gladiator"" is not merely a movie, but it is an experience.",9
31 July 2019,The best movie ever made?,"Ok I know I'm speaking in hyperbole, but this movie is SO good on all fronts. Plot is engaging, acting is impeccable, the sets and costumes are so rich and beautiful. And then the score...good lord can Hans Zimmerman ever write a compelling score. If you haven't seen this movie definitely put it on your to do list!

3 December 2000,An epic masterpiece that lives up to the hype.,"`Gladiator' is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype. Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios. With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (`Alien', `Blade Runner', `GI Jane') combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.

The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne. When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed. Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator. This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.

This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact. Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question. His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate. He would come to be known historically as the `Philosopher King' and the `Benevolent Dictator'. He was also a great military leader and conqueror. Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented. By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond. He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed. In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life. Nor was he passed over by his father for succession. Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five. He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.

It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film. There is no historical record of any general named Maximus. Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus. This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.

Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity. Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with `the mob', a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses. He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused. He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted. He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed. His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.

The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome. These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins. The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle. This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.

The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus. Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome. (For those who enjoyed `Gladiator' and have never seen `Spartacus' starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)

This film was a directorial masterpiece. Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect. Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore. Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development. This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob. It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go. Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.

The acting was superb. Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason. His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess. Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus. This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role. At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.

The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film. It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe. He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes. It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.

This film was off the rating charts. I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10. They don't make films like this anymore. Don't miss it.",10
9 June 2000,"A very expensive, very stupid, very unrealistic waste of time","What a disappointment! Total unrealism, in every respect! Could have been great, with that budget, even with that idea, but, no, the director went for sentiment (but missed), went for gory realistic fighting (but missed), just plain missed. The story makes no sense. There are big holes in it that bothered me so much I couldn't get involved. The writer tries to impose mawkish modern sentiment on the Romans. A Caesar, and Roman population, that want peace. A Caesar who wants to restore power to the Senate. A conquering general (from somewhere in the stix, who has never even been to Rome) who just wants to go home. Sensitive gladiators. Come on! Once you start seeing the failures of this film, the lack of artistry, the lack of creativity, even the lack of originality of the story (see ""Spartacus,"" for a start), you'll find little to like, nothing to admire. Crowe is nice-looking fellow, very poorly cast for the role, and cast is the right word; he has only one facial expression, sort of a sad-dog face. The producers spent a lot of money, obviously, but none of it was on research. This might as well be set on a distant planet as in Rome. There should have been ewoks. I was laughing at details at the most inappropriate times. I never felt an emotion. Trite. Tripe. Don't the people who give this film high ratings have any critical faculties at all?",2
28 May 2000,Scott classic!,"I've never been a great Ridley Scott fan. Anyone who can make GI Jane has a lot to answer for, but this absolutely excellent - the acting is brilliant (Crowe particularly), the script is OK and the effects are awesome, especially the coliseum scenes.

The only compliant is that is drags on a little long.

Crowe - a New Zealander who started in acting in Australia, got his break in the USA and plays a Spaniard in Rome - is certainly showing his versatility, despite his accent occasionally being out of place.

Joaquin Phoenix is also good, and undoubtedly the least irritating member of that family! Richard Harris did well, and the Oliver Reed pieces were also good. Despite his notoriety for his drinking, people actually tend to forget that Reed was a talented actor, and it is well displayed here.",8
21 July 2000,Frighteningly beautiful,"This is one of the best movies ,and the first Roman-epic-kind movie I have ever seen. It is powerful, the story superb and the lion scenes reduced me to a weeny cat. Incredibly stylish with computer-generated graphics, it did not look very convincing but-I know it may sound strange-in a way it adds to the intensity of the film, so CG served it's purpose. Who said violence had to look totally realistic?

The story and sword-fighting aside, I found the acting is just as good. Russell Crowe delivers the emotions very well...the best I'm-very-p***ed-off-right-now face I've seen! And Joaquin Phoenix also did an excellent job. He looked like he was born with the evil glint in his eyes. Very, Very good.

This movie is breathtaking. Go see it once or twice, you won't regret it.

7 November 2021,Enrapturing dramatization of historical accounts,"Russel Crowe had been in film before Gladiator, but it seemed he burst into meteoric stardom at that point. This film still adorns many of the top best films lists, no small thanks to Ridley Scott, of course, and the many amazing performances here by many well-regarded actors. Gladiator is always a great watch. It's perfectly paced, the costumes are spectacular, the videography is stunning, and we truly feel connected to the protagonist with the emotion exquisitely coaxed at just the right moments. Anyone who doesn't shed a tear at the end can't be trusted.

I see many reviews are compelled to say this is an inaccurate depiction. Well, it's not a documentary but a possible scenario based on the main facts that we do know and eked into a great story about one man who obviously is fictional. On a website called Welcome to Ancient Roman History Revival, the author writes in depth about Gladiator, and in part he says: While it is obvious that an impressive amount of historical and scholarly research was undertaken by the filmmakers, much of the plot is fiction. The fiction does, however, appear to be inspired by actual historical events.",10
15 February 2004,"""Commodus has issues.""","My teenage son wanted to see this film so we bought the DVD version which offers extra features including commentary by director Ridley Scott. I hadn't been interested in catching this Roman a clef flick in the theaters and two and a half hours of watching it last night underscored my original reluctance.

It isn't a bad movie but virtuous hero against mad Roman emperor has been done before in literature (from Shakespeare to Graves) and often on film. Russell Crowe's effort as Maximus (Max the General) is good but hardly empire-shaking. Richard Harris as the aging emperor is a nice almost swan song for a fine actor who, for a change, doesn't shout.

My son thought that Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, lacked a number of important qualities. When he comes on big time to his sister, Lucilla, Connie Nielsen, he remarked, ""Commodus has issues."" Commodus is everything a viewer expects from a big time villain: scheming, madness and - of course - a yellow streak down his back as wide as the screen.

The big arena fights are exciting for a while but how many heads can be loped off before a viewer has seen it all too often. The events try to recreate faithfully the exciting games once put on by the Roman Gladiatorial League with a cast of thousands (or some darn good computer work).

The commentary accompanying the deleted scenes is amusing. Director Scott explains why he left out a scene of lions turned loose on kneeling Christians by explaining that the animals were too passive as they went to lunch.

""Gladiator"" is a huge money-grosser proving that this formulaic and potted snapshot of a crucial era in western history can't be reproduced too often.

6/10.",6
7 September 2003,"Ben Hur, Barrabas, Spartacus, even Braveheart ¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö.","..............come to mind when watching this epic-style Roman Empire story. And I do not grumble about the story, nor even of its telling. Ridley Scott is obviously a highly professional director; the screenplay is worthy of the film, and the photography is frequently wonderful. Some of the sets are superb.

My grudge, I suppose, is that with so much Hollywood razzamatazz, I was falsely led into expecting something different from Russell Crowe. His performance is good, or even better. But so good as to win an Oscar? So be it: Hollywood criteria once again goes astray. Well, anyway, it is all good for the box-office.

Do not get me wrong: the film relates its story well, such that at over 150 minutes by no means did it seem too long. Battle scenes and Gladiators in the Coliseum were well filmed. Richard Harris's interpretation stands out head and shoulders above everybody else. What really makes me gripe is the music: it practically ruined the whole film. It seems that Zimmer `borrowed' (if not plagiarized) anything he could get his hands on, with pieces which sounded like replicas inspired by people ranging from Gustav Holst and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, via Vangelis and even a touch of Richard Wagner. I suppose a grandiose-intentioned epic film required music of the same proportions, but Zimmer was not inspired and has never much inspired me in his other films, especially for TV series.

A little below seven out of ten for this one, despite the several good points.",6
6 December 2021,Best historical movie,"To be honest, I watched this movie in cenima 2 times. Beside I watched this movie at TV more than 20 times. And still not fed up . I truly recommend to watch this movie if there is people still not watched this movie .

29 May 2004,An excellent movie with incredible fights!!!,"Gladiator is the most phenomanel film of 2000. Probably one of the best films of that year. Russell Crowe played his part excelletly. One of his best films!!! The fight with him Joaquin Phoenix was excellent. Joaquin was the biggest weiner I have ever seen actually. Him stabbing Russell was cbeing a true coward and then fighting him and losing was even the funny part about it. I felt like I just wanted to fight with Russell and kick some gladiator asses! This is definitley a recommended motion picture. I remember seeing this movie in theatres and having a ball. This is a very fun and entertaining film!!

17 August 2022,Apples and Oranges,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
11 April 2016,Gladiator,"Epicly April got off to a, well, epic start with my viewing of Gladiator. The Academy Award Best Picture winner for 2000 was definitely grand in scale. Ridley Scott has turned in an illustrious career making impressive films, and Gladiator certainly belongs in this category. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix lead the cast in this tale of revenge against a corrupt Emporer. A gripping tale of avenging the death of one's family, Gladiator keeps audiences on the edge of their seats through the entire 2.5-hour film.

Maximus (Russel Crowe) is a adored General for the Roman army. He is even loved by the aging Emporer Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he intends to crown Maximus Emporer over his own blood, Commodus takes this as the ultimate betrayal. After murdering his own father, Commodus assumes power, as no one knew of Marcus Aurelius' intentions to crown Maximus. Commodus then goes on to condemn Maximus to death and sends henchmen to murder his family. Defying odds, Maximus escapes his execution and hurries back in an attempt to save his wife and child. Too late to save them, Maximus is taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator. Maximus gets through his days by hoping that he will eventually be able to exact revenge against Commodus and fulfill his own Emporer, Marcus Aurelius', dying wish. The day finally comes in which Maximus' gladiator troupe is called to fight in the coliseum of Emporer Commodus to participate in a marathon of gladiator challenges. Joining together with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) who wishes to bring democracy to Rome, and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) daughter to Marcus Aurelius and sister to Commodus who bore Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) heir to the throne of his Uncle and is deathly afraid of her brother, the gang of misfits attempts to bring about the demise of Commodus.

Gladiator looks like the spectacle you would imagine it to look like. The sounds and score were perfect for the film and made you feel like you needed to wipe the sand out of your eyes because you were so involved in the action. My favorite part, like others I'm sure, was the scene with Russel Crowe fighting the tigers in the coliseum. The scene looked like reality and thankfully wasn't bogged down with CGI. Russel Crowe played the brooding warrior exceptionally and was matched in talent with Joaquin Phoenix's sanctimonious turn as the self- righteous Emporer. Gladiator was a real tour-de-force as far as the acting was concerned. Another stand out was the stark colors sprinkled throughout the film, especially in the costumes. Janty Yates certainly pulled all the stops designing the costumes worn in this epic and was more than worthy of her Oscar for Best Costume Design. It is the scenes in the coliseum that show just how many extras were used in this movie and acts as further proof that Ridley Scott more than deserved the gold statuette for Best Director he took home from the 2000 Oscar ceremony. Everything came together so well in Gladiator that I can more than see why audiences and critics alike have few negative words for this film.

Gladiator is driven by the vehicle of revenge. Maximus wants nothing more than to kill Commodus, both because he is responsible for the death of Maximus' own wife and child, and because it was the wish of Marcus Aurelius for Commodus to die and Maximus to take the thrown. Seeking revenge gives Maximus' life purpose after his escape from death and the loss of his family. Maximus' laser focus on revenge fuels every aspect of Maximus' day and one is left to wonder if this idea of revenge turns into an obsession and if it is healthy. Granted, Maximus gives his life purpose with the goal of revenge, but he is set upon killing which never seems to right any wrongs. The theme works in this film and is paced so well that the audience is engaged throughout the entire film. I am happy that a month of viewing epics had brought me Gladiator, a film I am guaranteed to see again and again.",9

25 February 2003,One of my all time favorite films,"What more could you want? A powder keg of a performance from Russel Crowe as a scorned general turned gladiator seeking revenge for his family's execution, an expertly recreated view of ancient Rome, a darkly comic performance from Phoenix as the villainous and terribly vexed emperor, a ""hey, look at me I'm hot and a great actress"" turn from a virtually unknown Connie Nielson as the emperor's conniving sister and Crowe's love interest, taut direction from a seasoned director (Ridley Scott) who knows something about pacing and action and visuals, an amazing musical score from Hans Zimmer, awesome costumes and sets, and tons of blood and carnage, all make this one of my personal all time favorite movies. Some of the CGI make look dated in years to come, but I don't think I could ever get tired of this story oft-told, but not oft told this well.

9 June 2018,One of my favorite movies ever,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

3 August 2018,"The definition of an epic, powerful movie","Gladiator is well deserving of its legendary status. Both Crowe and Phoenix are just exceptional, both with a case for among the best performances I've ever seen. The score was amazing, the cinematography and scene progressions were impeccable, and the plot was very satisfying. Rather than the symbolic, complex idea-driven movies that I often praise, Gladiator is a tour-de-force that has a truly grand feel. Gladiator is one of the best movies I've ever seen and will always be my prime example of an epic, glorious movie.

6 June 2000,One word: SPECTACULAR!,"I saw Gladiator last Saturday and I was completely blown away by it. Russell Crowe is fantastic as General Maximus, who is betrayed, becomes a slave and later a gladiator. When he is a gladiator, he seeks to revenge his wife and son, who were brutally murdered by the the new emperor. There are spectacular battle- and fightscenes in gladiator, great characters(both hero and villian), a blockbuster-soundtrack and also a great story. I can`t recommend you enough to see this movie. This has to be one of the best films in 2000.

26 December 2008,A good film in it's own way,"If i live to be 100, i'll never forget Gladiator. a film that feels so modern, but takes place in the time of B.C., where Rome reigned over the world and 25% of the population lived and died under the rule of the Caesars.

Our hero is Maximus, a General who possesses a superb ability to survive anything. he doesn't die no matter what happens. when he is asked by Marcus Arelius, to become the emperor of Rome, But he declines. this leads to the throne being stolen by Commadus, the Corrupt and immoral Son of Marcus Arelius, and opening the great coliseum for gladiator battles.

This movie has a basic level of gore, and it's more fun to watch than an adult film cause of that. with the gore aside, this film has a modern feeling to it. everything about it feels modern. it has a WWE kind of feel as well, with maximus being like stone cold steve austin and Commadus being like Mr. McMahon. Bottom line, it's just good.

16 March 2001,"Good movie, but a great one?","""Gladiator"", the movie favored to win the Oscar for Best Picture this coming March 25, is an epic movie that I found to be just good. I didn't think it was a great one like most people thought it was. Certainly not as great as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"", which ""Gladiator"" is no doubt inspired from. The good things about this movie are the two main performances by Russell Crowe (Maximus) and Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus), the action scenes in the Roman Colosseum, and the beautiful film score. All those elements get high marks. The cinematography, editing, and production design are very good as well. But if there's one element that keeps this movie from being a great film is the lackluster special effects. The effects aren't all that great here. Even though they're not bad at all times, there were some effect shots that looked obviously phony. That shouldn't happen in a film like this. Nevertheless, if you like historical epic movies, then you'll probably like ""Gladiator"". I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't the great film I thought it would be.

4 November 2009,Shadows and dust,"Up until a few years ago, the Notting Hill Coronet was my favourite cinema in London. Not because they showed anything particularly special, but because, for a long time (and this sounds amazing now), it was the only cinema in the capital which still let you smoke in it. I even saw Hannibal there, and a couple of dodgy Shyamalans, just so I could savour the sensation of lighting up in an enclosed public space.

The best film I ever caught there, fag in grateful gob, was Ridley Scott's sword 'n' sandal smash. Before the turn of the decade, if you'd told someone you were making a movie about gladiators, they'd have laughed in your face, and quoted that line from Airplane! back at you. So to turn such a laughable genre into pure gold, one of the most purely entertaining films ever made, is no mean feat.

Neither is what I did on June 10 2008, around lunchtime, when I decided, after 20 years faithful servitude, to smoke my last ever cigarette. Just typing that feels weird. One day at a time.

5 May 2000,"Absorbing, but sadly flawed","I found the movie a totally absorbing experience; the impact of Ridley Scott's direction was masterful and yet I left the cinema sadly unsatisfied-as if I instinctively felt that the genius-direction had passed over Gladiator but had not rested, leaving the product more commercial than great.

Professionally I know a reasonable amount about the period of Roman history and excepting a few parts where cinematic license was indulged, the movie could be taken as accurate.

I don't think that any actor could do more justice to the lead role than Russell Crowe; his brooding presence matches the enormity of the script's inevitable outcome.

The film is definitely worth watching.

23 July 2018,Ridley sure can direct,"Re-watching this after several years has caused me to revise my rating upwards. I must have been over-influenced by reading the silly one-star reviews. This is an inventive and fictional tale, set in imperial Rome, with one or two actual historical characters. Unlike phony Braveheart, it in no way sets out to distort actual history. It is exceptionally skilfully directed, and the narrative never lets up. Ridley seems always to get the best from his actors. One of the least boring epics I've ever watched. Ridley Scott can turn his hand to any genre. Miles ahead of Kubrick: it's as if he is saying: I see what you're at, Stan, let me show you how to do it. Sometimes it steers dangerously close to excessive emotion, but time and again avoids bathos. Excellent script and dialogue. Visually masterful. Great movie.

7 June 2000,Brilliant acting,"I expected much before I saw this film and as every film fan knows; you should never expect things before you see a film. So, I didn't like ""Gladiator"" as much as I thought I would, but I still think it's a good film. It's interesting, the action scenes are great (the opening battle scene is reminiscent of both ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), the drama quite interesting, and the acting brilliant. Of course, Russell Crowe has never been better (I haven't seen ""The Insider yet, though), and we all know how good he was in e.g. ""L.A. Confidential."" Joaquin Phoenix doesn't play a very likable character, Commodus is a pathetic loser, but he does a good job with it anyway. Recommended. (7/10)

Slow, uninteresting, goes on forever, with its ""Roman times"" time period veiling it's many ""Friday the 13th""-ish type moments of slashings, gashings and blood spurtings. Production values are very high, but I can't sit through so much pre-historic dialogue. I'd love to use the line I was so glad-iator when it ended, but I only made it through an hour of this yawn-fest.

Also excellent acting from both leads, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Unfortunately we get the usual Hollywood emotional overdose. Without it we would be talking about a masterpiece. But we're still talking about top-notch entertainment. Don't watch this film in a non THX/DTS theater, you'll miss half the experience!

14 May 2016,Timeless,"Gladiator is one of those movies that will never be outdated. It will never need to be remade or need anything else done to it. It stands on its own like few other movies do. Crowe's performance as Maximus (I think I spelled that right) is subtle and stoic, yet perfect. He is the perfect hero archetype and it ends fulfilling that archetype perfectly. The story, whether how accurate it is to ancient Rome or not, is incredible. Even if we must view it as a fantasy film, the story would not become diluted in any way. If you have not seen Gladiator, you should go buy it at a F.Y.E or Moviestop location (it's very cheap now) and if you have seen it then I'm sure you agree with me and if you have seen it and don't agree with me, whatever, but you're absolutely wrong.

9 May 2000,Spectacular!,"Ridley Scott has breathed new life into the sword and sandal epic with Gladiator. Using modern visual effects, Gladiator shows us a Rome that hasn't been seen since, well Roman times. There is a thriving metropolis and at the center of this mass of humanity is the coloseium. Ridley Scott's films are wonders of art direction and costume design and Gladiator is no exception. The sumptuousness of Rome in its heyday is wonderful to look at. With all of the eye candy that Scott gives you, you almost forget that there is a story unfolding, and it's quite a story. Russell Crowe gives a strong performance as Maximus, the disgraced Roman general. Juaquin Phoenix is perfectly sniveling and underhanded as the newly crowned emperor Commodus. There are scenes of quiet treachery and intrigue and then there are scenes of blood stirring combat in the arena. Gladiator is an epic that spares no expense in giving you thrills from ancient Rome.

21 January 2013,Gladiator ‚Äî A violent and grandiose clash of titans in the ancient grimy world or Rome,"Gladiator has it all. A great story that, even with the old revenge idea, will pick you up and plunge you right in. Gloriously grandiose shots that will fill your eyes and your imagination. Acting that will never take you for granted and just give you real emotions. Dialogs that are well thought, and will only be simple if it fits the scene or the character. Smooth editing and excellent score to be bettered only by the best. And, finally, action with grimy characters that gives this movie the heartbeat of a titan.

The opening scene is particularly exceptional. The intrigue gets going pretty quickly putting our unwilling hero in a real and fatal mess. Each piece of the drama is put in place carefully, until everything comes together and the clash happens. It's one of Ridley Scott's great movies.

Russel Crowe is the perfect hero, Joaquin Phoenix is truly mad, and both are irresistibly aimed at each other. Connie Nielsen play a very frightened sister that's at the same time courageous, yet worried about her son.

This time, I tried listening to it with a very critical eye and I found only the last moment of clarity of Maximus, when he gives his last order, to be a weak and somewhat artificial moment. Beyond that, unlike him, I would have bent my neck right away, and plotted after, but that's a personal decision. It would have killed the whole paradigm right away and made me less of righteous a hero than him.

Anyway you dice it or slice it, it's a must see, unless you have difficulty with violence.",10

20 December 2012,here is a roman classic,"The movie moves in the realm of depression and just stays there. Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.

Filming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.

The movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor.

Based squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni's original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.

The movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire. The gladiator aspect of this movie can be said to have been gotten from the movie Spartacus.

Gladiator was a critical and financial success and it won 5 Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards, the awards were Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best sound.

Gladiator is a classic movie that gives you the fun to see the Roman Empire as some believe it was, rough and full of politics, here is another shelf nominee.

4 December 2002,"A stirring, action-packed epic.","8 out of 10

Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose family is slain when he refuses to swear loyalty to the new emperor (Joaquin Phoenix). Sold into slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator, and upon proving his mettle in combat, plans his revenge against the emperor as he begins to win the audience over victory after victory.

Visually stunning and brilliantly directed, this epic tale does come up lacking somewhat when it comes to plot, but the film is so meticulously crafted and exciting, it's hard to care. The gladiator battles are the movie's highlight, never copping out when it comes to explicit violence and brutality. A sequence involving chariots and surrounded gladiators is an intense, bloody fight to the death. Expect tons of visceral satisfaction if gory combat is what you're looking for.

But those wanting memorable characters and heart will also be pleased. Russell Crowe's powerful performance brings genuine emotion and drama to the screen, you can't help but feel for the man's pain. Hans Zimmer's score is his best to date, alternately rousing and emotionally satisfying. Don't be surprised if the music is enough to induce you to tears. Gladiator has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, laughs, and ambition. This is in every way a stirring epic.",
23 May 2000,Very Barbaric,"This movie is very Barbaric. I LOVE IT! I love these kind of movies. When I started to watch it even at first it had a lot of action. The beginning was really cool. It got sort of boring at times. But not that boring. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good action, kick butt, gladiator movie. I'm a big action, kick butt, gladiator movie fan.

The acting was superb, some of the acts will be well remembered. The designs, the camera work were all amazing and it showed that they put a lot of effort into this part to really immerse ourselves and make it feel like we're really looking into the past. The story was pretty good with solid pacing and some decent characters with it too. A solid history movie with excellent action scenes and great dialogue.

Overall an enjoyable movie.

10 February 2005,Parallels with the Degeneration of our American Empire,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7

The opening 10 minutes are right on the money, right up there with 'Saving Private Ryan'.

The scene play adapted for the movie is very well written.

This movie does not disappoint and will be watched time and time again.

Gladiator is a 2000 historical action/drama film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe portrays the loyal General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son Commodus (Phoenix) murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor. While Gladiator was criticized by historians for its historical inaccuracies, its epic scope and intense battle scenes won praise. The film's success may have helped to revive the historical epic genre, with subsequent films such as Troy, Alexander, and Kingdom of Heaven, the last of which was also directed by Scott.

18 December 2021,Actor Russell Crowe's Best Movie,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
15 August 2001,I only found the fight scenes and the sets to be decent; nothing more,"If it weren't so damn overlong and overly-wholesome, GLADIATOR would have been a winner in my book. The film overstays its welcome because of all the hype, and that's what I didn't get. Most of the performances (especially by the star, Russell Crowe) weren't that good as I

expected, plus the extremely long time length of the film was a

downer, and this movie won the best picture of 2000?? The Oscar

committee was far too generous for GLADIATOR, that's for sure.

I thought the only saving graces in the film were the intense action sequences in the battlefields and the arena, plus the costumes and landscapes were fantastic. But sometimes the minor details are indeed minor; they didn't help to buoy GLADIATOR from sinking.

13 February 2001,"Bombastic production, old-fashioned story","It¬¥s impossible to stay unimpressed from this gigantic epic. ""Gladiator"" is full of dramatic, emotion and suspense. Watch this film on a big screen at the cinema and the sets, costumes and the sound will catapult you out of your seat! The cast is excellent - especially Joaquin Phoenix as schemer Roman emperor. However I was disappointed about the leading actor Russell Crowe, who was in my opinion too reserved for this role. The second problem is, that the story lies somewhere between ""Spartacus"" (Gladiator fights against the Roman empire and becomes the hero of the nation) and ""Quo vadis?"". At last there is nothing really new in this film, it¬¥s more a remake of the old ones - just with a better technic, better FX and a higher budget. Today I heard on the radio that ""Gladiator"" is nominated for 12 awards... what made my think of that there are ""better"" movies which also would deserve an Oscar. ""Better"" in this sense that there films which have more original ideas and which are not only pure commercial products like this one is! However, you won¬¥t be disappointed by ""Gladiator"". If you like bombastic cinema - watch this! It¬¥s just a film that is made more for the eye than for the demands. (8/10)

18 October 2009,"drawn in by the war scenes, fascinated by the arena scenes, and captured by the valor!","Convincing and invigoration as all suspension of disbelief is snuffed in the opening treacherous battle of Germania 150 AD. Russell Crowe is commanding as heralded Roman war general Maximus whose moral compass is clearly fixated on family, strength and honor. His rescue from the dead is enthralling, if only to be enslaved as a potential Gladiator whipping boy. His story of revenge, catapulting him to the grand arena, seems as inevitable as his determination is contagious. Despite Crowe's Aussie accent and the pubescent and down-right creepy portrayal of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) all performances are come off empirical allowing the plot to develop, boil, and close with an every mans' belief of an afterlife, the soul of his mission.

2 March 2007,Not the classic it wishes it was.,"With Oscar weekend just passed I decided to dig out a film that had won loads of Oscars, and nominated for even more. I went for Gladiator, a flick I hadn't seen for at least five years, which five years ago I remember thinking wasn't anything special.

And apart from the action sequences, that view still holds. Sure, the coliseum scenes are something special - possibly some of the great action scenes ever shot, but they are let down by a mess of a film, full of bad dialogue, gaping plot holes and bad acting.

Russell 'I can only do one expression' Crowe, is perhaps one of the films biggest let downs, he can't decided whether he is a emotionless bad ass, not giving a damn whether he dies or not, or whether he is an emotionally fragile man. I've never been a big fan of Crowe, but especially in the role of Maximus, I feel it is one of the film's hindrances.

The dialogue is camp and cartoony, with one of the first lines ""Why can't people just admit when they've been conquered?!"" appearing completely inappropriate for a savage battle scene. Throughout the film the dialogue is one of the recurring problems, which makes itself apparent when it appears self-aware or over-sincere (""You must live or I shall die"").

Also, we're meant to believe that Maximus can escape the Roman army and travel undetected from Germania back to Spain, but wait he can't escape from a shoddy little slave ring. Its plot holes like this that mean that Gladiator can't be the classic it badly wants to be.

However, it does have quite a few redeeming factors, such as the fact that it is really well directed by Ridley Scott (his choice of panning camera shots and brilliant intimate feel to the battle scenes have to be seen to be believed). And Joaquin Phoenix is spot on as Commodus, never choosing to portray him as a straight bad guy, but the most multi-dimensional character in the film.

Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is great too!",6
23 July 2000,Ridley Scott is back,"There are several context to this movie: the art of war, the struggle for power in an impossibly large empire and the visual grandeur of the ancient Rome. Ridley Scott has put the emphasis on the visual and on the use of power and the use of the masses to sustain and control this power. Very clever, and ""Gladiator"" is an exceptionally powerful film, albeit a bit overlong and even slow at some points.

The visuals are fantastic, I couldn't really see anything that revealed the ancient Rome to be a model or a computer simulation. The war scene and the fighting scenes are amazing, my guess is that the brutality shown here is a bit meeker than what the real thing must have been - the Romans were the worst kind of barbarians, civilized and advanced and yet thirsty for blood. But then again, maybe that was Rome's way of keeping their enormous population in check? Give them spectacles, give them something to shout at, to focus their frustration and anger at - and be sure to point that away from the emperor's palace.

""Gladiator"" goes to considerable lengths to show how a weak emperor loses control over the crowds and how his vision of the empire crumbles before his eyes - this is all very well portrayed.",8
3 April 2001,"Overall good, but not great!","After all the hype, I finally got to watching Gladiator, and overall the film was good, but not great.

The main problem with the picture is that the characters are so underwritten, only Connie brought depth to the film. The acting was fine, but I wish more time was spent on the story and dialogue.

The film's direction is stunning, despite a lacklustre script, the film looks fantastic. The special effects are excellent in parts, but sometimes it looks too good, and doesn't fit!

The score is fantastic, great stuff, the waltz material will blow your mind.

Overall, a disappointing screenplay, but great popcorn stuff!

18 September 2002,A Comeback For the Ages,"People love a comeback. They might just be our favorite storytelling archetypes and contain the most relatable and inspirational narrative tropes: vulnerability, failure, trial, redemption and eventual triumph. Gladiator is an epic comeback in more ways than one.

First, it is the story of a comeback: unfairly disgraced Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russel Crowe) is exiled by mad Emperor Commodus. Reduced to slavery, he earns his keep in the arena, and fights his way to the Colosseum in Rome, and to revenge. It is as streamlined as storytelling comes.

Then, it marks the comeback of director Ridley Scott after a series of flops and artistically underwhelming pictures. It also sees the return of a genre confined to the dustbin of cinematic history since the failure of the bloated Fall of the Roman Empire over three decades prior (which incidentally also told the story of a general fighting a redeeming battle against mad emperor Commodus). How odd that a studio might pick a director best known for science fiction to tell what is on paper essentially the same story as that famous flop?

Galvanized by techniques first deployed in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, Scott chose to stick to a straightforward, almost very by-the-numbers script and immerse us in the arena. And immerse us he did. From the first shot to the last, Gladiator is a lean, mean, single-minded brute of a film, punctuated with quiet moments of tender beauty. The bloody fights in the arena eclipsed anything seen since, and the Rome depicted was intoxicatingly real, far removed from the stagy creations of old.

Serendipity was, as it so often is, essential to this film's success: original star Antonio Banderas - the main reason the screenplay alludes to our gladiator as ""the Spaniard"" - jumped ship, and paved the way for revelation du jour Russel Crowe, fresh from L.A. Confidential. While Banderas is a likable, charming lead, it is impossible to imagine anyone else but Crowe as Maximus: he fits the role and the story like a glove, hard as nails but also deeply wounded and at times even gentle. It earned Crowe not just an Academy Award but super-stardom. Luckily that was not enough to completely eclipse revealing turns from Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix as the mad emperor, or first-rate work from departed veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, the later particularly haunting as gladiator-trainer Proximo.

Throughout, Scott's visual mastery speaks for itself, and his seasoned collaborators all produced some of the best work in their respective careers, from set designer Arthur Max to composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose epic score truly did echo in eternity as the ad campaign promised.

Gladiator is Hollywood at its best: old-fashioned storytelling executed in a vibrant and awe-inspiring way.",10
3 July 2003,"Amazing, epic adventure with great performances and fight sequences alike","Russel Crowe won his first Oscar for playing gladiator Maximus, a Roman soldier betrayed by the emperor's son Commodus (Jaquin Phoenix). Maximus is forced to become a gladiator, fighting and slowly gaining the respect of the Roman public.

Crowe's performance defines drama, as the heavily reluctant and equally mourning Maximus. Phoenix almost matches Crowe's brilliance, but over-acts a little in some scenes, losing a possible Oscar win.

Aside from the fabulous acting there is also the perfectly choreographed sword battles. From the beginning raid on the barbarians to the climactic Crowe vs. Phoenix fight scene, the battles, and everything else in ""Gladiator"" for that matter, never disappoint.

6 April 2001,HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?!,"Initially, I didn't want to comment on ¬ÑGladiator` at all, but now, as it won so many Oscars, I think I should:

How could that happen?! How could Hollywood sink so low and nominate this monstrous combination of pure commercial thinking and perverse blood lust for twelve Academy Awards, especially Best Actor and Supporting Actor (???), Best Writing, Best Director, Best Music and ¬ñ Best Picture? Or is the Best Picture nomination only a result of the number of other nominations?

It really hurts seeing how the American audience ignored the terrible way history is treated in Hollywood. Ridley Scott commercialized the Ancient Rome so obviously that one might believe he meant it ironically. But the movie is deadly serious (as is ¬ÑOscar-winning actor` Russell Crowe who moves his face I think three times during the whole film!), so we are really supposed to believe that Maximus the Gladiator was Christian and hoped to meet his family again in the Hereafter. The whole story is so dumb that even eight-year old children should say they are too old for such nonsense.

It is no argument pro Ridley Scott that he gave a second birth to the genre of the ¬Ñsandal movie`. The real Roman movies were historically more accurate, more intelligent and not so overloaded with glaring computer-animated visual backgrounds. Those were movies. ¬ÑGladiator` is more like a videogame. An absolute disgrace happened on March 25th. It showed how poor in quality pictures the year 2000 was.",4
1 April 2020,Gladiator is an excellent drama and war film.,"To me, this is an inspiring movie, a tale of a man fallen in disgrace because of others , that managed to redeem himself in history once again.

25 April 2001,I cannot believe that such a film is a year's best movie,"I cannot believe that so many people don't understand anything about actors, plots, timelines, actually everything important to have a good movie. Gladiator is NO good movie! A suggestion: Have a look at the Goof section and find out why. Most people don't want to use their brains while watching witted action films. Now, they've got what they want: a cool main actor, a cool story in a very cool time, but they don't consider that mostly everything in this I-don't-know-how-to-name-it-film is wrong. And then these people who don't understand to read, or even to WATCH a movie come here and rate this ""masterpiece"" of human creation on rank #95. Well, I know why they do it but it's hard to accept their stupidity... What a cramp!

1 July 2016,"Historical accuracy not much, but an amazing project non the less.","With Gladiator be now about half of a generation old I though it was time to review this great flick and the impact to the movies in general. As it is quit known it is a fictionalize as Game of Thrones ,but unlike many historical movies that doesn't bother me much for this flick literally brought the interest for the classical world and let's face it the movie is *beeping* awesome and from the setting alone it is shown the huge work it was put into the project.

The story is center to the Roman General Maximus Desimus Marinious ,who after the Emperor Commodus ascends the throne ,he is betray by him and now he has only one goal in life, to kill Commodus himself! The great think it is that though heavily fictionalized the characters ideals and way of thinking is compatible with what Romans had as base for their behavior. They performance although, which are all great don't harm the either! My only small complain is that the gladiatorial fights aren't very accurate (but are awesome) ,dispite that what saves them from criticism is the big budget which make the spectacle nothing short of wow inspiring.

Now to the main subject of this review, the increase of mainstream audience for the classical era. When Gladiator came out ,the common people wasn't very kin in Classical history and often dismissed it and studios also didn't give much interest to the sword and sandal genre thinking of it a think of the past. Then this flick made 457,6 million dollars world wide and won five Oscars ,so after EVERYONE wanted a piece of the pie. This renew interest brought us HBO Rome, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, 300 and so on. Now it also borough and awful creations like Gods of Egypt, the remake of Ben-Hur and some more, but if this the price for the people to get started in learning history so be it.

Over all I have a soft spot for this film and it truly make me go find out more about the people who ones lived and their actions, tragedies and greatest achievements. Like it or not Gladiator make history mainstream in the pop culture.",9
14 January 2001,Awesome!,"My only regret about this movie is this: I wish I'd seen it in the theater instead of waiting for it on video (I was very bad about seeing new movies this summer). I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen the full effect.

Because this is a BIG movie. And to that end, it's excellent. The sets and costumes are incredible, the characters are well established, and the action scenes are amazing. My only problem with the story was that I think there must have been a better way to explain the main political conflict, as the action literally has to halt in order for the characters to explain what's going on. Other than that, I enjoyed this movie. Although I'm not sure if it'll be up for best picture, it at least gets my honor of the year's most quotable movie.

""That vexes me. I'm terribly vexed!""

23 March 2012,A Shakespearean epic.,"This movie is pure Shakespeare. I hadn't seen it in years and tonight was my first time watching it in Blu-Ray, which just elevated it to an even higher plane. All of the technical aspects of the film are wildly impressive. The costumes, the sets, the score, the cinematography in particular was an astonishing achievement. So many shots felt like they were paintings, the actors working on some master artist's canvas. Ridley Scott crafts an epic tale of the warrior Maximus, but it's interesting how intimate the sets themselves are. The battles take place within arenas and almost the entire film is in dark hallways, cells or rooms within large structures. Even the big battle scene that opens the film is on a small field, yet Scott is able to give the film such a grand scope. It speaks a lot to his skill as a director.

The blending of fantasy and reality, as Maximus is constantly looking into the afterlife, reaching out to be with his slain wife and son, is seamless and beautifully touching. We are given an inside look into what Maximus fights for, and Scott's direction is so clear in delivering that to us. It's truly some of the most precise direction I've seen, working from an immaculate script by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson. The fact that this was an original script still blows my mind. If I had gone in not knowing that I honestly would have thought that it was a Shakespeare adaptation of some play I had somehow never heard of. Dipped in themes as old and violent as revenge, betrayal, incest and battles both physical and political, the film feels like it was ripped straight from the man himself. The dialogue is some of the best of recent years, poetic without seeming like it's trying too hard, memorable without ever becoming unnatural to it's characters.

It's all played out by a tremendous ensemble, highlighted by the explosive force that is Russell Crowe. He turns Maximus into a stone badass, but in his eyes you can still manage to see a warm and honest soul. He's a good man who is forced into a dark place and the result is someone you would never want to have coming after you. As the man he's going after, Joaquin Phoenix is the ultimate slime, having so much fun in the depravity of the role but also managing to bring a surprising vulnerability to the part. I was very caught off guard the several times that I actually felt bad for his Commodus. The battles are wildly entertaining, appropriately violent and so immaculately choreographed, as is to be expected on a Scott production. Working in this genre is just another example of the superb diversity that both Scott and Crowe are capable of, and guiding this achievement is both men at the absolute top of their game.",9
8 May 2000,"Great movie in all respects and if THIS film doesn't make the world sit up and take notice of Russell Crowe, nothing will.","This movie is a visual masterpiece, maybe Ridley Scott's best work (and that's saying a LOT). I must admit that I was not that impressed with Joaquin Phoenix at first, but on further review, I realized that he was actually very good... his character is a spoiled simpering evil dude, and he played it to the hilt, with a British accent (because we all know English was the language of Rome, and everyone who was anyone in the Roman empire spoke with a Royal Shakespearean accent). Oliver Reed, Derek Jacoby, and Richard Harris were wonderful of course, as was Djimon Honshou, and then there's Russell Crowe... He is definitely the heart and soul of this film, and if THIS film doesn't get him the respect he's due, then nothing will. And anyone who thought the light saber duel in Star Wars Episode I was impressive (as I did -- my favorite part of that movie) will be completely bowled over by the fight sequences in this film. Very bloody, but very well choreographed and incredibly filmed. AND -- this movie has a heart! The characters are well-developed and the plot (yes, there's a PLOT too!) hinges on the relationships between them, not just on the action. A great movie in all respects.",10
24 May 2020,Great Epic Historical,"It's been forever, and I truly mean forever since I've seen a historical epic like this. I know that some people might get bored of them and maybe it's because I haven't seen a lot but I really like them! Usually, I start with what I liked about a movie and then move onto what I didn't like but I'm going to do it the other way today. The things I didn't like about this movie were the slow-motion scenes and the heavily edited fight scenes. That's honestly it. Moving on to what I did like, one thing that immediately stood out to me was the set design and costume this felt similar to GoT to me in the sense that I really felt like I was there and that I was watching a historical piece. I loved the atmosphere the movie sets up, giant sprawling landscapes and mountains. The whole place feels dusty, lived in and blisteringly hot.

Next, by god the score in this film was amazing. Triumphant in times it needed to be but also with tinges of sadness and mourning and loss when it needed to be. They use a couple of themes over again but I think this is one of the situations where it works really well. You really feel for Maximus as he goes through this journey. They make sure you understand he has some moral code but that he is still willing to fight for and kill for what he believes in.

Finally, HOLY S**T THE DIALOGUE IS AMAZING. I mean it! If you removed the gladiatorial fighting scenes from this the story would still translate quite well, and it's all because the dialogue is perfect. There was a moment or two that I could feel a bit of it being from the 1990s but for the most part, it was done really well. Russel and Joaquin are both amazing protagonists and villains due to how well they're played out on screen. One is a warrior who is just trying to go back to his family, another is a son of royalty who would give it all up for a hug from his dad. If you're into giant fight scenes and a don't mind a bit of choppy slow motion and quick editing then I would absolutely recommend this to you.

Also ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED is a classic line.",8
3 May 2000,The summer starts with this triumphant Gladiator,"This is not Braveheart, the war drama about Scotland's quest for freedom. This is a character study, a comic book, a video game. Ridley Scott and his screenwriters find intelligent ways to give us everything we would ever want to see in a gladiator film. It doesn't aim to teach or evoke pathos, but to entertain like the gladiators themselves. To the film's credit, it does its job admirably.

Russell Crowe is back from Jeffrey Wigand and returns to raging Bud White mode. He carries the film in a breath-taking stride, even though his Aussie-accent is difficult to cover up at first. Joaquin Phoenix is the best costumed villainous fop since Tim Roth of Rob Roy.

And the battle scenes are rousing, combining the violent red-throated carnage of Braveheart with the you-are-there shaky-cam of Saving Private Ryan to impression results. And the film actually FEELS like Rome, a feat that for all their glory (varying though) Spartacus and Ben-Hur haven't been able to muster up as they've aged.

Gladiator is a terrific way to spend two-and-a-half hours and one of the best non-stop action flicks since Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Terminator.",9
26 May 2000,The first great epic blast of the century,"I first discovered Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential and although I was disapointed in it, I thought he was brilliant in The Insider. He returns to brilliance as Maximus. Wonderful cast, settings and acting. Joaquin Phoenix steals every scene as the ruthless emperor. Although his character is weak, he plays it very well. Pay full price for Gladiator, you will not be let down. Definitely worth some Oscars next year!

4 April 2001,TOO MUCH HYPE,"I haven't seen many of the films that came out last year, but there's no way the AMPAS is telling me that GLADIATOR is the best one of all of them. Anyway, I thought the movie was okay. I don't think I'll ever forget it, but it wasn't that good. What I like was the sense of masculinity I felt while watching it. The costume design was awesome, the score was good, and the set decoration was also good. But the cast was sort of boring, the characters didn't have a sense of humor and all of them were always bitter and they all act the same. Russell Crowe did a good job though. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's character weeps and wines too much; how could a great cesar raise someone who's the exact opposite of him? And how come he is always kissing everyone? And the battle scenes could've been better. I didn't enjoy them too much because they're built on messy close-ups of blood rather than strategy. No one in the audience could tell what's going on during the fight scenes because the camera was always pointing in the wrong direction and when it was pointing in the right direction, the scene would change chaotically. For example, when the horses on the chariots kept crashing, I was too busy trying to figure out why they're crashing instead of enjoying it. And the sound kept skipping too! I thought HOLLOW MAN should have won best visual fx instead. But who cares!",5
23 April 2020,Tragic legend,"The film began in the winter of 180 AD, according to the prologue of the head of the photo. At that time, the Roman Caesar-Marcus Aurelius, hereinafter referred to as the old emperor, after two decades of war, Rome reached the peak of power. To North Africa and north to southern England, the beginning of the film is the old emperor led the army to the Germania of Armenia, the Germans are retreating, the latter is already a war in the urn, and the general of the northern Roman army Maximus Maximus prepared for the army in the early morning. , Ready to give the Germans a final blow.

At the beginning of the film, the first shot was given to Massimos 's hand. Even if it was watched for the first time, the audience subconsciously could reflect that it was the protagonist 's hand. The person in the shot was walking forward while stroking the wheat ears in the field. Wheat is the most important crop in the Latin region of the Mediterranean. That person must be on the farm. With light and sad humming, people subconsciously reflect this story as a tragedy. Next, I immediately switched to Massimos dressed in a uniform, with a snow-covered back and a cold wind, and the fur cape on my shoulders couldn't help but flutter. It was a flat shot. Generally speaking, the shots we give to heroes are usually Looking up, the shot for the villain is usually looking down, but this plain flat shot makes people understand the director's style: I am just a narrative person. And the war is imminent, why is this person absent-minded and his eyes flickering? Next came a bird flying away. The person stared at the bird and showed a pleasant smile, as if envious of the bird. The above are all foreshadowings. When I watched the audience, I suddenly realized that the director had explained the most warlike general in Rome from the beginning. He didn't like to fight. He just wanted to go home to farm. He was a very simple soul.

The troops are ready to attack, everything has been arranged properly, and only the soldiers who persuaded the surrender to bring back a message. As always, Massimos observed his troops in the trenches, on the one hand, to observe the status and morale of the soldiers, and on the other hand, to tell the soldiers that he was by their side. When the soldiers saw Massimos coming, they all stood up, and they all showed relief smiles and respectful eyes. From here, they knew that this general was extremely prestigious in the army, and won the respect and trust of the soldiers. In the soul. Even though he was so tired, seeing Massimos came, he still had to stand up and put on a ready look before the general, so as not to disappoint the general. After reviewing all the way, Massimos came to the deputy and told the deputy that the troops were tired and hungry and no longer wanted to fight. The implication was that if this were the last battle, the troops might not be able to sustain it. It took too long. Here again shows that Massimos has a very rich experience. After a few observations, the status of the troops can be known. Then the adjutant said that the range of the catapult and the front sight were not set in place, and it might hurt the cavalry around by mistake. Massimos said that this error was acceptable. Next, we saw why he personally led the cavalry around. To put it this way, he not only has rich commanding experience, but also has a lot of experience in battlefield charging. He knows how not to be hit by his own catapult during the charge, which is within his control.

The persuasion soldiers had their heads cut, and the Germans came out of the woods to call for battle. Massimos immediately realized that the persuasion failed and immediately prepared to charge the cavalry. First, it was a routine, to encourage morale. Don't disperse the formation, don't be afraid of death, you are doing glorious things, and the tone of the soldiers makes the soldiers laugh, which also confirms that he finally said, ""They said that the god of death smiled at everyone, all you have to do is laugh back."" Then from the rear The Germans were plagiarized, the battle continued for a day, and the Germans were wiped out. In fact, from the comparison of the lineup of the two armed forces at the beginning, we can see that there is no suspense in this battle. The old emperor sat in the rear army all the way, and after the battle came to see Massimos, ""What should I reward the greatest general in Rome?"" ""Let me go home."" Massimos confided his voice, which was also his The goal I hope to achieve throughout the article has never been achieved. The old emperor did not immediately answer him. Such a good general, the emperor must have a heavy trust. How could it be possible for you to go home? Massimos gave his reason: ""This battle is over and no battle is over."" It means that I am a soldier, and I should have gone home if I did not fight. The emperor also gave him the reason: ""There are always battles"", which means that he has more and more important things to entrust to Massimos. Over the years, the two have had a tacit understanding, Massimos understand At this point, I do n't know what the real intention of the emperor Lao Er is.

Space is limited. Forgive me, I will only talk about Massimos, not to talk about the prince Commodus, the empress Lucia, and the emperor Lucius. After returning to the barracks, Massimos first thing was to go to the tent to see the wounded soldiers, and chatted with the military doctor. Here we can see that he cares about the loss of troops and horses before and after the war. He is not like the elders. A politician is not like the royal dignitaries. He knows the essence of the war, and he knows every trouble in the middle. Back at the celebration feast, the prince Commodus invited him to serve for himself, and wanted to win him over. Massimos did not give a clear answer; the senator told him: ""You hold a heavy soldier, you will have considerable political power to speak."" Meaning The army listens to you alone, don't you have any ambitions? Want to ""share great things with him"". However, Massimos did not reply directly because of the occasion. If he was on the battlefield, he estimated that he would have killed these chewing people. From here we can see that on the one hand, Massimos is in control of the overall situation on the battlefield and is invincible, but politically he knows nothing at all and does not want to participate in these things. In his logic, the soldier is a soldier, It's okay to fight the battle well. There are so many broken things.

Early the next morning, Massimo groaned with his brothers at the camp, but he could not have breakfast with his brothers today. The emperor summoned him this morning and asked him to go to the emperor to camp. From this, it can be seen that his military career was spent with his own grass-roots soldiers, which explains why the soldiers have such a good relationship with him, so listen to him. After seeing the emperor, the emperor was still writing his own diary (Marco Ole remained in his own twenty-year Rongma career and has been writing a diary, sometimes as a memo, sometimes as a dialogue, this diary is right Later generations have a profound influence, whether it is important for future generations' life, or historical archaeology.) The old emperor pretended to be mysterious and asked him why we came here. Massimos did not understand the meaning of the old man. In this regard Massimos will not work anymore. The old emperor's political attainments are also estimated to be extraordinary. He has a clear level of speech and sets up many institutions. Fortunately, the old emperor liked Massimos. If he wanted Massimos to die, Massimos probably died without reacting. Massimos replied: We are here to conquer the land and glorify Rome. This is a very orthodox subordinate answering the tone of the superior. The old emperor obviously did not let him report to work, so he set aside the first layer of cloud and began to suggest to the topic, roughly meaning: ""I am old, Massimos, In the twenty-four years of my reign, I only brought four years of peace to the people, and the remaining twenty years of war. What will people think of me in future generations? Does my life make sense? ""Massimos probably does not hear the emperor for the first time. Tucao was born, and he knew that what the emperor wanted to say was coming, so he planned to follow the emperor's words. The emperor interrupted him and went to bed, meaning that we let go of our fears and opened the skylight to speak brightly, but not ourselves. Say, let Massimos first say that political literacy is evident. Massimos goes straight, you let me say, I said, ""I brought five thousand people, but two thousand could not go back, the rest Thousands of them died after a half, and they fought for Rome. ""He narrated his beliefs, as well as the beliefs of the troops. He thought all this was meaningful and did not want the emperor to doubt himself. The emperor gave a new question: ""What is Rome?"" Massimos further said: ""I have been to many other places, dark and savage, Rome is like light."" From here, Massimo Si is truly loyal to Rome and truly recognizes his motherland. This is the old man testing his inner loyalty to the motherland.

Then the old emperor began to enter the real purpose, let Massimos talk about things in his home, this is not a dialogue between the king and the minister, but a dialogue between men. As soon as Massimo talked about this, he smiled, and his eyes were shining. This seemed to be the topic he was most interested in. Here, seeing that the thing he cares most about is his wife and son, he was absent-minded before the beginning of the war and was thinking: ""This It's the last battle, I don't want to overturn the boat in the gutter, I haven't gone back in a year, I don't know if my son will ride a horse, I don't know my wife ... ""And the emperor Obviously he heard the answer he expected. After testing wheth",8
23 May 2000,Russel WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MESS!!,"So this is how I start my summer movie bonanza. Looking forward to Russel and a good story and some big budget action to produce serious eye candy.

How disapointed I was soon to be. Gladiator is an unfortunate rehash of the same ole good guy revenges against evil and of course it's ALWAYS the evil one's love interest that is in love with the good guy. This movie falls into that same ole trap, and none of the actors and actresses have anything to work with. Everyone seems fine, Crowe who is normaly dynamic and plays interesting characters is uninteresting cause his character is the same banal hero in every BAD revenge movie out there. Joaquin Phoenix as Commudus is ok he seems like the only person in the film who looks like a Roman but he's BORING. It's not that they are bad, it's that their characters are so stereotypical and bleak that there's nothing interesting about them. And then of course it plays into that HOPELESS cliche when the weak evil guy we all know how pathetic he is, will try to defeat the hero in a battle we know he will loose. WHY??? cause he's a looser. Gee couldn't figure that out..

So then I would think at LEAST there'd be some good action in this picture.. Wrong again.. Sure some of the battle scenes are neat, but I found them boring and they were hampered by the BIGGEST complaint I have with this picture. This film was SOOOOOOOOO darkly shot that I could barely even make out the characters faces. There is nothing wrong with this effect but it was used so poorly here that the fight scenes were chaotic and blurry (I found my eyes jumping all over the first battle scene), to the simple dialogue scenes where I could barely see even the characters eyeballs.

Historical inacuracies?? Probably several, do I care? No. I went to this film for the entertainment value and it didn't even give me that!

Disapointing

28 May 2000,"Good but not great, in fact...",".....the more I think about it, mediocre. After so many duff movies since Blade Runner I was sceptical that Scott had suddenly become the great auteur we once expected of him after the afore-mentioned android epic. And so it proved. The direction is frankly awful in the first half. As an executive once said of 'Heaven's Gate', there is scene after scene of beautiful images, but no film. Too adverty, too many filters and irritating slow-mo. Curiously for an epic, Scott shoots a lot of the film in close up which does not work. How did Crowe escape execution in the wood? Damned if I could work it out. The close up and fast cutting of the fight scenes proves disastrous too. Why do it? Because it's in vogue, so forget personal directorial vision. Ben Hur is years old but the fight scenes here pale in comparison.

Why did he choose to film the whole thing as if you are seeing Rome through light tinted sun glasses? Perhaps to create a disconcerting atmosphere of facism, but the overall effect is one of mental illness. Rome was sunny, that's why they managed to hold games for 120 days in a row. The constant squinting at sepia soon grows tiresome. The ending was moving but it's going to be if you cynically go for the film making by numbers approach. It's routine, push the buttons stuff. Why did he insist on having music playing in the background throughout most of the film? It's a comman complaint against documentaries at the moment and is distracting here as well. Just give us a sense of reality for a moment, please. The use of (I think) Holst's 'The Planets' is el naffo as well.

Classy actors are used as window dressing. Crowe is one note. Despite the hype, Oliver Reed is given little to do. It's not a dead loss, the strange atmosphere is compelling, but there's a sense that contemporary film makers have forgotten how to tell a story and could care less. Check out Spartacus as a reminder. Great performances, especially Olivier, and a cracking script too. For those who want to see a proper historical epic, see Tarkovsky's 'Andrei Rublev.' It's awesome.",
16 August 2010,"A potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion.","The release of Gladiator helped significantly in consolidating Ridley Scott's reputation as a master filmmaker. His best two works are still Alien, and Blade Runner made in the early 1980s. But Gladiator has been a cause of optimism for Scott, a box-office success, as well as being nominated for twelve Oscars, bagging five, including best picture. It's a confidence booster for the premier director whose works in the 1990s have been mediocre by his own towering standards.

A visual spectacle, Gladiator combines elements from Spartacus, and Ben-Hur, and is made in the tradition of classic epics, but enhanced with modern special effects technology. The result is a potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion, set in medieval Rome. The level of cinematography accomplished is of the highest standard, capturing Rome in astonishing detail, yet with a certain degree of credibility. The film is 2.5 hours long, but Scott keeps it tightly paced, without going overboard with fancy editing.

Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix provide the two supporting pillars, carrying the bulk of the film on their shoulders, giving a powerhouse, and devilish display respectively. Gladiator would only be half as engaging without Hans Zimmer rousing, grandeur score. It's a perfect complement to the visuals. Gladiator comes at a crucial time when the epic genre seems almost non-existent since Mel Gibson's Braveheart. It started a trend of similar films such as King Arthur but those are cheap offerings that makes us appreciate Gladiator even more.

31 August 2000,We need more Roman Epics these days!!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is an excellent portrayal of a hero, and a very good film. The opening sequence was just fantastic and the battle/fight scenes were cleverly choreographed.

This is a story about good versus evil but it is told so well. Russell is excellent as the hero, General Maximus Decimus Berilus, and Joaquin Pheonix plays the villain, Commodus, exceedly well. His character wasn't over-the-top evil, he had emotion, and his hate seemed to stem from his resentment of his father and Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Commodus was evil but there was a great contrast of his wanting to be loved and accepted, and his suspicion of the people surrounding him. This made for excellent story-telling and added depth to Commodus!

It was great to see Richard Harris in Gladiator as Marcus Aurelius. Actually the whole cast was brilliant but it was truly Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott's film! Russell Crowe manages to portray Maximus' stern loyalty and strong sense of justice with ease. We admire Maximus and loathe Commodus- both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix become the characters. This is an great film and well worth seeing! All I can say is, they should have more Roman Epics. And this film has got enough action and drama to entertain, and with performances and direction to match! Although this is not Ridley Scott's best film (it comes pretty close though) - it certainly adds quality and variety to his resume. Great Stuff, **** out of *****!",8
27 November 2022,ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED 0_0,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8

19 May 2000,Disappointing to the maximus!,"This film is stunningly bad.

Russell Crowe is so wasted here. And Connie Neilsen could be beautiful so much more entertainingly somewhere else.

The sound is muddy, the effects attempt what they can't deliver, and the script is so relentlessly incredible that not even Crowe's acting and Neilsen's astonishing good looks can rescue it.

The initial battle scene, like so many, is ridiculous. The opposing forces are cheaply miniscule. The Romans chose laughably bad ground (downhill from the enemy!). And the ease with which the Romans position there cavalry behind the opponents is absurd. It was nice, if incomprehensible, to catch Scott's homage to the great film, ZULU -- the Germans seemed to have the Zulu battle chants down pat.

Most annoyingly, Scott seems to think that an occasional spray of blood and a sickeningly jostled camera equals Big Action. More like Mild Nausea. We see much of this, alas, later in the movie, too.

OK, so we grant a little geographic and medical license to Maximus as he rides, wounded, across much of Europe, to find his family murdered. But from that moment all credulity must be withheld. Since when does a Roman citizen place himself in jeopardy of being impressed by slave traders just because he makes the grave error of being unconscious? It might have made more sense if he'd woken up belowdecks on a British ship of the line in the 18th century.

The climax of the film, though momentarily pleasing in the accuracy of its downbeat rendition of one's chance of succeeding in a plot against a Roman emperor, once again dismisses credibility: Commodus thinks he'll do better against a genuine heavyweight than Johnny Friendly did against Terry Malloy. Or imagine Al Gore suggesting that he and George Dubyah settle this thing mano a mano. Same idea. Puh-lease.

The film was kind of a pagan BEN HUR, but without Jesus, the horses, the (real) crowds, and any significance whatever. And it lacked, especially, a crazy emperor like Caligula of the ROBE movies, played in his film debut by the brilliant Jay Robinson (""Messalina!""). Too much post-modern dysfunctional family stuff among Scott's Caesars.

Yuck.",1
2 January 2013,One of the best historical epics,"While more ""serious"" film buffs and film critics don't like Gladiator very much, I, as an history buff, have special interest in ancient Roman history. It is perfectly true that Rome didn't became a republic in 182 AD, and this film can be understood more as an exercise of alternate history. Though is suffers from anachronisms, in terms of dialogue and history: Marcus Aurelius says that he expanded the empire, while in truth he didn't expand it, he only maintained the borders against the pressure from migrating Germanic tribes.

Another problem is the fact that Rome never had grain reserves maintained by the State, or at least didn't have according to the historical evidence, and a line o dialogue says: ""he is selling our future"" when the emperor sells the grain reserves, such anachronisms plague the film and are an important flaw but I don't think that they merit the removal of a full point of the film's score. The dialogue and the characters are not the most complex ever but are executed well enough and this is enough. Excessive complexity and pretension can kill a film.

Overall, I highly recommend this film to those people that love films but don't have any great pretension. More more artsy types shouldn't see it. For the benefit of both the public that liked it and themselves.",10
8 May 2001,Worth seeing again and again!,"Even before seeing this movie in the theater I fell in love with the score. Once I saw the movie I knew I had to add it to my collection. This was the only movie I had to see in the theater more than once. As soon as it came out on DVD I bought it and watched it over and over again. The plot is awesome, the effects are absolutely amazing and the score pulls it all together magnificently. The added documentaries and features on the DVD set are well worth watching again also. I highly recommend this movie for anyone's collection and also recommend checking out Hans Zimmer's other works.

2 January 2001,The movie was awesome!,"I have not seen a movie about gladiators since I was a teenager. I have always wondered why don't they make movies about gladiators like they used to. Oh, well when I hear that ""Gladiator"" was coming up last summer, I thought. That is going to be a hit. I believe that when I read that Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane) was directing it I knew the movie had to be good. I knew nothing about Russell Crowe ""Maximus Decimus Meridius,"" Who is the Gladiator himself, perhaps because his name was not all over the place as it is now, I have movies that I am watching and I go? : Russell Crowe! The movie at hand is romantic, full of good principles and ""biceps"" combined with great fights. I enjoyed the movie very much. I am trying to leave people's private lives outside their work. I thought that Russell deserved the Golden globe nomination that he has received and wish him the best in his career and private life as well. The Gladiator brought to mind many Biblical Characters, such as David, Saul, and specially Daniel. The movie was awesome! Favorite Scenes: Russell's hands passing through the tall grass. Really cool images. Favorite Quote: Juba: ""Can they hear you?"" Maximus Decimus Meridius: ""Who?"" Juba: ""Your family. In the after life."" Maximus Decimus Meridius: ""Oh yes."" Juba: ""What do you say to them?"" Maximus Decimus Meridius: ""To my son -- I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business.""",8
8 October 2001,A respectable and fairly engaging Roman epic.,"A respectable and fairly Roman epic about a much beloved Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who instead becoming the next emperor of Rome is forced to be in the gladiator fights, which were fierce and...a bit on the bloody side. The strongest parts of this Ridley Scott film are the excellent fight scenes and the performances of veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming). Only the appearence and design of Rome look very grainy and unpleasant. I have some doubt why this movie received some Oscars that included Best Actor (Crowe, no offense) and Best Picture. The only nominations that this film should deserve are Best Supporting Actor for Reed and Djimon Hounsou instead of Joaquin Phoenix (brother of the late River Phoenix).

14 August 2001,A great story.,"The story is about Maximus who was a general in the emperors army,but after his friend Commodus betrayed him,he became a slave and had to fight for his freedom.

This movie got lots of action,great story and of course great actors.(what more can you want.) I hadn't seen to many movies about the Roman empire so this one just blew me away. The fighting scenes is awesome,especially the ones in Coloseum.

This movie is absoulutely among my top ten movies,and I would recommend it to everyone.

23 May 2021,Slow Start but Really Picks Up as it Goes Along,"The movie begins with a really great action scene and manages to consistently remain exciting, at least when there are action scenes. The movie kind of falls, at least for me, when the film try's to be moving and heartfelt, luckily those moments aren't too frequent and as I said the action manages to remain interesting throughout. The cinematography is pretty good and I really liked Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the pathetic, childish villain, Russel Crowe also gets a good performance in too. The sound design was slightly cheesy towards the end and I thought that family aspect, without getting into spoilers, wasn't given enough time to make me really care about it. Still a fun viewing experience with some really memorable moments.

16 September 2023,Gladiator (2000) Did he deserve the Oscar?,"At the 2001 Oscars, ""Gladiator"" won best picture. Was it fair? For many people this award was fair, but I strongly disagree. Ridley Scott's direction doesn't work as well as in other films of his career, it seems like he directed it with his eyes closed. The film is very long and it is not entertaining during the entire time. The pace is very confusing, at times it seems to want to tell the story slowly and at others it ends up speeding up scenes that deserve more development. However, Russell Crowe's performance is incredible, he gives himself completely to the character, just like Joaquin Phoenix. It's not a bad film, but I think it's mediocre and doesn't deserve the best film award.

18 August 2018,You'll be GLAD to have seen this!,"This movie won Best Picture for 2000, which upset Roger Ebert. He thought the movie was murky looking, had bad special effects, mediocre acting from Russell Crowe, and he brought down his rating for historical inaccuracies. (Says the guy who praised Brave heart and The Last Temptation of Christ-both of which are great movies.""Was he not entertained?"") His co-host at the time disagreed and called it one of the best movies she had ever seen.

So do I, but not very highly.(It's on my favorite movie list but near the end.) I am not bothered by historical inaccuracies, only major biblical ones.(Speaking of which, this masterpiece is from the director of Exodus Gods and Kings.) The action makes this fun and that's all that counts.

If you enjoy Ben-Hur, which won Best Picture 41 years prior,you may like this too, because this has a similar plot. Both are about a person enslaved by a friend, and that person wanting revenge. While Crowe's character does not meet Jesus and does return for vengeance-unlike Ben-Hur, the movies share similar plot structures.

Gladiator is fun, action packed, and thrilling. While I prefer Traffic, I do think was worthy of winning Best Picture. It's well worth seeing.",10
25 May 2017,Epic,"A great historical adventure of epic scale. From outstanding cinematography, great acting performances (especially by Russell Crowe, Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix) to a really good plot, including all it takes in the genre: great battle scenes, intrigues, interesting characters. This movie has all it takes to be the kind of classic it already is. Especially the gladiator fights are breath taking and stand the test of time, rivaling Ben Hur's great chariot race. To top it off Hans Zimmer writes one of the most beautiful end credits songs to a very moving ending. Outstanding film-making by Ridley Scott. Especially recommend: the Extended Version with several additional scenes.

19 May 2012,one of the best epic movies ever made !,"I love this movie , it has all of the basic elements of a epic ! Destined to be a classic, from the incredible acting to the costumes. Pure perfection , Tony and Ridley Scott really captured the essence of the Gladiator movies ! It definitely was worthy of every Oscar , it received ! Russel Crowe's performance as Maximus was as stellar as Charlton Heston's in Ben Hur. There was a only one part of this movie, that really got to me. And that was heartless merciless murder of his family. I broke into tears, but despite that depressing scene. It is still one of my all time favorite movies! I would definitely rate it an A +! But due to minor suggestive scenes this movie is not for everyone. But if you like action till the death and some blood shed , then this is the movie for you!

6 May 2000,Predictable melodrama,"I'd been looking forward to seeing Gladiator, since reading a review in the TIME praising it to the skies. I was disappointed - the story did not touch my heart. I think ""BraveHeart"" had a much better story and characters. I did not feel much empathy for the characters and the love story left me cold. The endless chit chat between the ""Roman"" characters was so boring with the dialogues utterly ordinary. The special effects were ok, but nothing extraordinary. Similar melodramatic stories have been seen by me ( as I from India) millions of times before. Wife, sister, parents, brother or son murdered and the hero taking his revenge. I would advise others who are praising the movies to the skies to start watching Indian movies. They will really lap it up. I also found the ending a big let down. The climax was so meek !! And I here I was expecting a big showdown between the the armies of the rebels and the emperor. Russel Crowe has acted well, but I believe any of our homegrown Indian superstars can give him a run for money in the melodramatic and action sequences. I found Joaquim Phoenix and the lady awful. The Gladiator isn't awful, but it's not particularly memorable either. You may want to see it to satisfy your curiosity, but not if you're concerned with getting value for your money.

19 February 2001,Win one for the gipper...,"Ridley Scott is a much misunderstood director. His trademark style is to create movies with purposely ""one-dimensional"" characters, most of which are not very likeable... and to distance us from them rather than bring them in closer. The reason he does this is so we focus on the film's (always incredible) atmosphere and (amazing) visuals.

Now, some may say this is ""style over substance."" Not quite right, it is style *AS* substance. A good example of plain old ""style over substance"" is the movie ""The Cell."" That one is all style, no substance. Gladiator, Hannibal, Blade Runner, these films are (mostly) all style, but the style *IS THE SUBSTANCE*. The atmosphere these films create, the way they make you feel in your gut, that is the substance!

Is there something wrong with that? Film is an art form, and who ever said every movie has to tell a deep, complex tale with warm characters we can all relate to? Sometimes, a film is all about style... it's a visual medium, isn't it? Do all paintings have to be of people?

Many people are never going to appreciate Ridley Scott's kind of directing... it's usually a ""love it or hate it"" kind of thing. Anyway, you finally deserve one of those golden paperweights, Ridley, go grab (at least) one!",
30 May 2001,"Cool special effects, but...","Kinda like a poor remake of the '60s Fall of the Roman Empire"" with a bit of ""Ben Hur"" mixed in.

With a poor story line.

Historically foolish.

O.K. great special effects...

It'll look VERY tired in a few years.

Watch it, it's fun (but best on big screen).

23 May 2002,Greatest action movie ever,"This has to be the greatest action movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The action is great and the fight sequences were just awesome. I especially like the fight with Russell Crowe and the guy with the cool mask and axe and sword. If you don't know which one was that, that's the one with the tiger. All of the other ones were really cool especially the slaves against the warriors. That was cool and that arrow lady gets it good. Really good. The one with Joaquin Pheonix and Russell Crowe was very good. The acting between everybody was good and Russell Crowe deserved that Academy Award. I think Joaquin Phoenix should have gotten it, too. He was really good as the villain.

Overall the entire movie was great and I recommend this to everybody. This is by far the coolest action movie I've ever seen. Rating 10.5 out of 10. (Third favorite movie)

20 September 2000,Hated it!,"This movie's popularity is completely inexplicable. It is basically a pastiche of cliches from every historical epic ever made. The basic premise - a man's loved one's are killed and then he gets revenge on the sneering villain - is reminiscent of everything from Braveheart to Ben-Hur. The only bright spots are the performances of Russell Crowe, Derek Jacobi, and the late, lamented Oliver Reed, but the film is so awful, who could care?

12 December 2005,My Favourite One,"Gladiator begins with a war scene that is one nice steal of masterwork which gives you goosebumps from the beginning. Also the fights of Gladiator as slave are brilliant and suspenseful. The film is probably more appreciated if you're interested in Rome and all that has to do with this former empire of the Earth. Not only Russel Crowe but all the actors did a great job. I especially loved the role of Commodus though he is the bad guy. A mighty character, but then again, not almighty. The scene where Gladiator and Commodus, the emperor, face each other is one of the best scenes I've ever seen and that has touched me like no other scene has ever done. Gladiator can be seen as one of the best films ever made.

9 October 2005,Overrated epic,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7

2 May 2023,Epic.,"Gladiator.

A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.

I finally watched Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Ridley is definitely one the best active directors and I was curious about this movie in particular because of what I hear about it, it is phenomenal it is epic and now I can assure you that it was phenomenal and epic just like everyone keep saying.

I don't really care if it was historically accurate, not really! It respected the era and shows the great Roman Empire as we all know it, Rome was beautiful and especially the Colosseum. That what matters for me, because I really enjoyed every moment of it, the plot was interesting at first but then it turned to be different from what I thought and ended up with an epic scene that won't leave my mind for a while...

The spotlights were the directing, the scale was creepy for a movie in that time , the production design of the set and the fighting scenes were perfectly made.

Acting performances were phenomenal from each Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen.

Why am I rating it just a 8 out of 10, I guess It's just when I compare the first wonderful 40min and the epic ending with everything that happened in the middle, the slavery thing made me a little bit confused about how great this movie was, or I just was not expecting all that considering the first scenes .However, I admired it!

""Strength and honor"".",8
7 March 2002,"Finally, a movie that takes its time to tell a story","After seeing wave after wave of mindless action movies, I was actually quite surprised to for once see a movie that took its time (almost three hours) to tell an epic tale of courage, love, etc.

That story is far from perfect: the movie can be horribly slow, there are plot holes, and the entire thing borders on the sentimental, but as a whole the story is quite impressive.

The action scenes in this movie, which are not as frequent as you might expect, are quite well-done for the most part, although they are edited in a very haphazard way, making the battles very hard to follow.

Gladiator is by no means a classic, but it's a welcome change from the explosion-per-minute, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronald Emmerich (to name a few) crap, and it's a movie that has a really epic feeling to it. It make me feel great for at least a week after first seeing it.

14 April 2008,Ridley Scott puts epic back on the map,"When I was at High School everyone was going on about Gladiator and how good it was. Having seen several old movies like Spartus, I knew that these movies would require you to get into the mood for them to really enjoy them. And it seemed that all these years later and several failed attempts later I finally got around to viewing it. All I can say is that it truly was worth the hype when it came out and after all this time it still has not lost its shine as it still has the ability to entertain us. Ridley Scott set out to give us an epic and thats exactly what he had managed to do. I can't think of anybody else who could of done a job to the quality of Russell Crowe although if you pay close attention you can hear his Australian accent a bit. Joaquin Phoneix him-self was marvellous along with Oliver Reed, along with Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris , they were nothing short of mind blowing. The script was sharp and tight not to mention the costumes, make-up and various other things that made the whole experiences breath taking. The music alone is worth a purchase and it adds a certain haunt to the point where one really does want to cry. To conclude Gladiator for me is a bit like a Porshce Carrera GT , if you put the effort into watching this then I promise it is a form of pure escapism rather than entertainment. It must be on your '100 films to watch before I die' list!

3 April 2001,What we do today affects eternity!,"I have always loved movies that deal with ideals like love, hate and revenge. This movie has all three. Russell Crows does a great job playing the slave that gets revenge and frees his men. As my boyfriend said as we were watching the movie- life is fight or die. Rome its rise and fall have always fascinated me. This movie embodies both the good and bad about the Roman empire. As a whole the move held my attention. The stunts were great and the music too. I am glad that I rented it. I plan to watch it several more times.

15 May 2000,A entertaining movie that will be displaced in weeks.,"Gladiator: Having defeated the last pocket of resistance to the Roman Empire General Maximus is determined to return to his life as a farmer. Marcus Aurelius Caesar has other plans; he wants Maximus to succeed him as ruler so that Rome can once again become a republic and be returned to the people. Unfortunately, Aurelius' son Commodus learns of this and sentences Maximus to death. But, the best laid plans¬Ö

This movie seems to have triggered a round of ""Blockbusteritis""- after a spate of mediocre films, it is the first big budget movie of the summer and it is indeed entertaining. But the 62nd best movie of all time (as voted by 3500 members on the Internet Movie Database)? I think not.

The first battle scene is without a doubt my favorite part of the film - an amazing spectacle enhanced by excellent cinematography and painstakingly choreographed, it combines the best elements of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Braveheart"". I was in addition duly impressed by the special effects, particularly the recreation of the Coliseum, and the battles between the gladiators (it may be a bit too intense for some people, after all it's not often that you get to see a literal bloodbath). I did however have several problems with the story.

Maximus rides from Germania to Spain, a journey that would surely take weeks if not months and arrives literally moments too late to save his family - a little too convenient for my liking. Also, after all that time his wound is still bleeding - surely he would have become food for the buzzards long before that. Or why did Commodus not have Maximus assassinated when he returns to Rome? But my biggest question was the past between Maximus and Lucilla: without a doubt, the most pivotal relationship in the movie and it is never explained. The acting is similarly unbalanced.

Once again Russel Crowe proves his versatility as an actor: his Maximus is quiet spoken, stoic, straightforward and lives by a code of honor (a concept too few people are familiar with these days). It is impossible not to feel for him. Richard Harris, though onscreen only briefly, is excellent as the omnipotent ruler who knows his time is ending (I hope it was the makeup that made him look that bad) and is determined to do the right thing. I'm still ambivalent over Joaquin Phoenix's take on Commodus, the villain of the piece - I did not hate him for being evil, but for annoying me. I couldn't wait for someone to cleave him in two to put an end to the whining, sniveling, incestuous little weasel.

Although Gladiator does not have the staying power of Spartacus or Ben Hur, it is a good way to wile away an afternoon.",8
30 May 2000,"The Sword and Sandal Epic, Revisited","With `Gladiator', Hollywood resurrects a genre that has been neglected for decades: the Sword and Sandal Epic. These movies have been a Hollywood staple since the days of D. W. Griffith, and reached their epitome in the 1950s and 1960s with such blockbusters as `Quo Vadis', `The Robe', `Ben Hur', `Spartacus', `The Fall of the Roman Empire', and `Cleopatra'.

This incarnation of the genre affects all the arty (if not artistic) characteristics of contemporary cinema. The majority of the scenes are dimly lit and so murky that one can scarcely distinguish the actors. Even the obligatory Triumphal-Entry-Into-Rome scene appears to take place in twilight. The direction includes all the annoying characteristics common in recent movies, including innumerable quick cuts, off-center close-ups, and grainy battle scenes photographed in obvious imitation of `Saving Private Ryan'.

In addition, most of the actors habitually mumble or whisper their dialogue in the most approved Actors Studio fashion. The tendency of modern actors to swallow their lines, pioneered by Marlon Brando and James Dean, is deplorable enough in contemporary settings. In a film that purports to depict an historical period when men actually prided themselves on their rhetorical ability, unintelligible speech seems grossly out of place. Under the circumstances, the stentorian delivery of Shakespearian actors would have been far more appropriate. After all, the Romans revered Demosthenes and Cicero as much as they did Ceasar and Pompey.

Needless to say, `Gladiator' is a very bloody movie, rather more so than parents would probably wish to inflict on young viewers. I would venture to say that ""Gladiator"" has the highest body count of any film of this genre that I have seen since Cecil B. De Mille's 1934 opus, `The Sign of the Cross'. In this sense, however, quantity does not necessarily equal dramatic impact. A battle to the death between two gladiators in Stanly Kubricks `Spartacus' had impact because they were developed characters, and the audience sympathised with both of them. On the other hand, the violent deaths of a hundred people in `Gladiator' means nothing to the audience because they are all simply ciphers. In order to satisfy the modern audience's supposed appetite for pyrotechnics, a major battle is staged utilizing large quantities of Greek Fire, a weapon that would not be invented until five hundred years after the era depicted in the film. An even more glaring anomaly is the hero's horseback ride from Germany to Spain through country that looks rather more like Arizona than Europe, and his sudden and unexplained instant transposition from Spain to Africa. If he were really so weak as to be unconscious or delirious for the duration of the journey, as the audience is apparently expected to believe, than why would anyone as pragmatic as a slaver have bothered to bring him along in the first place?

`Gladiator' depicts the period of Roman History during the reign of Commodus, reputed by Roman historians to have been one of the four worst rulers the Roman Empire ever had (the others being Nero, Caligula and Septimus Severus). Commodus was all the worse for having succeeded one of the most able of the Roman Emperors, his stoical father Marcus Aurelius, whose volume of `Meditations' is still in print today. In `Gladiator', Commodus is depicted as a patricide, which was, curiously enough, one of the few crimes of which he was not guilty. In reality, Marcus Aurelius died of plague in what is now Hungary while preparing an expedition to extend the Empire to the Vistula River. Commodus, who had delusions of being the reincarnation of Hercules, actually did participate in gladiatorial games, a circumstance which scandalized his subjects. It was somewhat analogous to the President of the United States associating with punk rockers or outlaw bikers. He was eventually murdered by members of his own household, on the theory that it is better to do onto others before they do onto you.

Perhaps the most glaring anachronism in `Gladiator' is the implication that, upon the death of Commodus, the Roman Empire reverted back into a republic. Actually, there followed one of the most bizarre and grotesque episodes in the history of human government, in which the Praetorian Guard actually auctioned off the Roman Empire to the highest bidder. Obviously the producer's audience research determined that a satisfying happy ending would sell more tickets than the far more dramatic, and infinitely more cynical, real ending.",
12 May 2000,A Mixed Bag But Ultimately Worth Seeing,"The Gladiator was a disappointment to me personally. I wanted the story to be more believable and I wanted to care more for the characters. This is not to say that this effort is not worth seeing. Richard Harris and Russell Crow give excellent performances. The overall look of the period was captured well however the battle scenes, while intense, were so chopped up, one would think the editor, Pietro DiGiamimo had drank too much coffee. The quick camera work along with chopped editing actually made me dizzy. A mixed bag for me but this film should appeal to those who like epic, action thrillers. Though a bit too long, there is enough action to make it bearable.

25 July 2000,"GIVE THEM ""BREAD AND CIRCUS""","Rome, just like any other empire (British, Soviet and American, etc.), was bent as seeing itself as enlightening a dark world, even if attained by savage conquering. Therefore, historically speaking, it's hard to see these folks as the proverbial ""good guys"" in some kind of morality play.

That said, director Ridley Scott does deliver to us a pretty good movie. I found the performances adequate, yet still couldn't help see Russell Crowe's character (Maximus) as the L.A. CONFIDENTIAL detective character suited up in armor. The same brooding performance. Maximus, for a Roman General, is the typical Hollywood antihero. (Hey...let's mow these Huns down, so I can call it a day, and get home to the wife and kid.) This is hardly original. I've seen better work of his, in such films as the mentioned L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, THE SUM OF US and ROMPER STOMPER. His main antogonist, is the emperor's son, Commodus, played bewilderingly off-the-box by Joaquin Phoenix. The guy is a walking-talking Freudian slip, whom anyone with an ounce of sense wouldn't let him watch a hardware store for an afternoon, let alone an empire. The contrasts between the two leading characters was simply too obvious and simplistic. I frankly saw too much of a parallel in the script, with the relationship of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus, Commodus and Lucilla. It was like this part was lifted from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It reminded me of the old Red Skelton quip: ""Impersonation isn't the sincerest form of flattery...it's plagiarism!"" Well, not as bad as all that, but the screenplay was hardly original, as well. A nice touch, was adding a few older veteran actors (namely Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed, who gives an excellent turn to his character ""PROXIMO"").

The battle scenes and the brutal gladiator fights were stunning in their horrible brutality. Serious kudos for not flinching about the awful truths of human carnage. Top marks in this catagory. The computer generated effects have been well mentioned for their disapointing results, by other reviews, so I need not mention them here. Overall, rather overrated, but still generally entertaining fare if you're not looking for something too deep. A classic on the level of SPARTACUS? Hardly.",7
7 April 2020,From General to Gladiator,"Blood splattered, conquered ... He who has steered the horse Yu Juan has seen too much. The praise of the king and the admiration of everyone are nothing but pride that a general can enjoy. He no longer needs more honors, and when the empire is boundless, prosperous and prosperous, and no longer needs to fight around, his heroes are dimmed, and his former achievements seem to be gradually fading... At this time he was tired of killing, his thick bushes had added a little silver hair, his hands that had gripped the handle of the sword had become numb, his prestige had made the sword's majesty gradually weakened, and at this moment, he just wanted to go home. It's not that he has forgotten the blood he threw for the empire, or he wants to leave the last time to his family. Disarming and returning to the field is not the erformance of the hero MuChi, but his last wish for the empire. When he embarked on his way home and was no longer s journey, when he waved a hoe and was no longer a sharp blade, when his fugue gradually become blurred, when his wife and children who watched the distance, vaguely become clear he knew he would to go home and be reunited with his family, it was just that the responsibility on his shoulders was too heavy for him to take off his armor completely. He firmly believes that the duty is easier to clean than blood, but he discards the merits but picks up the warmth When he stroked the golden Mai Lang with that big, thick hand, when he had already completed the mission if the final republic with the responsibility To the empire, when he fell in the arena with guilt for his family.",7

And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
17 February 2002,hmmmm...,"I just wanted to say that I think it's strange that the users of this website give this movie such high votes and then give it such negative reviews. Just click to see the latest user comments and 90% of them will be negative, trust me. So why, then, did this movie get a rating 8.1 on the database and a solid position in the top 250? Personally I think it's a very good movie, it keeps you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Great performances, great action, wonderful music and production design. It was easily the most memorable movie to come out of 2000. CROUCHING TIGER, you say? Boring hokum. TRAFFIC? Well intentioned, but highly unpleasant and tedious. ALMOST FAMOUS? Unwhimsical, repetitious gobbledygook. CAST AWAY? Pretty funny on the island, extremely crappy everywhere else. GLADIATOR was the film to see, and it more than deserved the Oscars it got. I swear I turned off the Oscars when I saw that TRAFFIC WON for best director. All the guy did was shake his camera around and stage dialogue scenes. Ridley Scott is one great director and GLADIATOR is easily his best film ever. People who don't like it should ask themselves if they like movies at all, since GLADIATOR is so obviously what they are all about.",9
9 February 2001,"I don't know about anybody else, but if I'm watchi...","I don't know about anybody else, but if I'm watching a car chase or a martial arts fight or one guy hacking another guy's head off with an axe, I want to see it. Is that so hard? For some unknown reason, directors are equating style with the ability to shake the camera around so the audience can't see anything. Now this idiotic trend has grabbed Ridley Scott by the testicles. Let me give you an idea what watching this film's action sequences is like:

It's as though I wr ote the ent ire review som ethi ng lik e this.

Now, wasn't that fun? Russell Crowe plays General Maximus, who's the leader of the armies of the Roman Empire. He's just finished beating the crap out of the barbarian hordes when Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) decides he's going to make Maximus the new emperor, spurning his cleft-lip son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). This p***es Commodus off so he kills dear old dad, kills Maximus's family, and tries to kill Maximus, who barely escapes. Maximus ends up a slave, but he starts fighting, eventually becomes the best gladiator in the land and travels back to Rome so he can have his revenge on Commodus.

Aside from the action sequences, which made me feel like someone was jackhammering my head, the major problem with the film lies with Commodus, who, if he had any brains at all, would have had Maximus killed the second he saw him. Just take him in the back and bash in his head, then insist he slipped in the tub. Instead, Maximus is able to plot with Commodus's sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and one of the senators (Derek Jacobi). Of course, Commodus is clueless the entire time. Basically, by the time the film is over, you wonder how the Roman Empire managed to conquer anything.",9
31 July 2005,Gladiator rocks my socks,"For fear of somehow being misunderstood, I wanted to make something quite clear before I get started: this movie is awesome.

Yes this movie has spectacular special effects, yes this movie has amazing battle sequences, and yes this movie has a riveting soundtrack. But that's only the beginning of how incredible this movie is. The problem is that most historical epics would be happy to stop at that and be like ""oh, well at least he's wearing sandals and we have cool fight scenes."" Nuh uh not here.

Gladiator features an amazing cast. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and makes a fairly obscure historical figure very 3 dimensional: Commodus is one of the greatest baddies in recent memory. Richard Harris is outstanding as Marcus Aurelius, and everybody else does a great job as well. Last but not least, is Russell Crowe. This guy can act. And what is amazing is that he's awesome in this movie but he's even better in other movies. He's not just a one note guy. He's such a good actor that he can say scarcely anything for about 20 minutes in a movie and still get people to understand what he's doing/thinking (as there is a point in this movie which is similar).

The script is also excellent. As far as sword and sandals epics go, most are content with articulate set pieces and large scale battle scenes (huzzah!) but lack sorely in a decent screenplay soaked with character development (hissss...) Gladiator is not this way. Instead of merely trying to work around battle scenes and try to uncover a plot, it works the other way around, and the battle sequences must work around the story line. So not only is Gladiator an able action flick, but it is also an ancient political thriller.

Now that I've got that out of the way, let me go back to the battle scenes, because they are just amazing. A combined effort of superb editing, heart-pounding musical cues, and great cinematography create several amazing sequences. Especially the scenes in the Colossium. I still sit there and think ""holy crap, how did they do that?"" Any movie lover should watch Gladiator. There is a reason it won 5 academy awards. It's not just a testosterone-pumped action flick, but a quite intelligent story and does not insult your mind.",10
21 November 2006,Ridley Scott's best ever film!,"Gladiator was a truly amazing film. Aside from beating LOTR on the visual and action scales (well, in my opinion), this film really recaptures the Roman era well, and is far more than just standard sword-and-sandal fare - it has a complex story, a complex script, complex characters and complex situations. The character of Commodus was done best - his spite, cunning and villainy was brought to the screen well by actor Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe's Maximus was also a well-played and strong character, and one that you really felt for and understood - his humanity, love and sacrifice made him a true cinema hero. This is Ridley Scott's finest hour - his true talent is historical action films (Kingdom of Heaven is also one to be reckoned with). The best ever sword-and-sandal epic made! 10/10

15 May 2000,Speculator!,"Leave it to Russell Crowe, one of the few actors who actually reads a script for a movie before acting in it. He has been in two of some of the best movies of the 1990's, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER. Now Crowe proves his marquee star status with his latest film, GLADIATOR. GLADIATOR is a film in the tradition of BEN HUR, EL CID, and TEN COMMANDMENTS, a classic epic brought into the new millennium. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Spanish general fighting for the powerful Roman army. He is hailed a hero among his soldiers, and admired by his leader, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus adores Maximus so much that he would rather see Max, than his own son, Commodus (Jouquin Phoenix) become the future leader of Rome. Commodus is both hurt and angered by his father's decision, he kills his father, imprisions Maximus, as well as threatens and torments his beautiful sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Maximus escapes Commodus soldiers and discovers that his family is killed and his home is destroyed by Commodus' army. Maximus is then captured and is sold into slavery to become a gladiator, under the rule of Proximo (the late Oliver Reed). Maximus befriends another slave, Juba (Djimon Hounsou), and together along with Lucilla, and Roman senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), they try to defeat the evil rule of Commodus. From start to finish, GLADIATOR is a feast to the eyes and brain. This is the kind of film that snaggs a couple of Oscar nominations. Ridley Scott not only proves that he can make a fantastic movies that are in the future (ALIEN & BLADE RUNNER) but also the past, with this film. From start to finish, and over 150 minutes, Scott manages to makes this film entertaining. With the excellent cinematography, editing, and fight scenes, Scott makes this a unique film placed in the history of cinema. And the acting is also great. Russell Crowe is excellent, as usual, in his leading role as the faithful and honorable Maximus. Now maybe, Crowe will become a popular star that he deserved to be since QUICK & THE DEAD. And Jouquin Phoenix is very vicious and cold as the evil Commodus. He proves that he can live up to the status that his older brother was in. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris are both great as the royal family. And in his final role, Oliver Reed is great as Proximo, the former gladiator who fight his way to freedom. GLADIATOR is a film that both the young and old will enjoy. The old will enjoy it since it's in the same formula as the classic epic film is, and with the great acting. And the young will enjoy it because of it being so bloody and violent. But anyone who enjoys brain food with thier summer films will enjoy this film. Don't miss it! ***** (out of five)",8
15 September 2021,Masterclass,"I really don't want to give anything away for anyone if they haven't seen it so all I will say is Russell Crowe is brilliant (as are all the cast), the scenery is breathtaking, the soundtrack is one of the best, and emotionally it is possibly the most enthralling and affecting film I have seen. Watch on the biggest and best screen you have available so you can fully appreciate it and the sense of scale.

8 February 2009,entertaining Roman epic,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations.

28 June 2013,A milestone historical epic which has been overlooked in time,"Despite, I've been affected negatively by comments like it is overrated or it was not that great in the past, after thinking about it once more, I conclude that Gladiator is a great film. The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be clich√© for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. ""Are you not entertained?"" scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting. The climax of the film was not as climactic as I'd expected, what can I say, I found it a little bit low key, but still a ""deserving"" final. Gladiator is one of the greatest historical epics so far.",10
6 May 2003,spectacular film,"I had seen this film four times because I was so excited about it, but never got around to reviewing it. This is the story of Maximus, played by Russel Crowe, who won that year's Academy Award. Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, the wicked Commodus, played by Joaguin Phoenix, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge. 9/10

31 January 2015,A very solid movie all-round,"What is cool about Gladiator (besides a whole lot of things) is that it should not offend pro- or anti-Romans. There have been a number of big movies, almost since the beginning of movies, that put Rome into the evil category. This choice echoes from the popular anti-Imperial culture of the 20th and 21st century that favors freedom over unity and order. Sorry, I will stop if that sounds preachy, but the point is: Gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals.

Gladiator is not the most historically accurate film. After all, they put a whole lot of story conveniently into the events for which there are very few sources for reference. And of course the armor is not going to be perfectly accurate, and of course everything is pumped up. But it actually does a great deal right and looks genuine. The politics get smart toward the middle of the film. This film has depth, though it is not hard to understand.

Disguised under all the pomp and depth there is hidden a fairly typical formula for an action movie with a good and a bad guy, a family member in danger, a personal loss, a cheesy honor speech, and of course a mano-a-mano fight, but it is hidden and packaged very well.

Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus is not the protagonist but is arguably the main character of the film. The ""evil"" in his character is so refined, deep, believable and even relatable. The cowardice is palpable. He feels like a complex character that creates a good contrast to Russel Crowe's Gladiator, the simpleton soldier with his honor, love and anger issues. Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner was also really good and expressive.

The camera work is excellent. The busy sets are filled with good lighting and shots are properly populated, with good atmosphere from all the various fires, mist and snow. Computer generated effects are unfortunately used quite a bit, as the makers would have had a hard time showing the Roman scale without it and yes, some of these effects look dated, but those shots are not shown for long and overall it works.

The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is actually not the best if you listen to it on its own but works really well in this movie, especially in battles. It brings the necessary gravity to everything. Speaking of listening to the soundtrack on its own, do try ""The Might of Rome"" when visiting a large city - awesome. Lisa Gerrard brought her voice which is a great recognizable emotional deep contralto, though her main presence in this movie is saved for the credits.

The movie is totally rewatchable, and in fact, the second time may reveal many new nuances in the dialogue you may have missed the first time, especially if you are watching the extended addition (which you should).

As time passed after its release, this movie was increasingly becoming a hype. Internet memes were being made from it. People kept asking me to make Maximus' armor for a game. This plebeian hype made me increasingly dislike this film by extension, but the fact is that this is a very well-made enjoyable movie.",9
20 June 2009,An epic worthy of Best Picture,"To my surprise, I've read several negative comments on this film, referring to it both as ""fluff"" and a ""Braveheart-wanna-be."" I found ""Gladiator"" to be a well-made, engaging epic and character study of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general who becomes a fugitive and comes back to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge on the ones who killed his family. Maximus is a great character that many people can probably somehow relate to. This is Russell Crowe's best film by a long shot. In the same way that ""Braveheart"" taught us that ""Every man dies, not every man really lives,"" this film teaches us that ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" an equally compelling message that resonates both during and long after the movie is over. The film's unique way of depicting the afterlife (which I won't give away here) is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, and the flashbacks between eternity and the battle scenes toward the end are due to Ridley Scott's superb job of directing this film. It's not completely flawless as ""Braveheart"" was, since I could have done without a particular murder sequence and a few of the battle scenes which are a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, I give this film a high recommendation. ""Gladiator"" will entertain and engage you, giving you a lot to think about when living your life.

***1/2 out of ****",9
26 February 2004,A Bad Reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire,"I happen to love films about the ancient world. This one isnt about Ancient Rome. Its about costumes from a road company production of AIDA and sets using Biedermier furniture instead of researching the period. Its about blurry filters over the lenses. Its about a pathetically boring music score and the use of huge suffocating close ups for emotional intensity. Its about blurry computer generated reconstructions and a cloddish leading performance. The Release Print that I saw was bluish and soft focus. After seeing films like BEN HUR in Ultra Panavision 70 and six channel sound in the sixties, you have no idea how outrageously disappointed I was with this overrated ""Ridley Scott"" garbage.

14 May 2005,My favourite movie,"This is the best film I've ever seen. It's the only film I'm giving a 10/10 at the ranking. This movie has it all. Excellent historical locations, a superb story, great acting and really exciting action scenes. The Gladiator is a story about men, revenge, honor and bravery. And it's perfect in every way. You couldn't find a more masculine character than Maximus, and this character fits the great story perfectly. Good job, Russel Crowe. It was also interesting to see Ralph Moeller as one of the gladiators. The first battle in Germania is especially awesome. I guess it's one of the most well made battles in movie history. The only slightly negative comment I have about this film, is that the ending is a clich√© and too much of a Hollywood ending. But that's easily forgotten in this true masterpiece. By the way, the music is VERY good.

11 March 2004,Russell rules,"""Gladiator"" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled.

Also, ""Gladiator"" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome.

""Gladiator"" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; ""The Patriot"" and ""Braveheart"" were very similar to ""Gladiator"" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood.

""Gladiator"" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know ""Gladiator"" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. ""Gladiator"" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.",
13 February 2005,A Guy's Night Out,"This is the guy's movie. No way around it. There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas. For shame, no togas!!! It's a great man's movie which have some small faults to it, but still good nonetheless.",7
5 September 2009,Terrific Historical Epic!,"This movie ranks up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire (the same story as Gladiator minus the Gladiator and with the second best chariot race on film), Quo Vadis, The Robe and others. The cast is superb from Oscar winner Russell Crowe to Joaquin Phoenix, the late, great Richard Harris, Oliver Reed (in his last role), David Hemming, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Honsou and the rest. Ridley Scott keeps it moving at break-neck pace and has created a masterpiece. I won't go into the plot, but I will say it is nail biting tense, stunningly beautiful, very moving and even heartbreaking. If there's not enough action in this one for you, well then, you'll never be satisfied. I should mention the awesomely magnificent music score by the great Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. If you enjoy a great Epic film, then this is for you.

4 April 2005,The Ben-Hur of Our Generation,"Simply put it is the achievement of a lifetime for Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. Crowe finally solidified his place in the acting community with this flawless performance and hasn't let up since. I will never forget the look on his face when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor he looked like he had been told he just won the lottery as I am quite sure he was thinking he was gonna get rear ended yet again. From start to finish you are awestruck with how great this masterpiece is. Ancient Rome never looked so good and the beauty and intense savagery is captured like water in a bottle. It also puts every movie that came out that year to absolute shame without doubt or question. It stands toe to toe with the best epic movies of all time, including Braveheart, Spartacus, and of course Ben-Hur which was by mine and many other accounts the best epic movie ever made. They put together the best cast Hollywood could assemble and knocked out audiences all over the world. Phoenix puts on a great show and certainly deserved the acclaim given him for it I was disappointed he didn't win an Oscar but very glad he was nominated. Gladiator was the Academy's Best Picture and is the best movie of 2000.",10
21 May 2000,"""He will give them death and they will love him for it.""","I did not know movies like this were made anymore -- or even could be made.

The production values go beyond lavish -- this is truly a Hollywood Spectacular.

Somebody really did their homework -- every detail was brilliantly executed. However the Romans of that period in history did not have tempered steel (which made its debut in the 14th Century) but is sure looked better on screen than the iron or bronze weapons the real gladiators would have carried.

There is true genius in this film: costuming, photography, art direction and most of all the acting and direction.

Ridley Scott outdid himself. The sheer size, scope and grandeur are breathtaking.

Russell Crowe heads an incredible international cast that had to truly believe in this film to achieve the greatness that the audience sees on the screen.

Whoever did the matte paintings (no credit given) be they on the traditional glass or CGI deserves a special mention. They transport the viewer to a place that is so unreal it becomes real.

In the credits there is a brief homage to Oliver Reed -- who died the day after the film was released in the United States... I do not know how they worked that credit into the release that I saw but I do appreciate it.

This is an instant classic and will go down in filmatic history as 'A Movie For All Time.'",9

17 October 2007,Extremely entertaining.,"Bringing back the epic genre, Gladiator makes the classics Ben-Hur and Spartacus proud by recreating the wonder, grit and feel of being in Ancient Rome. An exceptional effort was done by all involved. The costumes, the cinematography, the choreography, even the music itself, Gladiator is deserving in all of its awards and nominations received. Let us not forget the actors themselves. Truly, Gladiator is one film that will stand the test of time for many years to come.

General Maximus helps Marcus Aurelius keep Germania under check, but who will do the same for Rome in the case of the Caesar's death? Marcus doesn't think his son, Commodus will do any good in charge. ""No morals,"" the Caesar claims, but Commodus thinks of himself as merciful, by killing his father, Maximus' family and intimidating the Senate. Maximus survives his own assassination attempt and swears to right wrong and get revenge.

Some of the best action sequences are seen in Gladiator. A couple of those are the first fights in the Colosseum. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job himself playing the villain Commodus. The scenes with him and Lucius are some of the more terrifying I've seen, particularly since Ridley Scott does a good job portraying their bond from Lucilla's perspective. Proximo stated to Maximus that he had to win the crowd, and surely by doing that, he won movie-goers as well, as this will remain one of Russell Crowe's finest performances. Epic, blockbuster and critically acclaimed, Gladiator had earned its Academy Award for Best Picture, and then some.",8
14 February 2010,not that impressive *spoilers*,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6
24 February 2001,"Criminally Overrated; a Roman ""Death Wish""","As I write this, I see upon my shelf of movies a true classic everyone should know; ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It was the best Indiana Jones flick; escapism refined to its purest, most unadulterated form. I wish I had been old enough when it was released in 1983 to call it a stirring epic and one of the best movies of all time.

Was it those things? Certainly not. You know what you want to see in ""Raiders,"" and that's Harrison Ford escape from impossible situations, stirring action sequences, and Nazis getting their just desserts. I know what I was looking for when I went to see ""Gladiator,"" and that was testosterone-oozing killing machines lopping off arms and limbs in a plot not too intellectually stimulating where the the bad guy died and our hero won out. I saw that, and I give the movie a 6-7 as a result; professionally-done, cliche`d, brainless action and nothing more. It, too, was cheap (100 million dollar-cheap) escapism, so why is it the forerunner for Best Picture?

The Academy was duped when they saw this. There's nothing Best Picture-worthy about this film. Performances? No. Direction? No. Script? A thousand times no!

Russell Crowe for Best Actor? To his credit, he's suave and probably tough enough to grind Kirk Douglas from ""Spartacus"" into chum. He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from someone who maintains the EXACT SAME facial expression and emotional state throughout 9/10 of the movie's running time. The real talent here was with Joaquin Phoenix, who transformed a character written as a whining infantile nuisance that wouldn't scare a goldfish into a truly creepy and threatening presense. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but not for this. He gave an even better performance in ""Quills.""

Speaking of Philip Kaufman's masterpiece, ""Quills"" is one movie on a list I would have rather seen nominated for Best Picture of 2000 than ""Diehard with Sandals."" ""Almost Famous,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""High Fidelity"" and ""You Can Count on Me"" are only a few of the well-crafted pieces of cinematic glory we received in 2000 that were overlooked by the members of the Academy that would rather get soaked in au jus and thrown into a tiger's cage than ::gasp!:: NOMINATE A MOVIE THAT MADE LESS THAN 50 MILLION DOLLARS (Miramax films excluded)!!! I guess the actors in the preceding films should've used a monotone voice and screamed a few more times.

What really irks me, though, is the nerve of the Academy nominating ""Gladiator's"" overcooked, cliche`s-on-parade laden script. Holy Mother of Christ, movies like this aren't driven by a script. They're driven by studio executives throwing fistfulls of money to make something that will make you go ""oooh"" and ""aaaah.""

Movies are an art form, and with that, ""Gladiator"" is the equivalent of the sketch artist at the mall doing portraits for ten dollars each. The Picasso of the nominees is the challenging, explosive ""Traffic,"" and the awe-inspiring ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (a movie with a hint of human connection and feeling; Ridley Scott, take note) is Salvador Dali. I plea to any Academy Member that might by chance be reading this: please, I beg of you, leave this along with the mediocre ""Erin Brockovich"" and the preach-fest ""Chocolat"" at the bottom of the heap, and let a movie made by people who know and care take home the gold.",6
10 May 2000,7 on a scale of 10,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part. I went with 4 others. Three of them, like me rated it as a B- or about a 7. One of them liked it considerably more. But, based only on a popularity contest, a 7 is low as per this site. I had several problems with the movie.

1) It was WAY too long as so many movies are nowadays. It ran about 2:30. It wasn't that it was boring, it is just that it could EASILY have been 1/2 hour shorter and it would have been better. It bordered on dragging almost throughout. There were a few exciting scenes, but even they were too long. Minus 1 point.

2) The fights were less than spectacular. I was very impressed with the sets, dress and scale. It was truly an epic in that sense. However, the fights were weak. Compared to Zorro and Matrix, the fight scenes in this movie were low tech. Minus 1 point.

3) I'm not a particular fan of sword movies to begin with. I prefer modern movies as opposed to period pieces. It has been my experience that women like these types of movies better then men. I'm a man. You do the math. Minus 1 point.",7
4 March 2010,Gladiators... I salute you.,"Gladiator!!!Inspiring & true to its word action & gory filled.Top notch performance from Russell Crowe.His dialog delivery & facial expressions were just too good.Joaquin Pheonix plays a pretty classy role as Commodus.He was just too good.This movie deserved an Oscar rightfully.Ridlet Scott is a master at story telling & he has prove this in gladiator.The little performances by Djimon Hounsou(Juba) & Oliver Reed(Proximo) are applaudable.The casting is perfectly appropriate.Movie quotes in this movie at its par.You wont forget them for a long time to come.some memorable quotes always follow me wherever i go: Juba-""I will see you again... but not yet... not yet..."" & who can forgot Proximo-"" And when you die - and die you shall - your transition will be to the sound of...

30 October 2019,My favourite film ever amongst true greats,"I have given this and Dunkirk 10/10, both films without fail make me cry like a baby and I have a heart of stone. It is very hard to justify 10/10 but for their sheer consistency in manipulating my emotions I cannot fault either film. They are both the epitome of filming excellence and should be observed as such.

Gladiator has been my favourite film almost since it came out, I say almost as like any true work of art, I didn't necessarily absorb it's full clout on first viewing, which to me is not only okay, it's a testament to great film (on first viewing I didn't get American Psycho at all, 2nd viewing I saw it's excellence).

I do believe you should not give 10/10 reviews but there has to be exceptions when it is truly deserved and this is one of those few times. I have an ability to pick holes in almost any film I watch, I have to say almost as in this, I can not. If I HAD to pick a hole, almost 20 years later it would be the cgi, which is pretty much flawless.

I don't review with spoilers or hints at plot, I prescribe to advising why this is a necessary part of your film education. Put simply, with this film, if you have not seen it and/or have no opinion of it, you're opinion means nothing to me. It's that simple.",10
10 May 2005,A very accomplished film,"Gladiator is one of the best films of this decade. Crowe is on top form as the lead, Oliver Reed putting in a handy turn as his mentor. The battle scenes are epic, especially those between Barbarian Germans and Roman troops at the start. The warrior fights are also very well done, plenty of blood being spilt. The storyline is interesting and not too cheesy, unlike so many other Hollywood movies today. The only blot on this film's copybook is Richard Harris who's monologues are just a tad dull. Phoenix is not bad as the villain however. The musical score works nicely too. Gladiator is well worth seeing and for a 15 rating contains plenty of action.

4 November 2007,Gladiator - a very pleasant surprise,"I walked into the cinema not knowing how this movie was going to turn out. Right from the word go I was gripped till the end. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen. Until this movie I had never seen an historical epic and this movie got me hooked on them. At almost 3 hours it may seem long but you will engrossed in the movie that time will fly by.

Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix was superb. This movie is famous for having Oliver Reed's last performance, he died during the filming and some of his scenes are computer generated. Ridley Scott as the director is extremely good. One of the best movies of 2000.

9 February 2001,Mindless and Predictable.,"Gladiator is filled with so many tired old cliches that I can only sum it up with a tired old reviewer clich√©. Leave you brain at the door.

This movie starts off with a large battle scene where Roman army Sargent, Russell Crowe, displays a unique ability to fight with courage and honor. Yeah! Unfortunately for him he is more concern with getting home to his family where he can raise his children and grow his crops. The only thing that is keeping him in the army is a strong devotion to his Caesar.

After winning the opening scene (Believe me, I am not spoiling anything imdb.) Crowe's Caesar comes down from the mountain where he has overlooked the battle to congratulate him. As soon as I saw the old and feeble Caesar get off his horse I literally counted the seconds before the Caesar's `jealous of Crowe' younger brother or son came walking onto the scene. 28 seconds later the Caesar's son who it conveniently late for the battle, enters the scene. Things really heat up when the Caesar names Crowe as his successor instead of his son. What follows is one movie clich√© after another until a final battle scene between Crowe and Caesar Jr.

I have enjoyed movies that followed this kind of formula in the past. Spartacus and Braveheart are my two favorite examples. But what those movies have that Gladiator lacks is simple. Character. Ridley Scott's direction should have been more focus on giving his lead roles a third dimension instead of dragging out action. The bland story and flatness of the characters made me wish that everyone would die so I could arrive home sooner.

Although Gladiator did have well choreographed fight scenes and some good computer generated special effects; as most movies today, they left the script as a last priority which this reviewer still believes should be the whole point of movie making.",1
27 March 2015,A Colossal Performance by Crowe makes this an Epic Thrill-Packer!,"You will swoon with woozy delight over Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic 'Gladiator' - a sweaty, stylish hunk-fest that takes you back to the Roman era. It is so insanely enjoyable and carried off with such dash and chutzpah, that it makes you wonder where this genre has been all your life.

Worried about the judgment of history as he ends his days with Rome in a swirl of political instability, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) charges his favorite general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), over his petulant son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to whip Rome back into shape and return power to the people. Maximus wants no part of the offer and yearns to return to his family. But before this wish can become reality, Commodus intervenes, triggering a series of events that changes the future of the Roman Empire. An attack on Maximus and his family relegates the once-great hero to a shattered, anonymous slave. Purchased by a crafty spectacle promoter, he's trained as a gladiator. The man who once fought for his nation and its ideals now fights to provide thrills to a bloodthirsty mob, constantly enduring Commodus' envy and the ignominy of being a slave. But it is as a slave- gladiator that Maximus finds the way to serve Rome once again, and help deliver on his promise to the late Emperor.

Gladiator is film-making at its finest (Ridley Scott in top form), painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail. Right from its opening frames of hand-to- hand butchery, Gladiator simply grabs you by the balls and never lets go. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and you'll find rich historical themes, and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement. The depiction of the random savagery amid which the issue has to be confronted is astonishing lending the action sequences an elegiac quality. The atmospherics are so robust that you can almost smell the sweat pouring from the Colosseum as Maximus battles both man and beast for the amusement of the masses. The mob's cheers make a chilling counterpoint to our close-up views of carnage.

True, Gladiator is full of arresting splendor and technical virtuosity. But the camera only has eyes for Maximus as Crowe puts a stranglehold on stardom with his performance. The man exudes a physicality comparable to the beasts he has to combat in the arena and holds the screen with such conviction and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him.

Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome: a sprawling, enthralling orgy of blood, passion, betrayal and revenge. A gloriously entertaining thrill-packer of truly epic proportions!",9
18 August 2000,Great movie,"This movie was just one of the best. This a Stanley Kubrick like film (well from my point of view). It has great acting, superb special effects, and plot that is just excellent. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

19 February 2001,Are you not entertained?,"From the opening moments of Gladiator, and till the last, it is clear that you are being treated to Oscar¬Æ quality entertainment. Ridley Scott, who directed one of my all-time favorites, Blade Runner, almost never misses. But few directors can ever hope to hit the mark so cleanly and convincingly as Scott does with Gladiator. Gladiator is magnificent, thrilling, moving, epic, heroic and a dozen other things so conspicuously absent in so many movies and so abundantly present here.

Russell Crowe was born to play this role, and he occupies the character with epic vigor and a presence that has a tendency to overpower a scene. It is, of course, true that Crowe's ego made him nearly impossible to work with, and he is said to have proclaimed during filming that he was the greatest actor in the world. There are, in fact, moments in the film where it would be difficult to argue with him. Still, he has subtle moments as well. There is a scene, late in the movie. Maximus is near the end of an epic struggle and all the contentious forces of Rome are whirling around him. He is asked by Lucilla, the emperor's sister, with whom he apparently had an affair years ago, if all that had happened made her seem different. Crowe replies, with stunning understatement, ""You laughed more."" I knew in that moment that Crowe had won the Oscar¬Æ, and deservedly so.

The story is, quite simply, largely fabrication, though to some extent based on fact. It is true that Commodus was the only Roman emperor to fight in the Coliseum, although his battle with Maximus, as well as its magnificent conclusion, is entirely fictionalized. In fact, Maximus Decimus Meridius is a completely fictitious character perhaps composited by screenwriter David Franzoni and director Ridley Scott, who clearly gave themselves full literary license to rewrite the relatively common story of Commodus into something breathtakingly memorable.

Hollywood has been in the movie business a long time. There are many great movies, but few are great on the scale of Gladiator. Every aspect of Gladiator comes together so spectacularly that any shortcomings it may have are easily overlooked. Scott's inspired direction, Hans Zimmer's thrilling score, supplemented by Lisa Gerrard's stirring vocals; all conspire magically to contribute to Gladiator's success. John Mathieson's cinematography, which Scott relied on in Robin Hood and Hannibal as well, is painterly and dark, perfectly matched to the story and characters. There are movies of the genre, towering achievements in cinema from decades past, held in higher regard than Gladiator, but in many ways even they are not Gladiator's equal. Gladiator is not only a peer to the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur, but, ultimately, their superior. And for the curious, or the skeptical, I would put the Battle of Carthage scene up against the Chariot Race scene any day. Perhaps it isn't as disturbingly, agonizingly long, but the heroism and courage played out in the Carthage scene is without equal.

A few of the common problems with epic films are necessarily present. Some of the characters are not fully developed, which, given the story arc, is common in epic films which are based on events rather than subtle characterizations. As for historical inaccuracies, much cited in derision of the film, I don't think Scott is presently seeking an endowed chair in History at any major university, so if he took a few liberties with a well-known story to heighten the drama, I can only reply with a quote from the main character; ""Are you not entertained?""

The lore surrounding Gladiator is definitely fascinating. Oliver Reed, who died during principle filming, had to be recreated digitally in some scenes. Despite the difficulty of this effort, it was less expensive than refilming Reed's scenes and many of the cast insisted that Reed remain a part of the film. Richard Harris is rumored to have refused to learn rewrites, complicating his scenes early in the film. In both cases, their immense contributions to the film make it all worthwhile.

Scott's signature touches, a washed-out color palette, the ubiquitous slow motion splattering of blood, and, most notably his tendency to magnify characters by using tight close-ups against backgrounds compressed by the application of telephoto lenses, may have been a bit overdone, but the combined effect heightens the action, the drama and the characters and somehow imbues them with a sense of history fitting the story.

In short, Gladiator may be the best sandals and swords epic ever, and a worthy heir to the mantle handed down from its predecessors. Russell Crowe is glorious as the brooding and relentless gladiator bent on revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is electric as the devious and ambitious Commodus, and without a doubt should have received the Best Supporting Actor nod. With Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, sadly both now deceased, added for flavor, this is as great an epic as any.

So many reviewers want to dislike movies that are popular, as if it proves that they are gifted with an appreciation of fine cinema that escapes lesser moviegoers. I say nonsense. The reason everyone thinks this movie is great is because it is great. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's just plain fun. Grab some popcorn and prepare to be entertained.",10

Everything from the score by Hans Zimmer to Ridley Scott's nuanced direction is near-short of perfection. It's a film with all the right elements: a menacing and unpredictable adversary played by the brilliant Joaquin Phoenix; Russell Crowd's more virtuous performance as Maximus and a narrative full of intrigue and gory f violent gladiator scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat! If you haven't seen this film by now, it's a must see, so please do get in on the action!

16 May 2000,Not as good as Braveheart but...,"I liked this movie, it was pretty awesome but its not as good as Braveheart but real close. Gladiator is much better than 13th Warrior though. Well, the opening battle sequnce was good even though it was hard 2 see sometimes cause of the shaky camera movement but after the sequence it got better & didnt become shaky. The battle scenes were very good & man was it loud. Well, this is worth seeing & having on tape if u r into those ""Spartacus"" movies.

20 August 2021,Disappointing blockbuster,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",2

12 May 2000,A Beautifully Realized Film,"We had grown used to Ridley Scott missing in action when it came to story concept, plotline and story elements. He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless. He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.

In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix. Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can delight in the hearing of an old song once more, finely rendered.

Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film. It has all the elements, atmospheric musical score and a fine lead player with a solid supporting cast. It did not get an overall excelent vote from me due to the current in-style dark lensing and film processing, apparently to look realistic or just to copy an awful dark style we first noticed on television, copied now by nearly everyone and as such will immediately lock the film into a quickly dated style as in the overuse of zoom lenses in the early 70s and similarly, with the Steadicam a few years later. Heavy style like this serves only to date a film and cut its legs. This brooding, dark style would have worked fine in the north country scenes, the Germanium campaign, but when it continues into sunny Rome and then, worst of all, becomes even darker in the depiction of the Astral Plane in the final scenes, we had to wince. The Astral Plane, for those who have been fotunate enough to visit it during meditation, if anything, is gloriously luminescent.

Here, we also bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three his scenes left undone. The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.

This is one I will be purchasing in wide screen DVD when it comes out. Thanks to an extraordinary filmmaker and company, it is a keeper.",9
14 October 2020,Classic Ridley Scott = Great film + Historical catastrophe,"Every second of Crowe, Phoenix, and Harris is really amazing. The underlying theme of the film in my view is the topic of Stoicism, something that Scott seems to love exploring also in the very underrated Kingdom of Heaven (Director's cut) and Robin Hood. The cinematography is fantastic, and the story captivating.

However, another mark of Scott is complete and utter historical inaccuracy. The way Rome is displayed, its grandeur, etc. All of it is very incorrect. Even the name of the main character is impossible. But, personally I never go to Scott for a documentary. I go to him for his ability to create an ethical argument to wrestle with in the film, and for gorgeous cinematography.

If you like what I like, then you'll love Scott.

26 December 2019,A world reinvented - bigger than life on screen.,"I was totally impressed by the craftmenship in this film. The sunlit city, reinvented with CGI and tons of real life sets, the extras, the props, the costumes and just the sheer amount of detail in the pictures struck me. It delivers the power and greatness of the Roman Empire and the power struggle of the characters in it.

For me, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix was even more powerful and detailed than Crowe's, but that is up to taste, I guess.

The music and Ridley Scotts skill to bring large entities (such as an old empire) with images back to life is one of the greatest trades shown in this film for me. Like blade runner... a masterpiece, showing a different society, politics but still relatable human struggles in a struggling world. Well done!

25 July 2003,Epic Tripe Gets The Thumbs Down!,"To my mind this film is totally overrated. Why did Russel Crowe win best actor Oscar? He can drool but he can't cry!! And as for the Oscar winning sub-Enya and intrusive soundtrack??? The dialogue is laughable. Derek (Theatre Luvvy) Jacobi's vain attempt to imbue cornball dialogue with the gravity of Shakespeare is laughable. There must be every accent in the book on display here. Who's ever heard of an Australian Gladiator?! Authentic??? I think not!

I expected better from a movie that won best Oscar. Moulin Rouge was robbed. Baz was robbed. Thumbs down!

Does it have stunning visuals? Yes. Is the cast okay? Yes. Does one care? NOPE. The film commits the cardinal sin of action epics ... it's B-O-R-I-N-G. My suggestion? Save a couple of bucks and rent the Cuba Gooding, Jr. version instead.

24 August 2000,Big disappointment,"My nephew, Matt (10 yrs old), summed up the picture very well when he said as we were leaving - ""That Roman Emperor was REALLY whiney"". There is a problem inherent to all gladiator movies - people come to see them for the fight sequences and not the plot. Not even Stanley Kubrick could surmount that problem (which, in reality, is a studio problem i.e. the grafting of studio morality, storytelling and themes onto a foreign stock). Thus we have a VERY long movie, full of fight sequences, and when there is no fighting there are certainly people trying to tell us about IMPORTANT themes that appear nowhere else in the story. Then there is that studio morality thing. Rome is not America. Neither is the conflict between Imperialists and Republicans one of freedom (both sides wanted slavery). And, in the end, what is the story about. Nothing but a pathetic and rather far-fetched Hollywood revenge fantasy.

I am a fan of director Ridley Scott. He does some wonderful things with candlelit scenes. The action scenes are fun (although the slo-mo/strobing gets tedious over the length of this piece). Also a delight (not to mention an in-joke) having Derek Jacobi. In toto, however, the film is a big disappointment.",1
6 April 2001,"Sorry Russell, Mel beat ya to it!","Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are

*uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well.

And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears...

Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout.

Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!! It's slow, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, it's an action film, it's a melodrama, it's an action film...Make up your bleeding mind!! Pacing was horrid! And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long...

Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice? Save yourself two and a half hours and go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead...or Braveheart...each has everything this doesn't. 6/10.",6
11 June 2022,Glorious,"Although i'm not a huge fan of movies that take place in the ancient era, Gladiator is a exception. It's a wonderfully made action packed and emotional movie by Ridley Scott. Russel Crowe really pulled his absolute best in this movie, no wonder he won a oscar. The uniqueness of the story is also what really makes it stand out from many other movies that try to even mimic a fraction of how beautiful this movie. Absolutely a must watch.

3 April 2001,Crowe followed the Oscar/Hollywood formula,"People are constantly talking about how Gladiator deserved to win, *considering* ""the slew of movies that came out last year"". To this, I must argue. If you're going to talk about Gladiator in its own right, then I guess it's a good film, if all the other films'celluloid and tapes and DVD's were burned and Gladiator was the only film anybody could ever watch ever again. But I can instantly say it is not the Best Pic of 2000 when compared to the other films that came out.

Unlike many people who say Phoenix overacted his part, I have to say he's the only good part about this movie. I heard that Ridley Scott had Russell Crowe in mind for Maximus the whole time when he first chose the project. I don't understand this, so then I must not understand what everyone saw with his performance. I thought he sucked major d***. Just because you didn't win for The Insider and people feel bad for their mistake, it doesn't mean you're a shoe-in for next year's big-budget epic-tale-lead-actor award! In reality, this is the process of how to win an Academy Award. Just start off your American movie-career by being in a real underdog, socially-moral movie that does only OK at the BO while praised by critics (The Insider), where yu have to gain about 35 pounds, add wrinkles and grey hair, basically look bad just so you can bring out your artistic side. Then lose at the Academy awards. This is the first step of playing at their game. The next year, after you've finally given in to the plotless stupid-script, hugely-advertized flick, the Academy gives you the award in a way of saying, ""Good boy!"" No matter if you acted like total crap, you've played by the Hollywood game of having people award you out of pity for your last film. Let's see when Russell Crowe will ever win another Oscar.

Unlike most people, I thought Joaquin Phoenix was the best part of this movie. I don't think he overacted (as we've all learned in history, how are you supposed to act the role of a deranged Roman emperor? Those guys were f** crazy) He was awesome, and I would watch Gladiator again only to see his acting.

Traffic was much better than <Gladiator>, but Wo hu zang long should've won for Best Picture. Anybody who has seen both films cannot tell me they'd be more entertained by watching Gladiator again than Crouching Tiger.",
6 June 2001,Appollonio and Gotto,"A lot of strange comments on this film:

No plot - did you actually watch this move?

Not history - yes we know that - it's a s-t-o-r-e-y - just like Tom Clancey writes stories we like to see turned into movies

Russell Crowe isn't any good - no one in Hollywood could have done it - period

Joaquin Phoenix isn't good - any one else would have been laughable - his portrayal of madness, twisted love and power is extraordinary

Boring - it just happened a long time ago - guess you dropped Ancient History in school too

Glitches - of course it has - everyone has had problems with these types of films including Spartacus and Ben Hur

The one thing that is really different about this movie is that you feel connected with Crowe and Phoenix - I never connected with Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston

Maximus - the classic warrior - his look, his command, his devotion - I didn't get that emotion from Gibbon's Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire - Maximus became real

Commodus fascinates with his mad driven emotions "" we both loved my father that makes us brothers"" - wonderful madness - we love to watch and hate him

An incredible insight into Rome - the powerful foreign general - the twisted murdering heir - triumphant armies - the tottering republic - conspiring senators - royal family love and hate - punishment and revenge - slaves and gladiators - swearing allegiance or death - magnificent achievements of the ancient world - blood and death for sport - long military campaigns and the wish for home

This film reveals to us why men from all over the known world fought and died for the Roman Empire - even though they may have never been to Rome - Maximus tells this to Marcus Aurelius - the world is dark but Rome is the light - all my studies and reading never helped me understand that - it's the same reason in WWII why someone from a Kansas farm would join the Army and fight in Germany even they had never been to Washington

The downside:

Russell Crowe may never find such a perfect part again

Juaquin Phoenix may never find such a perfect part again

Riddley Scott may never find such a great story to tell again

Hans Zimmer may never find such a tough movie to so brilliantly score

The upside:

Maximus Decimus Meridius will always exist in our minds

Commodus will always exit in our minds Ancient Rome will always exist in our minds We will always see the grain awaiting harvest when we hear that haunting sound

But I will always think of Appollonio and Gotto and wish they were my horses too",10
27 March 2023,Are You Not Entertained?!,"Alright, movie-lovers, buckle up for this one! As a die-hard movie buff, I simply cannot get enough of the 2000 masterpiece ""Gladiator."" Directed by the iconic Ridley Scott and starring the man, the myth, the legend himself, Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius - need I say more?

From the moment the film starts, you are sucked into the world of ancient Rome, with a visually stunning opening battle scene that would make any history nerd drool. Scott's attention to detail in the set and costume design is chef's kiss - it's like a time machine back to the Colosseum.

Now, let's talk about Crowe's performance. This guy delivers such a raw, emotional, and powerful portrayal of a betrayed general turned gladiator that you can't help but root for him every step of the way. And let's not forget Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus - what a villain! The guy can make your skin crawl with just one sinister look, and his performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy.

The musical score by Hans Zimmer is just the cherry on top of this epic sundae. It swells and soars, making every scene feel more intense and heart-wrenching. I'm not gonna lie, I still get goosebumps every time I hear ""Now We Are Free.""

If I had to nitpick, there are some historical inaccuracies and a few moments that can feel a tad melodramatic. But hey, it's Hollywood, baby! What's a blockbuster without a little creative liberty?

In conclusion, ""Gladiator"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves action, drama, and a good ol' tale of vengeance and redemption. So, grab some popcorn, dim the lights, and let Russell Crowe take you on a journey to ancient Rome. And remember: ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity.""",10
13 May 2000,A historical epic of such proportions unseen since Spielberg's 'Amistad',"Gladiator is an extremely well done, though flawed, epic that is very deserving of it's box office success. Ridley Scott's best film since Alien is a terrific blend of action, drama, and worldwide appeal that is sure to make Russell Crowe a star.

Much of the film is wonderfully entertaining, one of the best films yet this year, but somehow I don't think it lived up to the praise it's getting from critics and audiences alike. Nearly every scene in 'Gladiator' is overly stylized, with Scott going way too far overboard with the camera effects, fast cuts, camera movement, and over baked atmospheres. Still, in the era of technology this is becoming more and more common, especially in films made by Dreamworks. Because of this the film is strangely devoid of any sort of emotion, even with the deaths being one of the main aspects of the story.

The other problem I had with 'Gladiator' was the opening scene, which had Maximus (Crowe) and his army fighting a group that opposed the Roman rule. The scene (though it set a good pace for the rest to follow) had absolutely nothing to do with the central story, and was never explained or even referred to later on.

Still, it commands first rate performances from Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (Return to Paradise), and Scott handles it quite well. The music by Hans Zimmer is also outstanding, though it ends up sounding a lot like his score for the recent 'The Thin Red Line'. The movie should not be missed, and the giant budget allows it to rise above the mediocrity that plagued several recent epics attempting to emulate 'Titanic'. Dreamworks deserves a hit, and they're getting one here.

4 April 2020,"Although we cannot choose fate, we can choose how to face death.","Although we cannot choose fate, we can choose how to face death. I saw a slave stronger than the Roman Emperor today. You wrote me four primary virtues. Wisdom, justice, perseverance and temperance. When I saw it, I knew I did not possess these virtues. But I have other virtues, father. That's what makes me overcome others' ambitions, resourcefulness and courage.

11 June 2023,Blood And Sand,"In the 1950s, Hollywood insiders began to realize that television was a threat to their main source of income. As the audiences were declining at the cinemas, something drastic had to be done. So, the studios launched a number of big-budget, historical epics. Films like ""Quo Vadis"", ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" would hopefully attract moviegoers back to the theaters. The sword-and-sandal genre was born.

In 1963, however, ""Cleopatra"" put a damper on things. The movie was such a gigantic fiasco that the studio behind it almost went bankrupt. After that there were no sword-and-sandals flicks made for many years. Until the turn of the century, that is. At that point the British director Ridley Scott decided to single-handedly revive the long-lost genre. And he did it with confidence and style in ""Gladiator"".

The film takes place in the year 180, when the Roman Empire is in chaos. A general is betrayed, and is forced to become a gladiator. At the Colosseum, he must fight other unfortunate men to the death.

Principal photography began in January 1999 on the Mediterranean island of Malta. But the film crew ran into trouble directly. The script was still not quite finished, and many in the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the long shot. Then things got even worse when one of the main actors, Oliver Reed, suffered a fatal heart attack before shooting could be wrapped up. The post-production company had to create a digital body for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character. A complicated (and costly) operation.

Despite its troublesome production, ""Gladiator"" became one of the year's most successful films. It grossed over $500 million worldwide. And apparently the picture is still close to Ridley Scott's heart. In the summer of 2023, more than 20 years after the original movie, he started filming ""Gladiator 2"" in Morocco.",7
30 March 2017,Never seen anything like it,"The first time I saw this movie I was 12 and I have seen it countless times since then. And I didn't have any doubts then and still don't have any now, this is without any doubt the best movie I have ever seen. The only movie that ever made me cry, the only movie that moved me in ways I never even knew. In my opinion one of the greatest masterpieces.

18 May 2001,**** 1/2 Excellent return to sword-and-sandal epics,"Ridley Scott's best film in years is this astonishing epic of Roman proportions about a great general (Russell Crowe) who is demoted to gladiator slave when the kindhearted emperor (Richard Harris) dies and his selfish and callous son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes over. The plot moves smoothly over its vast size without stopping for a second, climaxing in excellent fight scenes that combine state of the art sound effects with Scott's unbeatable visual flair. Crowe gives a star making performance as the lead, and Connie Nielsen stands out in a pretty ineffective role as the princess who must watch her brother destroy everything her beloved father worked so hard for. One of the most exciting films of the year.

17 October 2021,Facelift of 60's Sword-&-Sandal,"I've always been confused by this film's popularity, especially among supposed history nerds. It rubs me the wrong way that so many people continue to compare Master & Commander unfavorably against Gladiator when this film is such a wreck and that one is such a masterpiece.

The best thing about this film is the acting. I can't fault anyone involved. But that's where the accolades end. The dialogue is like something out of a comic book - simple and overly dramatic. The adventure elements are cut short to make room for the action, which is mostly just downright silly. The sets and costumes are comic-bookishly silly and anachronistic. The overly dramatic action score works fine for Pirates of the Caribbean, a comedy, but not so much when it's meant to be taken seriously - I honestly think this movie would have been better with less film score.

It's hard to tell what's happening in the opening battle sequence. The Romans (wearing anachronistic armor, using stirrups, shooting fire arrows and employing ballistae and testudo in a field battle) appear to be fighting an army of at least a dozen Germans. The Roman battle lines immediately disintegrate into a classic Hollywood-style m√™l√©e upon contact. The fighting involves extras tapping each other with their weapons in low-fps slow-mo. Sloppy combat between extras usually works fine in the background but not as the focus of each shot.

The dialogue in the opening scenes after the battle is extremely poor. The script that sets up the plot of the whole movie reads just like a comic book. It's even worse than the original from which it was lifted almost wholesale (The Fall of the Roman Empire).

Why are they using film score inspired by 18th century flamenco music to indicate to the audience that Maximus is from 2nd century Spain? The helmets in the colosseum are comically anachronistic and ahistorical.

Commodus is an interesting historical figure. I can't help but feel that Gladiator wasted potential by opting to be nothing more than a sloppy, ahistorical amalgamation of 1960's Rome flicks retailored for modern audiences.",5
14 October 2007,Quite simply the best epic movie ever made !,"After my recent re-viewing of the film, I felt obliged to leave a comment. Gladiator is the epic that makes all other epics look bad, it's flawless in almost every way. The music is more than top notch: Hans Zimmer has written his best score in years, the locations are astonishingly beautiful, the colors used are very well chosen and add to the certain atmosphere the movie has, the acting is brilliant: there are three Oscar-worthy performances here (Djimon Hounsou, Joaquin Phoenix, Russell Crowe)...all the elements come together just right and that's really so unique that it's a thrill to watch.

There are two things that completely make or break a movie for me: the beginning and the end. A movie can be brilliant up until the end but if that last scene disappoints, I leave the movie theater with a bad aftertaste. Luckily, in Gladiator, the ending is brilliantly haunting, which adds so much to the movie. The music accompanying the scene is one of the best fitting scene-music pieces ever. It's just indescribable.

While some may argue that it doesn't deserve all the praise it's getting because it's 'just an action-movie', I feel that it's so much more than that: the dialog is great, the acting likewise, and while the movie may have a large number of action-sequences, that's not what it's really about. It's a tale of a person, a very real person, which is a truly remarkable one.

After recently seeing Troy, 300 and Alexander, I'm convinced now more than ever, that Gladiator will be the best epic ever made for years to come ( even despite the growth in technical ability over the last few years). It's always been on my best-of list and that's not likely going to change soon. If I could give more than 10, I would, but since I can't...:-)

10/10",10
17 April 2023,"Strength and Honour, violent but extremely well produced historical epic","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with.

21 January 2007,One of the all time greatest,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

31 July 2011,Epic.,"Gladiator is one of the most epic movies ever. Grand, bloody and violent, you will be drawn to Maximus Decimus Meridius' struggle for the entirety of the film.

It starts with a concept, and Gladiator is prime film material. Historical fiction? Good and evil? Betrayal and revenge? Action? Some film concepts work, some don't. This does.

The action sequences are intense, with the creative team asking themselves, ""What can make this fight more nuts than the last? Chariots? Tigers?"" And we look to see it. Visceral and well done, the many battles are the best part of Gladiator.

Characters in Gladiator are well designed. We root for Maximus, the good guy who lost it all. We hate Commodus, the coward. We don't feel pity for the bad gladiators: they're meant to kill our hero! Maximus is well-developed for an action hero, he believes in the afterlife and has rituals.

Have I mentioned how epic Gladiator is? It's size is intimidating. The gigantic opening, the first fight, and the entrance to the Colosseum... magnificent.

Gladiator is one of the best pictures of the last decade, one of the best epics ever, and a deserving Best Picture winner. 9.3/10",9
9 January 2016,Russell Crowe was perfect cast for the role.,"The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

18 September 2001,Academy was right!,"-The Best: Russell Crowe, Connie Nielsen, the evil River Phoenix, the directing, plot, music, cinematography, the outstanding battle scenes which lead this film to be one of the best of all time. Synopsis: the whole movie. -The Worst:????????????????? -Rating: 9/10

Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is chosen to be the new emperor of Rome after Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) instead of his son Commodus (River Phoenix), which becomes a corrupt prince by killing his father and claiming himself has the new emperor of Rome. As soon as Commodus has his hands on the power he orders the army to kill General Maximus and his family. It happens that Maximus survives the attack, but not does the family that is burned and crucified alive. Maximus is found unconscious on the ground by a group of nomads who turn himself in a gladiator called Spaniard specially known for his combat skills and are these very skills that take him to Rome to fight in the Colosseum as a Gladiator. Also in Rome Maximus calls everyone's attention once more by his combat skills which moves the emperor to know who that Spaniard Gladiator is. It is in this moment that appears one of the movie's best lines: ¬ë My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix legions, loyal to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and now I will have my vengeance, in this life or in the next.'. Commodus is now frightened to see that his control of the empire is dropping and the people's love for him is each time dropping as well arranges some plan to make the new hero of Rome be forgotten in less than nothing

Once more, revealing the rest of the movie's plot would certainly be really boring and somehow useless because there's almost no one who haven't seen this masterpiece already. Regarding to the movie's evident quality there aren't needed anymore words uttered by another viewer like me, as this year's Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Start running to the Oscar ceremony as the clear favourite, Gladiator's final number of Oscars ended up being somewhat like a big disappointment (there were only five). However the awards delivered to the movie were all fair besides the Visual Effects one. I can tell that I am one of the biggest defenders of this movie, but if the recreation of one big city would have been done in some other movie it would certainly be forgotten or ignored by the academy to the nominations list, in my opinion what led to the big astonishment regarding to this effects was the fact that no one have seen the city of Rome in good old times of the empire so fully created before. It is clear to everyone's eyes that the Special Visual Effects are quite more flawless and astonishing in one of the other nominees Hollow Man. Due to it's acceptance to the big audience it is now a matter of opinion but you can't surely disagree that the effects were eye candy and all the work developed by the computer wise men should have been rewarded by the Academy (see for example the scene were Kevin Bacon disappears, only that ¬ñabout- five minutes scene will show all of you how right I am). Regarding to the other Oscars unfortunately Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stole almost all the awards that should have been given to Gladiator. It seems that critics and now the Academy are completely going nuts by those poor Tiger and Dragon that don't even appear on the movie¬Ö But now getting back to the centre of the arena where movies like this one are considered minor when compared to movies that show a cheesy and ordinary love story that should have been water down along with the boat, we have to consider ¬ëourselves' lucky to have (only) five Oscars when we should have had 11 (Special Effects out ¬ñ explained before-) Well, right now when there is lesser space for writing, before I will go back to my resting place, I should (of Course) congratulate all the ones that were responsible of bringing back Roman empire: Ridley Scott's aggressive and reachable vision, Russell Crowe's power which was capable of filling even more the Coliseum, an other powerful artist named Connie Nielsen, who by one single look meaned not what a thousand words could. See it, enjoy it, it might be tragic and get 5 Oscars instead of 11, but at least it is not tragic, ridiculous winning 11 Oscars when it should have been 5¬Ö.

8 June 2001,Yawwwwwwwn,"A great movie when it came to blood and guts. But very typical and done many, many times before.

The ending is what really did it for me. I thought it truly sucked.

After all the fighting and pain, Maximus ends up like that.

I was just so pi**ed off that I wasted 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life watching this film, for it to end just like that.

15 January 2001,A spectacular epic with a not-so-spectacular script,"The action scenes are spectacular. Men wearing bizarre costumes and armed with inventive weapons try to slash and dice each other. Very entertaining and colorful.

The plot on the other hand is not that exciting. Nothing new there. The same old characters and the same old conflicts. The script is decent enough to connect the action scenes.

15 February 2004,Breathtaking,"Probably one of the most intense combat movies I have ever seen. Gladiator delivers a great motion picture experience for those who like action movies with great stories and emotional intensity. It also tells people what entertainment was in roman times and it almost shows everything that happened in a gladiator arena. Russell Crowe is spectacular in this movie. This movie also highly deserved the best picture honors back in 2000. I give this movie a 10/10. This picture also receives the honor of being my 5th favorite movie.

13 January 2001,Glad it's over,"Well, there go two and a half hours of my life I can never retrieve.

Perhaps a better name would have been ""The Comedy of Commodus"", as I laughed through most of this travesty -- that is, when I wasn't groaning. This is the kind of ""historic epic"" that is neither historically correct in the details nor the epic it considers itself to be. The endless historical errors are mentioned in other comments and in the ""goofs"" section of the IMDB page for this movie, so there's no need to get into them here. As for the epic part ... well, I spent much of the time trying to decide which real epic was being ripped off (""Braveheart"" a lot of the time; ""Private Ryan"" definitely in the opening battle scenes, via the hectic camera work and the leached-out colors).

Let me put it this way: If you thought ""Legends of the Fall"" was a good movie, you'll probably fall for it again here.

1 March 2013,"Good, but not for the expected reasons","If you look on my top shelf of DVDs and Blu-Rays you will find pride of place given to ""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"" and ""El Cid"". I have told the story elsewhere about how bizarre English educational policies permanently altered my brain chemistry so that I became fetishistically fixated on sword and sandal epics and how death by being disembowelled by the sword became linked with stories of baby Jesus in a satanic miasma of adolescent confusion. In short, I like a good epic. I had therefore been looking forward to seeing ""Gladiator"" ever since I first heard about it. The question is, then, was it worth the wait? Short answer ‚Äì no. Long answer follows.

I liked Gladiator a lot though it took me half the film to readjust my head to what I was seeing as opposed to what I had expected to see. I would not call this film an epic and it certainly does not compare to the spectacles we used to see in the good old epics as mentioned above. Instead we get a classic Joseph Campbell-like heroes journey story in which Russell Crowe starts out holding high position as a commander of the Roman Army in the North but is betrayed, left for dead and has to fight his way back from the bottom in order to wreak the revenge of the righteous man. On this level it works superbly. Russell Crowe is the man. There can be no doubt after seeing this film that the mantle of romantic tough guy lead must pass to him for the foreseeable future. I would not say that he is a great actor (thank god) but he has the looks and the presence to make the character work. A pivotal scene in which he reveals his identity to Commodus, his nemesis, is simply fantastic.

So we end up with a film that has a very strong emotional centre. The murdered emperor Marcus Aurelius is a highly moral man who wants to pass responsibility to Crowe, not to his real son. We see the struggles that Crowe has to go through to accept the responsibility and then how, even when he becomes a slave and his family is murdered, he can still eventually do the right thing. I would guess that it is because this emotional tale is so central, rather than the fighting, that Scott has chosen to shoot so many scenes by using close-ups of the actors and that they occupy so much time on screen. In fact I think this will transfer very badly to a pan and scan TV version because he often uses close-ups with 2 heads either side of the screen with an out-of-focus centre. Nice to see a director really directing for widescreen (at least on this level).

But as for the much-touted gladiatorial scenes I have to say that I was disappointed. In the first instance the CGI is still not up to the job. We all know only a portion of the Coliseum set actually existed and the rest was computer generated. It's good but it's still not good enough. The flyover shot of the arena which has been much talked about is also good but still not good enough to make you forget you are watching a computer-generated scene in which the movements of people and animals is still too jerky to be convincing. Compared to the epics of the 50s these modern CGI scenes are not as impressive as large-scale sets.

I have to report disappointment over the actual combat too. Compare the opening, admittedly very good, battle with any battle scene from Braveheart and you will see that it is not quite as good. The man to man fighting between gladiators later in the film is even more disappointing with Scott constantly going for close-ups rather than pulling back to let us really see the action. Bruce Lee and Fred Astaire both looked brilliant because they were usually (almost always with Astaire) shot with their full bodies in frame. What made them so impressive was that you could see they used their whole bodies and most of what they were doing was not faked. In Gladiator I seldom escaped the frustrating feeling that tight camera angles were being used to compensate for the fact that the real spectacle was too difficult to depict. Oh and I have to say that men wrestling stuffed animals still looks as silly as it ever did.

I regret saying so many negative things here but I say them because the film seems to have been hyped as something it is not. It is superficially an epic but it in no way compares to the best of the original epics. In my judgement this is a film about character and the relationships between men of honour and men of opportunity. The acting from Richard Harris is as impressive as that from Crowe. Oliver Reed also turns in a good performance for his last film and we can only regret that he did not get better roles in his life. Perhaps Reed's tragedy was that he would have been perfect for epic roles as a young man but epics had become too expensive to make by then.

Ridley Scott is still, to my mind, one of the best and most innovative directors around and I rate this film highly despite my criticisms. The problem lies in the marketing. This is an excellent film but for every reason other than the ones advertised.",7
15 May 2000,very long epic with modern sensibilities,"I'm surprised that people liked this so much. It was entertaining, but I've seen several movies I thought were better already this year. I found the mismatch between the ""realism"" of the sets/props/action and the modern sensibilities expressed by the actors to be somewhat jarring. And while I enjoyed the spectacle, the attempt at being serious (which included jerky camera movements and washed out colors) got in the way of that, too. (This is in contrast to Ben-Hur, which is all spectacle.) I thought that the performances were rather good (Crowe was, as always, excellent), but Derek Jacobi was acting in the wrong movie (I think that he thought he was in Spartacus, perhaps), but somehow it all added up to less than the sum of its parts for me.

9 August 2003,Booooring!,"Gladiator is one of those movies that could never be good no matter what. The historically inaccuracy of the movie was laughable, and movies that take place thousands of years ago irritate me. I like movies that take place in the present day. The acting in the film was very good, but the story itself just wasn't suspenseful enough. Plus this movie is well over 2 hours. That is just unacceptable in my opinion. The movie could have been done in 90 minutes and that would have made it much better. I would recommend this movie to people who don't mind watching movies that take place in olden times, movies that are historically inaccurate, movies that are over two hours long, and movies with mediocre story lines. If you need help going to sleep check out this title!

22 May 2003,Epic Adventure,"Ridley Scott is a trustworthy director, and even though a couple of his movies (Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) aren't as great as his older ones (Alien, Blade Runner) he still manages to at least direct them good. Here, he takes the more Hollywood type of approach and uses camera style previously used in the 1998 feature Saving Private Ryan. What Ridley Scott understands is that to see the action, one must be in the action. He uses his this technique in Black Hawk Down with his rapid- fire photography of the battle scenes. In Blade Runner, the camera was constantly focused near Deckard. He carefully chooses his shots here and instead of just saying ""Okay, let's make it realistic"" he choses to be more detailed and shows beauty in the scenes. He should have won Best Director instead of Steven Sodernbergh. Unfortunately, John Logan and co's script ends up being mediocore at best. They are trying to dazzle the audience with a magnificent feast of old proverbs and tight dialouge, but it ends up being the typical cliche type of dialouge. Maximus is the hero, yes, but the writers smolder it in our faces showing how he can just take anyone on and still hold out well. The performances are first- rate, and even though Russell Crowe's performance was powerful it was not as good as his ""The Insider"" of which he truly should have won for. Did he deserve at least a nomination? Yes he did. In support is the always energetic and young Joaquien Phoneix as the deceptive and brutal son of the Emperor, who always seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. His performances blends craftiness and muscular strength in a beautiful tense and even if his character is a bit cliche it's not noticeable. He should have beat out Benicio Del Toro. Also in the backround is Richard Harris as the wise and friendly Emperor Commodus who wishes for war to end. His performance masterfully builds off himself and his character, and he at least deserved to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. As Commodus's daughter, Connie Nielsen provides most of the emotional work but she's harldy in the movie. There are some masterful shots here of the towering (CGI) arenas and the interesting costume designs to build upon everything. Even if the script isn't too good, the rest of the movie adds up enough to be a somewhat enjoyable experience and still one of the best movies of 2000. 8.5/10",8
27 March 2001,I Weep For American Cinema,"Everything there is to be said about this movie has already been said, so I will keep my comments brief. ""Gladiator""'s musical score is breathtaking; the rest of the movie, in all other facets, is garbage. If you generally like what the majority of the American population likes, you will enjoy this movie. If you usually prefer films with competent direction (including action scenes where you might actually *GASP* be able to see the action), intelligent dialogue (it took three people to write this?!), professional acting (brilliant death scene Russell...you really deserved that Oscar), or special effects that seem even remotely realistic, you may wish to look elsewhere. The latest in a long string of inane Best Picture choices, this is by far the worst in the history of the Academy Awards.

The only consolation for myself and those who share my opinion is that in twenty years, ""Gladiator"" will come to rest in the same category as ""Rocky"" and ""Kramer vs Kramer""--not that there were any ""Taxi Driver""s or ""Apocalypse Now""s released in 2000. If this is a sign of things to come, the future of cinema in the United States will be very grim indeed.",3

11 June 2017,Probably the best war movie of all time,"Ridley Scott's magnum opus is a specter of epic proportions- both in terms of visual treat and acting prowess. Crowe gives his best ever performance, and is the perfect portrayal of a leader- calmness in eyes during planning, intend while attacking and ruthlessness in killing, and a man who lost his family- haunted by memories of his wife and son. Joaquin gives a stirring performance as Commodus. The subtle hinds of mental insanity, raw lust and incest adds to his mysterious nature, with the hatred to him increasing steadily through the movie. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla gives a steady performance, but the portrayal of her fear of Commodus is outstanding. The emotional scenes- between Aurelius and Maximus, Maximus' first battle as a gladiator and the climax sequences- could have been overdone by glorification of the hero, but Scott does an immaculate job in creating the feeling in audience, probably by the portrayal of Maximus as any man, driven solely by his loyalty and purpose above desire.

Music by Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is instrumental in completing the feel of Roman era, with the final ""Now we are free"" being absolute goosebumps material, though on hindsight, I did find some similarity between the Pirates of Caribbean ""He's a pirate"" and the war theme.

Nevertheless, I don't find any reason why it should not be given a 10. A must watch film for all.",10
16 August 2001,The Gladiator Who Defied an Empire,"This is an excellent movie. Russell Crowe is awesome as Maximus, the Roman General turned slave, who than becomes the Gladiator that defies an empire. It's tastefully violent, there are good action scenes, but the acting was why I liked this movie. Russell Crowe was convincing as a vengeful gladiator who wants revenge from the new emperor Commodus, who kills anyone who stands in his way of being Rome's greatest emperor.

Joaquin Phoenix was a good villain as Commodus, and Connie Nielsen was also good as Commodus' terrified sister, Lucilla. There are great special effects, great costumes, great acting, and a great story.

This is a good and exciting movie that you can watch for the action or drama. I found it was funner to watch it as an action/drama, which made it all the more enjoyable. This is one of my favorite movies, and I recommend it to anyone who like the above description, because I know I do. Besides, how many other award winning movies can you see a guy get his head cut off with a large sword (not including Braveheart, because that wasn't a sword)! 9/10",
14 May 2000,The big epic that forgets about character.,"OK, everybody loves this movie, which can only make me wonder, why? Why has America become so easy to fool? We see the trailer for a film like `Gladiator' and get all pumped up and slap our $8.00 down as soon as we can. But after sitting through 2 ¬Ω hours of a slow, unoriginal story, I could feel nothing but disappointment.

Yes, I will admit that there are some cool scenes (the first fight in the Roman Coliseum is by far the best), but that's not enough to make a good movie. We start with an ok plot, but one key element is missing ¬ñ CHARACTER. None of these characters have any substance to them at all. They are all flat, stereotypical boring characters that have little to nothing of importance to say. I won't blame the actors, I think all of them have shown what they are capable of with a good script, but with a bad one ¬ñ not even the most talented of actors can save a film. So, that is probably the biggest problem here, a poor script that lacks true character development and interesting dialogue.

But the direction is also poor. It was like Ridley was trying to do a little `Saving Private Ryan' but did not succeed in doing it nearly as well. To compare it to a similar film - `Braveheart' ¬ñ we see why `Braveheart' was a much more interesting film, because it had a great bunch of characters that the audience identified with and cheered on. `Gladiator' just could not deliver, and boy ¬ñ was the ending disappointing. I'm sorry people ¬ñ if anybody can tell me why this is such a movie, please do so, but this movie just reinforces for me the idea that Hollywood will always undermine the intelligence of its audience. `Gladiator' gets a big fat 3 from me.",3

Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
16 September 2004,A clich√©d directionless mess with some good visuals,"The film opens in Ancient Germania, with a battle that could have been spectacular were it not for the choppy cameras. (Is it just me, or do dogs jumping over walls of fire seem lame?) This scene should have been the highlight of the film, but it is hard to tell what is going on.

The rest of the film really loses direction, like it can't decide whether to be political or revenge-based. Why does everyone want Commodus dead? In what way is he running a 'dictatorship'? This may have been explained but the movie is far too short. Apart from Commodus, all of the characters are 1-dimensional and tiresome. There are a few good fight scenes but they don't really fit into the story. I give this a 6/10 because there are some interesting elements (all involving Commodus, the only believable character).

20 October 2015,What was this?,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film.

12 July 2002,Have people forgotten what a GOOD movie IS??,"I am as amazed as confused at how anyone could find this movie anything less that a masterpiece. A triumph in acting, special effects, directing, setting design, costume design, plot, dialogue, and anything else associated with movie-making.

Long ago, when movies were time-spent productions, when only one movie would come out in theatres a month, when a movie earning 4 stars wasn't a rarity.. this was the time when audiences knew how good some movies could be. (Hence all the classics.) It's frightening to see today what movies have become. With 3 movies coming out each week, sometimes many more, it's hard to determine the quality from the ""merely entertaining"". Some movies have their moments. Almost every one does. A funny one-liner, a cool death scene, or a wicked plot twist. But this doesn't make up a good movie. That isn't what it's all about.

What also needs to be realized, is that when someone thinks of a movie as their ""favorite movie"" or a movie that they ""hated"", they are merely saying their opinion about it, which has nothing to do with the movie itself. Obviously what one person thinks of as a great movie is not the universal definition for cinematic greatness. (I remember my brother feeling betrayed when Corky Romano wasn't nominated for an Oscar). For example: what one person may hate about a movie, another person may love about it for the exact opposite reason (An overprotective parent may hate this movie for it's violence, while if it had been cuddles a bunnies, some ""macho man"" may have hated it too.) Truly these are not grounds to be judging movies. However, there are universal traits for movies which one can rate a movie on. (Acting, story, etc.) Perhaps this is why we have award ceremonies. Because some people can't decide for themselves what good acting really is.

As a serious movie lover, these are my strong opinions. I am merely trying to make sense of all the negative comments about this movie.

(God I wrote a lot!)

My opinion about it anyways:: In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix MADE the movie. (My FAVORITE actor!) Russell Crow was great in this type of role, but Joaquin did an AMAZING job. He was able to portray the bad guy but with soul (Something VERY difficult to do.) This was obviously overlooked however at the Oscars. The Academy must have forgotten how much easier it is to be the guy everyone loves, the ""good guy"". The story itself seems to be the reason we loved Maximus. We felt sorry for him. We wanted him to win. Whereas Joaquin was just so damn GOOD at it, you HATED Commodus within the first 5 minutes. He was so damn good at being bad. You must judge good acting NOT only by how well they preformed, but how into character, and how believable, and how 3-D their character was(not always in the actor's control), and how hard their role was to bring to life. I know this is becoming a Joaquin praise rather than a review, but I think this was the BEST I have ever seen him.

BESIDES Joaquin, the MOVIE is nothing short of spectacular. A true movie is inspiring, it's good at what it does. (In this case it can make you cry for an hour after the movie's over, feel suspense, and realize that this is more than fiction which little people do.) We need to remember that this stuff really happened. Obviously being 2000 years from the time it took place, it isn't entirely accurate. But than again, when was the last time a documentary won Best Picture? Would any of YOU see a documentary with such enthusiasm? Would it have made enough money to pay for the lavish settings and costumes the crew would have to create? NO!! Which is why it is a MOVIE. Besides, for NOT being a doc, it actually IS pretty damn accurate. Almost all the characters were real -except Maximus- and the fact that Rome was/is real at all is amazing enough. The recreations of everything to the gravel is breathtaking. The sets are so beautiful and real, you feel immediately as though you are in ancient Rome. Also the corruption and insanity that was going on with the politics back then is also there. They were murdering each other left and right! (Due to the lead poisoning.)So the themes fit as well.

It is also a very simple yet powerful story which any decent human being can sympathize and relate to. So in short, it really IS a good movie, not worthy of the ignorant, inane comments by some who probably couldn't tell a Shakespeare masterpiece from the Nutrition Facts on a Snickers Bar.

17 June 2023,Still the greatest movie ever after 23 years,"Gladiator was my favorite film when it came out 23 yrs ago and after rewatching it today with our now adult children, I realized that it still is. The cinematography is breath taking, the acting incredible, the battle scenes rival Game of Thrones and the story line is heart wrenching while the music is moving. It does not feel dated and is simply a masterpiece and felt as fresh today as it did in 2000. Luckily, one of my kids agreed and she's hard to please.

Not sure what to expect for Gladiator 2 but the fact that Ridley Scott is directing it once again, should put my mind at ease. Just concerned that it won't have as strong a lead as Russel Crow and great actors like Joaquim Phoenix and Danish actress Leslie Nielsen.

Anyway, would highly recommend Gladiator again after nog having seen it in 20 yrs. It rivals any great current film or series without all of the special effects.

26 December 2000,"""I AM SPARTACUS!!""","The opening scene here is similar to the opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan""..just substitute horses for boats, tunics for fatigues and helmets for..well..really BIG FANCY helmets. Anyway... any time a movie kicks off with a severed head, you know you're in for some rollicking family fun. Even King Arthur takes a break from Camelot to join the party.

Seems that Commodus (Phoenix) is the Marcus ""W"" Aurelius of Rome. He wants his dad's old gig. Dad wants to give the job to workingman's hero Maximus (Crowe). Ergo...bye bye, Pops. Commodus then gets ""Braveheart"" on Maximus' ass, tearing up his vegetable garden, and his wife and kid. So what we got here is a WWF-worthy death-match type conflict. And away we go.....

In the immortal words of Peter Graves in ""Airplane""..""You like to watch gladiator movies, Timmy?"". Well, you could do lots worse than this one. For starters, some neat cinematography courtesy John Mathieson. Djimon Hounsou doing his ""noble savage"" thing straight outa ""Amistad"". Derek Jacobi grabbing the ""I Claudius"" toga for a redux. Oliver Reed in a Moroccan approximation of Fagin. Connie Nielsen looking almost as good as she did in ""Devil's Advocate"". And Phoenix getting that nasty Jack Palance evil-eye thing down to a tee and pasting it onto a little Nigel Tufnel spoiled-rock-star panache. Hey. What's not to love here?

This is a real Dino De Laurentus type old-style epic. A ""Spartacus"" for x-genners. ""Gladiator"" is gonna take home a handful of awards for costuming, cinematography and scenic design, which it deserves. Not as certain about the major nominations, but nobody involved with this picture has anything to be ashamed of. Solid entertainment the way mama used to make it. And Crowe gets to go home to Meg Ryan either way...Oscar or not...and that's what I call a win-win situation, kiddies.

Saw this one on a big screen TV but if it goes back into theaters before the Oscars, I'll be on line. This has ""Panavision"" written all over it.",7
22 March 2001,What the hell was so great about this movie?,"First of all, I'll give you that the movie was visually spectacular. Yeah, great visuals, great CGI. I'll even give you that Crowe and Phoenix acted well in the movie. I didn't think it was anything special, but fine, I'll give you that.

But what the hell was the movie about?

Basically, the tagline ""he kills and kills until he kills no more"" applies to this movie. But it had no meaning. So what if his family was killed. Did anyone feel the pain outside of those stupid dream clips which is basically Ridley Scott's futile attempt to make you think about it? These characters were two dimensional. Maximus was the low-key uber-fighter. Phoenix's character was the ultimate evil. There was absolutely no story outside of who is Maximus going to fight next. Pro-wrestling offers more of a storyline.

Hey, this was a good action flick, I'd even say a great action flick. But that's all it was. This movie, IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER (IMO), separated itself from any other action flick outside of the level of visual detail and perhaps superior acting.

What bothers me is that this movie will probably beat out much better movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic, and Wonderboys for best movie of 2000, according to the ""experts"" at the Oscars. History will look back on this as a mistake. Good movie, yes. Oscar winner? No, not even Oscar nominee. 7/10.",7
29 November 2000,... sound and fury signifying nothing,"Nice visuals and a feel of an epic isn't enough to un-lameify this movie. What the hell is it about? Some guy who kicks ass as a general kicks ass as a gladiator until he kicks supreme ass. Big deal. Where's the story? What's the story? Sure, there's that little blurb about his wife and child, but there was no emotion in it.

This movie was a lame, lame knockoff of a much better Braveheart.

12 May 2023,Boring,"This is an incredibly slow movie considering the title is Gladiator. The entire plot is a solider, a general or whatever the Romans called that position, was betrayed by the new emperor and seeks revenge. This movie is 3 1/2 hours in tv and it is a political drama, nothing more. Since it is set in ancient Roman times politics did not involve money laundering, by most historical accounts it did involve some drugs of sorts and sex workers but those aspects seem to have been left out of this film and physical fights. There is no traveling in the movies so I do not see how it is an adventure and the action is minimal to the talking. The sad fact is there is little to no backstory to set up the characters and make you care about them and help you understand the motivations before it basically becomes a WWE grudge match. The customs looked good, maybe a little too clean and in good shape for gladiators, the scenery looked good, although the Colosseum did not look as big as it actually is. I have personally been to the Colosseum and it was larger than expected and did not disappoint, unlike this movie. I am still trying to figure out how someone can be crucified and burned alive at the same time, the fire used to burn them alive would burn the wood used to crucify them. I would not be thinking about how characters died at the beginning of the movie after the movie has ended if the storyline had been written better, ie having more to it to justify the 3 1/2 of tv air time it took.",4
5 May 2000,Ridley Scott does it again.,"Ridley Scott has become my favorite movie maker. Once again he has taken me to another time and another place. Although this movie does not have the soul of Blade Runner or the suspense of Alien, it is a visual masterpiece. For over two hours I was transported into the ancient world. What makes this movie great is the acting and the world according to Scott. The acting of the film veterans is just great and it holds this whole movie together. Then you have Russell Crowe who is again a presence that grabs you every time you see him. I would have followed him into battle and died for him. Bottom line is, really really great entertainment.

29 September 2005,Cant get Better,"Right from the start this film has you on the edge of your seats, with the battle of Germanai, and Maximus(Crowe) Longing to go home, I've seen this movie 5 times in the past month, and it just gets better and better, with the excellent Late Oliver Reed to the outstanding Russel Crowe, this film has to be watched several times just so you can appreciate its outstanding achievement.

In my opinion this has to be Ridley Scott's best ever film, along with the beautiful soundtrack this makes for an entertaining viewing , all i have to say is, if you haven't watched this film yet, then what the hell are you waiting for watch it now

11 February 2012,Sets an example for future films,"'Gladiator' is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once. I would highly recommend it for anyone to watch simply because it does everything a good film should do:

The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's role as Commodus where he becomes more and more creepy as the film goes on. Even Russell Crowe performs well in this film despite being a bit over-the-top in some scenes. The supporting actors of this film all perform well and there is no one in this film who lets it down.

The scenery and set designs all work well too, despite the CGI Colosseum being over-sized, the interior sets are beautiful.

The music is the main aspect of this film which is truly brilliant. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job with this film's soundtrack, especially the track at the end of the film.

This film is also shot beautifully by Ridley Scott, with the slow motion sequences at the beginning in the battle against Germania being a good example but also the tiny slow motion shots of Commodus, revealing his evil character. The story is overall very good, there are no points in the film where you are left confused and there are not loose ends.

Overall, I can see why this won Best Picture at the Oscars in 2000. It brings out emotion in viewers throughout its entirety and its tearful end will stay with you for a long time.",10
3 October 2020,What a movie!!!,"Such a masterpiece oh wow I can't find words to describe it! Russell and Russell and Russell he is one of the best actors in history and he keep proving this with his performance in each movie , also the story in general was perfect , thanks RUSSELL CROWE for that performance

8 May 2000,A Epic For A New Era...,"Gladiator is the eagerly anticipated film in the mold of such sword-and-sandal epics as Ben-Hur and Spartacus. This time, the familiar tale of a slave who defies an empire takes a violently realistic turn, giving the audience an entirely dramatic and satisfying film.

Featuring a magnificent portrayal of Legion General Maximus, our stalwart hero, by Russell Crowe, Gladiator also possesses an excellent supporting cast led by Joaquin Phoenix as the young, mad emperor Commodus, gorgeous Connie Nielsen as Commodus' sister and former love of Maximus, Lucilla, Djamon Hounsou as Juba, Maximus' staunch ally and friend, Rolf Mueller as the mighty Germanic warrior Hagen, the late, great Oliver Reed as fight promoter Proximo (his best role since Athos in Richard Lester's Musketeer films), and the immortal Richard Harris as the last great Roman emperor, Marcus Auerlius.

Gladiator is quite a spectacle, and portrays the spectacle of the Colosseum and its satellite arenas in a violent and bloody fashion. It portrays a decadent Rome crumbling in its foundation, and united only in its love of the gladiator.

Highly recommended!",

14 May 2000,"high on style, low on substance","The first half of this movie you can throw in the garbage, it's slow moving and well, flat out boring. It's the second half where the interesting stuff starts to happpen. Even the acting gets noticeably better the farther into the film we go; it's almost as if the cast is getting better as they go along - although, russel crowe was good throughout (but you'd expect that much.) Basically, the core components at work in this film are its _fight_ scenes, which range from ok to pretty good, but the direction often gets on ones nerves - the camera never really holds on to any one image for more than a split second and instead switches or flashes all over the places and what we get are dozens of little stabs and jabs, flipped quickly in front of us like cheap cartoons drawn on a deck of cards. The overall plot was also very predictable. You could see things coming at you a mile away and then cringed when the characters acted so surprised to learn the news. As I say, the last half is the films saving grace and even that could be stripped down to a much shorter version of the key gladiator fight scenes.

The best thing I can say about this film is its cinematography and the Roman backdrops are very cool. Otherwise, the film is an overhyped, predictable soap opera, with some good fight scenes filled in with a whole lot of pretty filler.",
14 March 2003,Looks Great on DVD,"I recently purchased this movie on DVD and it reminded me, if I needed reminding, what a great film it is. Its strengths are obvious - excellent acting, including memorable performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Oliver Reed, an absorbing story, superb music, and interesting photography. The latter was not to everybody's taste, nor were the scenes in Elysium, but I thought both worked rather well, lending texture to what we were watching. The movie is not the most original ever made, but does most other things so well, it can be forgiven for that. Recommended. Rating: 8/10.

15 September 2002,what a load of balls,"this is, without a doubt, the most over rated film of all time. people flocked to see this dismal, unoriginal, cheesy blockbuster, in my opinion, just cos of the good reviews, and they agreed with those reviews cos they thought they had to, just like what happened with easy rider (the previous holder of the most over rated steaming pile of poo award). russell crowe plays some irritating tough guy who won't stop whinging and joaquin pheonix wanders around aimlessly, giving a similar performance to sean penn's retard in the film 'i am sam', it's just a shame he was supposed to be playing something else. both of these actors give possibly the most diabolical performances of their careers. djimon hounsou gives a decent performance as does oliver reed (a major achievement since he entered eternal bliss half way through shooting). if you seriously like this film then it's probably cos you were too young to legally see it and so felt an enormous sense of self-pride in rebelling against the film classification authorities.

5 November 2005,Best Made Movie of all Time-there has never been another movie ever made that even comes close to achieving this level of perfection!,"Perfection!

Every single detail: from a perfect cast, to flawless acting, flawless script, the most ascetically amazing and magnificent sets of all time, costume design's are flawless, the directing and editing was absolutely brilliant: you can go frame by frame line by line detail to detail and you will not find any flaws.

Even the greatest movies of all time have either a minor plot flaw, or someone does a bad acting job, or their was a casting flaw (someone who just stuck out your head that would be better for a certain part), their is almost always flaws in a certain scene's that could be improved upon or if you could go back in time and change certain things you would. In this movie there is not one single thing in that could be improved upon down to smallest of details. Their is are not any scene's, line's, setting, or expressions in the movie that could be improved upon. No other film has ever been this perfect on so many levels. If it was possible to go back in time and re-shoot this movie again and again starting with everything the same everything, the chances of everything being executed this perfect again are extremely slim for a film of this scale.

This movie raised the bar as high as it can go and the bar cannot be raised any higher. Just like you cannot travel faster than speed of light this movie cannot be surpassed. The best any future movie can do is tie and chances of a future movie being this perfect are not very likely. You would have better chances of winning the LOTTO several times then to see another movie that is executed so perfectly in every way.

You may enjoy another movie more, because of different factors like your favorite genre or you, somehow dislike some part of this movie for some strange reason like you are scarred of a little blood or violence. But no one could logically argue that any other movie has been developed and executed this perfectly.",10

And speaking of the extended edition (only available on Blue-ray) could not only overcome in several details the original, but also be another masterpiece of Ridley Scott's career.

The film tells the story of the Roman general, the Spanish Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is on a military campaign in the barbaric Germania, led by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), which has lasted over ten years. Aurelius sees in Maximus courage and humility, and the spirit of a true leader, as a proof the love and admiration that the Roman army has for Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus nurture a big friendship and a love of father and son, which led to Aurelius appoint Maximus to be the new leader of Rome after his death, instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic again. But Maximus hesitate just because he expects his military pantry and return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified beside the door. Maximus is arrested and later sold to a gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed), which later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to revenge.

You could say that ""Gladiator"" is Ridley Scott's ""Braveheart"". As it is filmed in the same realistic and violent style, but (in my opinion) can be much more epic. The direction of Ridley Scott is a great help, along with a dazzling cinematography on each scene. Both in spectacular epic battles (inside and outside the visually stunning Coliseum) and the superb dialog scenes.

A major problem with films like ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"" was connecting the dialog with the characters, which sometimes it failed and couldn't maintain a line of fiction with true historical facts, often not loyal at all. But I think Scott knew that and hired the right screenwriter for the job, David Franzoni. The writer of ""Amistad"" along with John Logan and William Nicholson, can build a superb narrative to the film from start to finish. Achieving at the same time creating a fiction story, and be extremely loyal to historical facts of the Roman Empire.

This is mostly seen in the extended version of the film. Where we have many more dialogs between the characters never getting boring for a moment. And can demonstrate accurately the Roman political system, since the massive corruption and political rivalries within the senate and also the great imperial totalitarianism with the character of Commodus. And thanks to Scott, manages to have a good level of entertainment within the amazing story.

But for all become more epic and exciting, Scott asked the best author of soundtracks of this generation Hans-Zimmer to participate in this epic. And delivers a soundtrack that ranges from the thrilling and exciting to dramatic and chilling (as always done ever since).

And course, no one in the cast disappoints. Joaquin Phoenix didn't won the Oscar in this movie for two reasons: 1- F#ckin Critics (as always), 2- Benicio Del Toro superb performance in ""Traffic"", 3- Blue-ray versions don't compete for the Oscars. But who shines of course is Russell Crowe, with the PERFECT performance that put him on the map.

Not that the theatrical version is bad. But after watching the extended version, the original feels very incomplete. Because here it was shown the exuberant performances of all the cast; the superb direction of Ridley Scott giving spectacular and realistic epic battles; a fantastic script that while it is original, it can be historically accurate with a fantastic story of the general who became a slave, the slave that turned into a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire. It has a question in the film: ""Are you not entertained?"" All I have to answer is ""Yes, I 'am""!

17 March 2020,A true hero,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8

5 May 2000,The work of mediocrity,"I was disappointed. I did not have high expectation, but I was taken in by the word of mouth that alleges Gladiator is a great epic akin to Ben-Hur. Sorry, but Gladiator fails to beat Ben-Hur by the distance. In fact, Ben-Hur is marginally better than Gladiator.

There are problems with this film. The cinematography, however beautiful and majestic in some scenes, is murky and at times irritating -- especially the sped-up method used for chaotic effect that left me cold even in the midst of carnage (hasn't this been done already in Saving Private Ryan?). There's a lack of focused direction by Ridley Scott -- the result is too many scenes that droll on and on. I felt no empathy for the cast's stilted performance of the characters throughout the film. The editing is confounding in the heat of the major war battle and gladiator duels. Even a good performance by Russell Crowe can't save this film from being doomed to failure.

I despise the flashbacks. It's the cliche that has been done to death. That's the most irritating part of the film besides that annoying and insipid young actress girl. Right in the beginning of the film after the prologue, with the main character's hand weaving through the wheat field, I knew Chuck Rudolph was right when he murmured: ""Malick be damned"". (For those who don't get the quote -- it's a sarcastic reference to Terrence Malick's 1978 Mid-Western classic ""Days of Heaven"")

Although technically impressive, the movie fails to engage me in the story I find meandering and tedious. Though I wasn't bothered by gore, I find the audience's positive response to blood and carnage cynical and despicable, especially after the fact Dreamworks/Universal showed the TV spot comparing Gladiator-esque violence favorably to football and hockey.

It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not great as the majority of the moviegoers seem to believe. Gladiator is as mediocre as Braveheart, and that's the only compliment I have for this film.",6
27 June 2000,Neither great nor bad -- good entertainment,"This is a much quirkier film than you would expect from a gladiator epic, and it's going to disappoint some people.

First off, it is NOT history, although a few historical characters are used. In the film's defense, it really doesn't try to BE history, either, merely using historical backdrops for a morality play. Although, having said that, the opening battle use of the longbow is an anachronism, I believe; the longbow didn't come into use until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and its origin was Welsh and English. Minor point, but since I have castigated other movies on similar points ...

The performances were outstanding, subtle, and complex, even the sometimes over-the-top performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Connie Nielsen is especially effective, and for the first half of the film you're not quite sure where her character stands. I thought Oliver Reed was breathtaking in this film. It's the only film I've seen where I liked Reed, and what a shame he passed away during the filming.

The script gets pretty conventional in the second half of the film, and therefore predictable. However, the visual presentation is stunning, with washout coloring and inventive camera techniques. I can understand why these might be irritating to other filmgoers, especially if they're expecting a traditional epic. Obviously, I liked it.

Overall, it's a good film, not a great one, and not one everyone will appreciate. I think it's overall ranking is excessive, and I rated it a 7.",7
4 May 2000,"Visceral, compelling viewing","From the outset it should be said that ""Gladiator"" might appear to be a ""blokey"", ""testosterone pumping"" blood'n'guts movie. Nothing could be further from the truth.

A conspiracy of glorious photography, inspired direction and a powerfully immaculate performance by Russell Crowe transports the audience to ancient Rome. And the journey is immersive, visceral and compelling. ""Gladiator"" is a rivetting story of treachery, tragedy, deception and revenge and is made memorable by unforgettable performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, et al.

Joaquin delivers as Commodus, a simpering, treacherous psychopath with an apparently unfulfilled lust for his sister Lucilla and a penchant for over-vigorous paternal hugging. Ollie Reed (RIP) gives a cracker of a performance as sports agent, Proximo, whose catch cry should be ""show me the denari"". He literally throws his clients to the wolves.

But all the acting accolades should be showered on Russell Crowe. He thrives on the pressure of appearing in nearly every scene, a burden which would demolish a lesser actor, and he is absolutely mesmerising. What a talent.

Ridley Scott has bestowed upon us a cinematic masterpiece. This is not just a 160 minute blockbuster it is a seminal event in movie making.",10
13 September 2004,"Powerful, Engaging, And Exhilarating Masterpiece","""Gladiator"" has some of the best elements I have ever seen in a film. This is an invigorating, passionate, potent, and beautiful production, in almost listless ways. The direction is near impeccable, chronicling a simple tale of injustice and revenge in such a powerful, under- standing, and reverent manner to both the trials and conflicts of Maximus and the oppressive, grandiose atmosphere of Ancient Rome. Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is beyond brilliant, perfecting nearly every confliction, strength, and intensity his character possesses and experiences; his attitude is fierce, his movements suggest he is disturbed, and his actions prove he is ready to ""have his vengeance"", and Crowe provides everything he can to make Maximus one of the most compelling characters to ever grace the screen. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, Maximus's enemy and the man who has robbed him of virtually everything he once possessed, is vicious, brooding, and bitter, as he nearly perfects this antipathetic role, where we love to hate this villain, and root for Maximus to achieve his demise. Everything else, from the riveting, stirring, and flat-out indelible music, some of the most portentous and potent in film, to the dialogue between the characters, containing some of the most memorable lines (e.g. ""What we do in life echoes in eternity""), to the fast-paced, involving cinematography, to the incredible realistic look of the visual effects (One would never believe the audience in the Colosseum wasn't entirely there, or for that matter, the Colosseum!), and on and on and on. This is the quintessential revenge and Roman Empire story, executed in a near impeccable and rousing manner. A true sensation of film-making genius. **** out of ****",10
27 November 2021,Pleasantly Surprised,"For a Ridley Scott film, I'm surprised by the number of historical inacuracies but it doesn't matter as the script and acting sells it 100%. Very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. Stars docked for excessive flashbacks to serve as emotional beats (okay, we get it, he misses his family) and that ending. Felt unfinished. Like what happens next? The flashbacks and cuts really give me sting 2000 vibes. Also the weird offhand comments about sex are big 2000 energy. I'm sure this will get remade in my lifetime and I don't have a problem with that as it could be improved. But it's certainly watchable and good for discussion. Again, what was up with that ending?!

21 May 2000,Mediocrity - How Ridley Scott yet again neglects the script in favour of the image,"It wasn't surprising really. I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.

Are we so easily satisfied with mediocrity that we can praise this ramshackle, gloomy hi-tech affair as being the first 'epic' of the year 2000? Surely not. Even the highpoints of the film; the opening battle scenes and the chariots vs gladiators coliseum fight come nowhere near to matching the virtuoso displays in Saving Private Ryan and Spartacus.

For the rest, give me a script instead of computer-generated images which if I want to watch I can do so on one of my son's computer games.

Now if Mr Jacobi had been a screenwriter ...",1
13 May 2000,The first true epic in a while,"Wow.

I went into this film pretty sure I would hate it. Wow. I was pretty impressed. It has been a long time since I have seen a film that had an epic feel to it in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur did.. Not that it is a perfect film or anything. It is great escapism. Russell Crowe is fantastic - MAXIMUS. How can you go wrong with Ancient Rome and all those great latin names?

The art direction was very good - thank god they covered the actors in dirt. It always sucks to see clean and pristine 20th century actors portraying characters from the middle ages or ancient times.

I thought also that this was one of the first big budget films to really pull off using some surreal effects. Often they stick out like a sore thumb, but I felt they were very effective in this film.

The only problem I had with the film I think was that when Maximus was taken to the desert and made a gladiator, the whole sequence of events was too short. He's taken away, he is sold into gladiator slavery, he rises to the top of the gladiators, and then he is sent back to Rome to fight for the emperor. It needed to be spread out just a little. I know it was a long film, but another few minutes in that part of the film would have done wonders.

I particularly liked the camera work during the fight sequences. Very nice.",9
4 January 2001,True Epic .,"Okay, Gladiator is not high art. There are huge gaping holes in the screenplay. Much of the story is predictable and some special effects are just plain silly. However, this movie is great escapist fun with magnificent acting especially from Russell Crowe whose towering presence defines the whole film. It is a chance for us to get lost for a little while in a different world. Ridley Scott looks at Ancient Rome with a truly epic vision and shows the horror of the gladiator games with a terrifying reality that is also pure entertainment.Reccomended.

24 September 2000,Would make William proud,"How good is the movie Gladiator? Let me count the ways. One, the direction is beautiful. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, has done an impressive job by creating a gritty dark look much like Saving Private Ryan did. Two, the performances are great. The characters have deep feelings and emotions, and are portrayed beautifully by a great collection of actors. Three, the script and the story sounds like Shakespeare. While it is not, if Shakespeare were to have written a story about a gladiator, it would be this movie. And finally, four, the action makes sense and makes you jump at the same time. This is one of the best movies not only of the year, not only of the decade, but also of all time.

Some critics have called it depressing. Well, it is in a way. There is little or no color to the film. Like I said, the cinematography is similar to Saving Private Ryan. The story is also a little depressing, but just about every story ever made is depressing if you think about it. The ending to some people may not seem happy. But, to those of you who have seen the film, the main character Maximus found exactly what he was looking for and wanted so bad.

I'm now about to give away the story, but if you have seen the preview you know it anyway. Russell Crowe plays as Maximus, general of Roman's army in Germania. He is the best general in Rome's army and is admired by the emperor as a son. But all Maximus wants is to return home to his wife and son. The emperor's son, Comodeus, is selfish and wants the throne now before his father can hand it over to the senate. As you guess, Comodeus kills his father and blames Maximus for the crime because of his father's love for him. Maximus escapes only to find his wife and son have been assassinated by the new emperor.

Maximus is picked up and sold as a slave where he must fight as a gladiator to win food. Here his master learns of Maximus's tragedy and tells how he too was betrayed by the emperor. His master takes Maximus and his other gladiator slaves to Rome to compete in the 180 days of games ceremony set up by the new Caesar.

The fight scenes are quick and bloody. Sometimes it is hard to see what is happening. It took me a few minutes to get used to the angles and wild motions of the camera. This is not a movie for children for the blood gets almost unbearable at times. However, fight scenes are not what this movie is about though the trailers may deceive you. This is a movie about redemption, revenge, war, and peace.

The thing that impressed me most about Gladiator is how well it is written. The words move as smoothly as the story. The plot reminds me of Shakespeare. A general becomes a slave because of a jealous emperor. The slave who became a gladiator. A gladiator who defied that emperor. And how that gladiator found his revenge. The ending scene reminds me of so many Shakespeare plays its almost funny. As much as I want to tell you about it, I won't. This isn't as much a movie as it is an experience. An experience that no one should miss.

By the way, for all you a**holes who gripe about how films like this are unrealistic, well, that isn't why it was made. Few movies are made to be history lessons, and when they are they suck like anything. Realism is important, but historical accuracy is not. This movie is made to be entertaining, and it accomplishes that like no movie I've ever seen.

Even if you didn't like it, but it for the fact that it's on two discs; TWO FOR GOD's SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9
2 May 2000,Hell of a ride,"A combination of all the best parts of Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and The Lion King, Gladiator opens, carrying itself like the great Roman war machine portrayed, then grabs the viewer and drags them through the story of Maximus. His adoption into the gladiator lifestyle is almost as intense and emotional off the battle field as it is on. Where Braveheart called for the audience to laugh or be shocked by the images on screen, Gladiator carries a much more personal feeling to their battles (mainly due to the size), allowing them to rile up much more emotional steam that has ever been seen in a war epic. A veiwer must wonder as they watch, is it right that I support the brutality, is it right that I am rooting for a man to kill another? It's quite an emotional movie, wait until you see it.

Despite the moral conflict, the movie is still amazing. Russell Crowe is, as always, amazing, and Joaquin Phoenix has turned what is probably his best performance of his career. Ridley Scott's directing is excellent, keeping true to the worn, hot, aged feel of a gladiator movie, while at the same time, incorporating many techniques to heighten the experience, going inside the minds of the characters.

It runs around two and a half hours, not too long for a Gladiator pic, and is naughtily entertaining. Lots of blood. Lots of gory battles. Lots of extremely exciting battles, everything a gladiator movie should have.",9
26 December 2005,Unique...wonderful.,"This is along the lines of what every other comment has been getting at, but I can't stress it enough.

""Gladiator.""...wonderful, dazzling, spectacular action scenes. Maybe the action is like that of ""Troy""...

...but Gladiator is unique, unlike Troy, it is not cheesy...or corny for that matter. For it's genre, the epic, big screen epic film, it is unique.

We get our action and our beautiful sets and all that good stuff that Troy had....but we also get wonderful acting, good directing, good music...you name it, ""Gladiator"" probobaly has it.

Some might have gone in to the theater expecting a popcorn box-office summer hit that may get a visual effect nomination or a minor Oscar...but mixing the action that movies like Troy have, and combining it with the talents of Sir Ridley Scott, we get so much more then a summer hit.

We get an Oscar winning, unique, wonderful film.

...and even if one can not see what is so unique and non...cheesy about this film, then they can just enjoy the action, right?",8
3 September 2000,Excellent Film,"Excellent fight scenes, excellent plot (wow, a film with a *real* story!) and very long (nearly 3 hours).

I believe Russell Crowe was perfectly cast as Maximus. Maximus is a hero with loyalty to his country and to the old caesar, but especially to his family. He has the loyalty of his army behind him so is adored by just about everybody.

Commodus, the whining, cringing, cowardly git was played well by Joaquin Phoenix. As was his sister. She came across to me as being the real emperor of Rome, while her brother was really a whimpering SOB.

What beautiful scenery! Computer effects of Rome was eye candy to behold! See computer-animated tigers and blood!

The fight scenes were not as gory as I expected. I have seen far worse! Some of these fight scenes, especially the ones which take place in the Colliseum in Rome, are quite spectacular. Shows how the blood thirsty citizens of ancient Rome love to be entertained... (much like todays' blood thirsty movie audiences who love to be entertained by trash like... dare I say... Hollow Man!!!)

CONCLUSION: This film is a must see.",10
4 April 2002,"Great movie, depicts Gladiator games well.","I found Gladiator's plot and storyline really well brought together. There are hardly any flaws in this movie, as with plot holes, filming, or acting. This is a great example of how a movie should be made, how the acting should be done, and how the drama should be characterized.

Hans Zimmer once again pulls through with a great soundtrack. The battle music is really pumped up, and the more mellow tunes really add to the dramatic themes of the movie.

Russell Crowe is a great actor, as well as the remaining cast. The movie has been put together extremely well and will live on as one of Ridley Scott's epics. It's too bad we can no longer see this outstanding movie in theaters.

19 April 2021,"Unoriginal, drab, mundane. The only thing that makes Maximus the protagonist is disgust for Commodus!","I'll keep this simple. Spare yourself the time and watch a much better movie like Spartacus instead, even the TV series is awesome. In that you actually have a protagonist to root for. Maximus is just an obedient general to the emperor Marcus Aurelius who has slaughtered many people in the name of the emperor, whereas Spartacus is about freeing the people born into slavery and the overall breaking of obedience to the ruthless masters, but I digress. That in of itself is not what makes this a sub par movie it's just one more thing that adds to it.

To check out a much better more detailed review of this movie, I recommend checking out Roger Ebert's review, which is pretty spot on.

26 March 2023,"""Gladiator"": A Majestic Epic that Captivates and Inspires","""Gladiator"" is a stunning epic film that showcases the strength of the human spirit and the power of redemption. Set in ancient Rome, the movie tells the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a fierce and loyal general who is betrayed by the corrupt and power-hungry emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus is forced into slavery and is forced to fight as a gladiator, but his passion for revenge fuels his determination to survive and seek justice for his family.

Directed by Ridley Scott, ""Gladiator"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transports viewers to the heart of ancient Rome. The attention to detail in the sets, costumes, and battle scenes is breathtaking, and the performances of the cast are outstanding. Crowe delivers a powerful and emotional portrayal of Maximus, while Phoenix shines as the despicable Commodus.

The film's themes of honor, loyalty, and sacrifice are woven throughout the narrative, and are portrayed with a depth and sensitivity that resonates with audiences. The battles scenes are visceral and intense, yet the film never loses sight of the humanity of its characters.

At its core, ""Gladiator"" is a story of triumph over adversity, of the strength of the human spirit to rise above even the most brutal of circumstances. It is a film that inspires and captivates, leaving viewers with a sense of awe and wonder.

In short, ""Gladiator"" is a cinematic tour de force that deserves to be seen and celebrated. It is a majestic epic that will leave a lasting impression on those who experience it.",10
15 November 2022,For the glory of the empire in 2022 and beyond in times to come.,"Thank you kindly for the opportunity to write as a free man who respects the history of mankind.

Academia and the society of filmmakers share a long and correlative history reaching back to the empire when architects and stonemasons built the great cathedrals of Europe.

Masons learned their craft, encompassing geometry, physics, drafting, and related subjects in what I know to be the first schools of engineering. Writers such as David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson were expressed by director Ridley Scott in a display of one story that can be found in every culture today. Gladiator.

The churches they helped build also became centers of study in theology, art, and music, giving rise today in a universality where arts and sciences flourish today. Some examples for those who consider themselves film lovers.

My words about a movie with entertainment only purposes should help provide the young with the best examples of mankind. As able and ambitious young men continue onward, in tribute to the actors and their families may I continue to write words for the public to view.

A toast to all the cast & crew in what is among so-called epic films to our university brethren:

May we ever be Entered Apprentices to virtue, Fellows of the Craft with knowledge, and Masters of truth and integrity. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Russell Crowe as Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Oliver Reed as Proximo. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius. Derek Jacobi as Gracchus. Djimon Hounsou as Juba. And rest of cast and crew credited, uncredited, including but not limited to special editions for the glory of the empire, of course.

21 March 2005,Padded out to make it feel more 'epic',"Gladiator is a long film. Epic films are supposed to be long. But somehow Gladiator doesn't feel like an epic film. Sure, it deals with the rise and fall of a Roman Emperor, has spectacular battle scenes, a nearly spectacular CGI Colosseum, and everyone speaks in the clipped 'BBC English' accent that we all know they used in Roman times, but somehow the story doesn't carry enough weight.

We feel bad for Maximus when he's betrayed, and we hate the villain and want him to get his comeuppance. But we don't give a toss about the Roman people, who are portrayed as a bloodthirsty mob, so why should we want them to be freed from their tyrannical emperor? It works better as a personal revenge tale than as a chapter in the history of the Roman Empire.

The script is weighed down with pretentious and meaningless pronouncements (""Rome is an idea""?) and the plot is too full of coincidences. The action sequences are well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) and none of the actors embarrass themselves, but overall this is an above average film that has ideas above its station.",7
28 December 2000,Disappointment will rise.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",1
30 October 2013,Finally Saw This Movie,"It took a long time but I finally saw Gladiator. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix star in a story I have seen plenty of times in movies. The story is simple. Guy in high power gets betrayed by a jealous brother and falls to the bottom and has to climb back up to gain his vengeance. How many times have I seen this? A lot. How many times does it work really well? A lot. In Gladiator it works really well. Everything from the acting to action worked in this movie.

Like I said the plot is basic but it works. I have seen this movie before just with a different setting and characters. Russell Crowe is a general for the Roman Empire, Maximus, and his father who adopted him is dying wants him to take over the empire. Commodus, Phoenix, is the rightful heir to the throne because he is blood related but he takes his brother out of the picture anyway by betraying him and murdering his family. Maximus survives and becomes a Gladiator to get his revenge. I figured out the ending to this movie and most of the key plot points but it was still amazing.

Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance in this movie, winning him an Oscar. Crowe has an amazing talent for acting and this was his best performance. Luckily he didn't sing. His best scene is when he finds his family dead. He has an emotional breakdown. Another when Commodus is tempting Maximus to fight and he keeps his composure. Any normal man would have broken down but he kept his cool. Maximus is a very interesting character and a natural leader.

I don't know why Joaquin Phoenix's career went down the tubes but he comes through in the clutch in this movie. Commodus is one of the creepiest villains in any movie. He stalks his nephew and wants to sleep with his sister. His jealousy and anger towards Maximus drives his performance. When he is on screen its intense. His emotion escalates rather quickly. Phoenix got nominated for an Oscar and I think he deserved it.

The fighting scenes in this movie were top of the line. My favorite being the one with the tigers. I saw the tiger come out and I went nuts. I was pumped and as unrealistic as it was, it was awesome. The Colosseum looked real and amazing. The lack of CGI shows and it makes the movie better. Watching this I pictured the making of the movie and the set. The sands of the Colosseum were probably real and the first section of seating was probably used with extras. The second two had to be CGI for budget common sense but the movie felt real.

I watched the director's cut of this movie so it was really long. Honestly I got a little bored and most of the added in scenes I could spot out. There was a lot of filler that didn't need to be in there. I took that into account when thinking back on the movie. The regular version is probably a lot better and cleaned up but the backstory was still interesting.

Character relationships are obviously very important and none was creepier than the one with Commodus and his sister. Many times in the movie he tries to kiss his sister. There comes a point where he demands she give birth to his future son. That's messed up. It shows how sick his character is. I understand power hungry but this guy was 110% crazy. Maximus is a great leader and has great relationships with his soldiers. There is the one huge guy and the other black guy he befriends and they are both incredible. Secondary characters like that are important and they do their part.

Overall, Gladiator is a masterpiece and I don't know why I waited so long to see it. Hans Zimmer adds an excellent score and captures the emotional part of the movie. Ridley Scott directs this film in the right into the academy awards and he really let his stars shine. Crowe and Phoenix give it their all and help push this movie to get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",8

20 May 2000,I was disappointed,"I heard and read that this film is a classic, and thus I expected a really great film. But it's not the case. This film has a serious lack of character development despite it lasts 2 and a half hours. Together with the character development, we can see a poor ambient development. We just see a huge coliseum and thousands of people computer-generated. Just that. We don't see closeups, we can't see the feelings involved, and we feel no empathy at all (for a good example of a well done job, see Kubrick¬¥s Spartacus). The camera moves in the fight scenes are acceptable for films like Saving Private Ryan, set in a time where cameras did exist, but not for a Romans' film... They just seem to be used to make us more difficult to find goofs, and that is a dirty trick in a so expensive movie. Another point is the acting. The actors are not bad, but they don't look like people from the 2nd century. OK, nobody knows how they were, but I am sure they weren't like people from the 20th century. I mean, the dialogue, the way they move, the feelings they show. You can use the same acting and the same music in a film set in the Middle Ages and we wouldn't note the change. If we forget that Ridley Scott is the director and Steven Spielberg is the man behind the production company, we just have a mediocre film. I still can't believe that The Sixth Sense got no oscars and American Beauty took them all. Mr. Spielberg, you are rich enough yet, so please let talented people do their thing and stop your 'This is the greatest film ever' propaganda in a Microsoft style! And you, people, please look with your own eyes and don't follow the stream. Dreamworks is making really good products, but not everything is gold...",7
24 November 2000,Roman Spectacle Movie Revived!,"In the tradition of Ben Hur and Spartacus, Gladiator scores big. Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman General, is magnificent.

Life in Rome in the second century A.D., is portrayed realistically. The battle scenes at the beginning of the film take your breath away with their excitement and authenticity.

Highly recommended.

26 January 2004,Not as good as others say,"Well first off, I thought this movie was a rip off of Braveheart. It was very predictable. I knew every thing that would happen after the first 10 mins of the movie. The characters were interesting, but I did not have any feelings for them. This movie is highly over rated. There is nothing new at all in it. The story has been done may times before. The characters were forgettable. The movie seemed to be an excuse to show fighting with some sort of story built around it.

13 August 2000,Freedom Fighter,"What is the price for freedom? Once I read about a Jewish concentration camp prisoner who is survived fully, because he is able to free himself inside the camp. Freedom from the fear and mental tortures in which he received during his 3 years of imprisonment. Physical tortures and isolation is better compared to mental and thought imprisonment. Nelson Mandela once said 'They can kept me away, but the will not kept away my thoughts and ideas' Maximus Decimus Meridius (if I'm not mistaken), a top rate Roman general, is offered a choice between coming home to his family Spain or take another duty in Rome. He cannot say no and half heartedly decide to rule Rome and stand up for the people and the republic for the glory of the Roman Empire. A condition which was changed by the corrupt politicians and tyrants. Alas, the Empire died and replaced by his son, a disfunctional characters longing for love and acceptance from his father, the last Caesar.

Maximus overuled the Caesar and deserted until he was stranded at the gladiator arena. And we are dealing with the imperfect characters; Maximus who is imprisoned by his own rage and pain towards his family, Caesar who is imprisoned by his own fear and hunger for love, his sister who is trapped in her fear and love towards his brother and son and in between good and evil. The audience was placed perfectly in the screen. From the magnificent opening, the barbarian and bloody fights in the collosseum, through many colossal acts and supportive CGI. Russel Crowe (Virtuosity, the Quick and the Dead, the Insider), the humble hero arise not because he is well built like Arnold or with Bruce Willis sinister look. It's because he is merely integrated with the casts and the atmosphere built by the talented movie crews. And so the Gladiator arise, towards the fight for the freedom. A freedom more than just physical, which asks us about how we're dealing towards our own imprisonment. Freedom from fear, hate, anything. Destined to be another Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Black Rain, Alien, Thelma & Louise) masterpiece, the movie itself speaks with the same ambience like his previous movies. So typical and make us stop and think after the movie ends...",9
30 January 2002,"not original, hollywood propaganda","Wow what can I say, stealing things from Sparticus and Braveheart? Give me a break, whenever my father watches this movie I laugh because all this money goes into a project like this, and its just no good. I didn't find this movie fun, just a boring piece of material. When I saw it the first time I thought it was okay, but now that I watch it I fall asleep almost everytime.

18 January 2002,An awesome cinematic triumph,"This film, in my opinion, is not only the best that came out of 2000 but one of the best films ever produced. The acting is superb and the story is very engaging and filled with pure, unadulterated action and thrills from beginning to end. I think it richly deserved all of the awards and kudos it has received.

3 October 2001,Have you looked at it twice?,"I used to be a big Ridley Scott fan, when masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner made me think he was almost Kubrick's peer.

Since 1492, yet, I wonder who is actually this guy. I just can't believe someone can change so much from artistic craftmanship to commercial fast mediocre production.

All of his movies since 1492 has been merely average Hollywood productions, with solid scenery and photography I agree, but nothing more than Roland Joff√© or some other directors. And his movies then respected all of Holywood's codification, would it be for the music, the editing etc... CLICHES!!

And Scott was almost forgotten by the cinephiles...

With Gladiator, suddenly, Scott makes a ""come-back"", with a lot of advertising... Then what is it?

Well, to me, it's the same Ridley Scott who made 1492.

While Gladiator has a brillant photography, the poor psychology, the mediocre scenery and the bad editing turns the whole thing into an average peplum with lots of visual effects to compensate the lack of substance.

Sure, some scenes are very good, Ridley has a lot of savoir-faire then is able to make some very good shots just because he's fundamentally talented.

But I simply can't understand how so many people just can't see the vacuity of this film, and the mediocrity of its production!

So my question to all the people who rated this film with reverential ""10"" is: Have you actually looked at it twice, and AFTER all the hype?",4
9 June 2004,A movie for the more philistine viewer,"It is a pity that the type of person who thinks that this movie is ""great"" is the same type of person who thinks that a Clint Eastwood movie is better than a John Wayne movie, and who is interested in shallowness and simplicity, shallow entertainment with no depth. Such viewers would be perfect public at the Colisseum where the final struggle takes place. The movie is a rather poor remake of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", a movie which was not memorable but which had some point to it, for it showed the way in which the Northern blonde people were shamelessly butchered which provoked the reaction which was to seal the fate of Rome. That movie had a more elaborate story and showed how a system can go wrong. There is a worrying trend in these epic remakes such as Gladiator, The Passion of the Christ and to a much lesser extent Troy (Troy is actually quite a good movie) for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to Roman times. It is almost like we have become blood thirsty and unchristian.

11 June 2000,"Hmmmm... well, not the worst film I have seen.","I dunno. I was really excited about going to see Scott's new film, I am a big fan of his work. Also, I did part of my undergraduate degree in Ancient History and find Marcus Aureliuz and his reasons for appointing Commodus to be very interesting. However, I am not one of those picky historians who needs to have every little detail correct. I realize that film is a fictional medium and accept fully that it will NOT represent historical events accurately, but will alter them to fit the dramatic needs of the story (no one criticizes Shakespeare for doing the same thing, so why attack others). Hence, I will not dwell on historical inaccuracies... there were a few, but they did not impact my appreciation of the film.*

Regardless of any of these things, the movies just wasn't that good. The characters were not particularly engaging and the battle scenes were so staged that there was little, if any, serious tension. I am not really sure what this is, but Gladiator was simply not very exciting.

Aside from this, the plot was not really germaine to anything that happened in the film. The characters were sort of placed into the film without any real sense of context for their actions or motivations. The individual stories that were being told within the movie were not particularly interesting nor did they serve to advance the main plot significantly. None of this would have been a problem if there had been more action, or more emotion or more... well, something.

The acting was good, but the dialogue and story were so generic and dull that this really could not save the film overall. Richard Harris was good, but underused. Joaquin Phoenix was fine, but really wasn't given much to do. Most of the supporting characters were far too one dimensional to allow the actors to shine through.

Essentially, this film did all of the things wrong that Braveheart did right (another historically innacurrate, but far superior film) and suffered because of it. It is truly unfortunate, because I have a certain love for historical dramas when done well (I even liked Titanic), hopefully Mel Gibson will save the genre once again with The Patriot.



* Well, there was one that bothered me a bit, the film attempted to end on an up note, but if I remember my Roman history, the death of Commodus lead to a century of civil war and destruction. This leads me to question Scott's choice of time and historical characters. A similar film could have been set much earlier, dealing with Nero or Caligula and been more consistent with historical events... oh well.",6
7 February 2020,Great acting across the board,"Rarely do we see movies with casting that makes all the movie enjoyable from start to finish. I've watched this one about 5 times. Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, Harris, Hounsou, and the others were placed well. It ends up being about a man who had everything taken from him and finds himself taking a stand for the people against one who wished to rule by his own will. Crowe gets some good lines like ""Are you entertained?"" And last blockbuster line at the end when he reveals who he is. This movie gave Phoenix real notoriety with his acting. Back when i saw it, that was clear.

7 May 2002,Average epic,"I'm still trying to figure out if ""Gladiator"" is trying to criticize the human tendency to gravitate towards gruesome, grotesque spectacle or appeal to it. I suspect the former, as the film is so frequently shot in bland earth tones and dimly lit settings that it's rarely appealing to the eyes. One of the characters calls the human race ""shadows and dust"" and it's a decent metaphor, but did Ridley Scott have to use it as a visual motif so constantly?

Far from terrible, yet not the Oscar-worthy triumph it has been lauded as, ""Gladiator"" was instrumental in Russel Crowe's rise as Hollywood's current darling, thanks to his performance as the wronged soldier Maximus. And Crowe does show moments of brilliance in the film, but for my money he's not the most watchable part of it. That honor goes to Joaquin Phoenix, as the emporer Commodus. Commodus is an interesting character study: weak while fancying himself strong, he seems plagued by insecurity even as he grasps at the power which he believes himself to be entitled to. He yearns for adoration--from the public and from his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen)--yet his every action proves him unworthy of it. He's pathetic, yet it is his weaknesses which make him so dangerous.

For his own part, Crowe has little more to do than brood over his revenge. His wife and son have been murdered by Commodus--innocent victims of the latter's ascention to the throne, which also claimed the old emporer (the ever-stately Richard Harris). En route, Maximus seeks the aid of Lucilla, who pays lip service to her brother in order to protect herself and her young son. Nielsen is fine, but she and Crowe don't really strike sparks on the screen together, and the past relationship of the characters is never clear. The numerous fight scenes are also muddy, with spurts of blood the only clear image emerging from those ever-present shadows. Scott has also made the error of speeding up the footage in several scenes. Presumably intended to mirror the chaos of battle, the motions instead call to mind the feel of a silent-picture comedy. There are flashes of genuine emotion and charm here, but they emerge from stretches of film that can only be described as murky.",
10 August 2005,One of the best,"There's no such thing as a perfect movie and i don't think that Gladiator is even near that. But this movie takes a could be basic 80's style action film (like mad max or any steven segal movie)and turns it into a cinematic masterpiece. Ridley Scott is known to make C class concepts into A style movies (Blade Runner) and knows what he's doing and how. the Cinematography is perfect and this is a film for almost everyone to enjoy. If you like rich dialog and cinematography, then this is your film. If you like action and intense war scene, then this is your film. Joaquin Phoenix steals ever scene he is in as he plays the Empire son, who becomes Empire himself. Russell Crowe as much as everyone hate always gives his greatest performance ever (even though he is very good in L.A. confidential). Oliver Reed (Goodfellas) also gives a humorous but heartfelt performance as Maximus' owner who was once a Gladiator himself, this would also mark the last Oliver Reed film unfortunately as he died after filming. Dijmon Hounsou (Amastad, In America) also did a good job as well, surprised me for the most as he was only a model prior to this. But this movie overall isn't the best i have seen, but it should be recognized as one of the best. If you haven't seen this movie go and rent it, you won't be disappointed. 8 out 10",8
20 March 2005,Best movie ever,"I think Gladiator is really the best movie I've ever seen. Everything is just perfect, the image, the story and of course the music. The first time I saw the movie I was really overwhelmed by the movie. Than I rented it a dozen times before I could buy it. Since the time the movie came out I've seen him at least 30 times. And now I'm still overwhelmed by the feeling the movie gives me. It just the most perfect movie there is!!!

The movie starts with a great opening, the only bad thing about the opening and maybe the whole movie is that when the soldiers fire the missiles you can see very good that this missiles are animated by a computer, they go to straight to be real. After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good. From the beginning till the end you just are watching as if you were there, this is meanly done by the music which fits perfectly by the pictures you see. Great work from Hans Zimmer just like the latest movie King Arthur.

2 June 2001,Crap,"I hate to think that I am just getting old, but so many movies of late just don't cut it. Independence Day was junk, Titanic won every major award except for writing and acting, and now this. It had been done before, in a way in the Fall of the Roman Empire. I like Russell Crowe, but what did he do special here.

The few new ideas may get some recognition, but it looks like most just have to repeat old themes with jingoist anthems.

3 May 2022,A Worthy Best Picture,"Back when good crowd pleasing movies still won best picture Oscars, the Gladiator is a perfect example of an action movie done right and a truly great historical drama. Gladiator is not among my favorite movies of all time, but I also don't have a single bad thing to say about it. This is an epic movie that paved the way for many imitators but none that come close to how good Gladiator is.

27 December 2000,Just one of those movies...,"I saw this movie first when it came out on the big screen, but unfortunately was not able to fully appreciate it because of the people in the movie theater. Fortunately this Christmas I received the DVD as a gift and was delighted when I watched it. It is just one of those movies that when it ended I wanted to know more. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to EVERYONE! So if you have not seen it yet, please do!

27 June 2000,This film rocks!,"This is an epic with no questions asked. Ridley Scott has done his job here. Russell Crowe is a force. His character comes off as a mix between the Terminator and Rambo. He commands every scene and has that ""God-like"" presence. He plays Maximus, the commander of the Roman Army who is sent to die by Ceasar's son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). But when he escapes, he has to join up with these prisoners and fight battles. This film is going to live for a very long time. It has the Braveheart quality but much cooler battle scenes. It may be long but it flows by quickly. I have to give it a 10. Russell Crow is the new action hero and I think he should go the way of Nick Cage(Oscar nod followed by a string of action films). Let's get him two guns, John Woo, and call it a day. He is such a force on screen, you can't help but call him ""The Man"". Gladiator is a must see and a can't miss. It should be number 1 or 2 on all must see film lists.

21 May 2002,What a waste of time.,"Movies are supposed to be about suspension of disbelief. Nothing in this movie had me convinced that any of it could happen. Russel Crowe only made it harder not to turn it off. If not for my wife enjoying his looks, this movie would have been out of the DVD player five minutes in.

By the way, the effects are horrible too.

10 May 2000,Oh my God!,"This movie for lack of a better word was spectacular!! One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life! I just say it yesterday and I am still in shock. I didn't know movie makers can do such things but apparently they can. Russell Crowe is who really surprised me because I didn't expect such a great job. The Backgrounds and the settings looked amazing and so did the fight scenes. There was nothing in this movie at all that I didn't like. It was flawless, the perfect movie. I wish they could make a sequel!! Its about time someone came out with a movie like this. If I could write more I would but I am utterly left speechless after this one. Bravo!! Bravo!! Encore Maximus, Encore!!

10 December 2014,Shiould be a limit over 10,"This is the best movie ever made.

I have to write 10 lines, but my first one says it all.

Russell Crowe does one of his best performances here, as do Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and least but not last Oliver Reed. He (Oliver) died during filming, so they had to replace some of his scenes with stand-ins and computer generated graphics, which was very well done.

He did a very memorable appearance in this film, though, as did all the stars.

Russel Crowe has a reputation of being hard to work with, and I'm not sure if he was in this movie, but his chemistry with the other actors (especially Djimon Hounsou) appears excellent here.

This will probably be my favorite film for decades to come.

Just see it, and don't take my word for it.",10
22 July 2000,Absolutely Breathtaking,"Gladiator was one of the few films that was as good as I expected it to be. It was an entertaining, interesting, impressive and absolutely breathtaking drama that will burn in my memory. Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant, his performances goes beyond The Insider and he is destined to be the next Kevin Spacey. Connie Neilsen is also very good, she makes for a great supporting actress. It is not only the acting that will take your breath away, the direction, sound, effects and editing are noticeable and should easily get a mention from the academy.

I highly recommend Gladiator, it covers all fields with perfection,and it will entertain you as well as move you.

29 May 2000,An enjoyable mess!,"Talk about an oxymoron! This movie was, in general, a disappointment. Nonetheless, I enjoyed watching it. It started out beautifully. The opening sequence was fantastic! The cinematography, mainly in the first few minutes of the movie, but throughout the entire length of the movie was wondrous. Yet, the story went from interesting and inviting to plain stupid. At first I thought this movie would be a direct remake of ""The Fall Of The Roman Empire"", but unfortunately it was not. Somewhere along the line, this movie lost its balance. I think it happened at the point where Maximus leaves ""Germania"" in search of his family. It seemed as if the director of this movie tried to take elements from ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Spartacus"", and incorporate them with the main story from ""The Fall Of The Roman Empire"". The fight scenes were astonishing, though too many special effects were used in this movie...at certain moments in the movie I felt like if I was watching ""The Phantom Menace""--ugh! All those things contributed to making this movie a mess. However, I would surely recommend this movie to others. Although this movie is more than two hours long, it's not boring. The most notable thing I can say about Russell Crowe is: America, meet your newest star! For those who weren't familiar with him or his work prior to this movie, prepare yourselves. He's the next big thing--everyone else move over. He's got the talent, the looks, and the presence to become a movie STAR. Also, I liked seeing the great Richard Harris as the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, I was impressed by Connie Nielsen. At first I thought, why cast a Danish actress in a role that could easily be played by an American or British actress? But she really did a fine job in this movie. In addition, I liked the costumes, though they were too unrealistic, but they were striking. On the other hand, so much money was spent on special effects to show how wonderful ancient Rome was; yet in the entire movie, you only get to see a couple of minutes of shots of the city. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was terrible, though he does have the look of a villain....maybe when he's older he'll make a better villain in a movie. While the ending was very similar to the ending in ""Braveheart"", I feel that toward the end, this movie redeemed itself. The last twenty or so minutes of this movie were pretty good. I just might go see this movie again, for the action scenes. **1/2 out of ****. By the way, wasn't that the kid from ""Life Is Beautiful"" playing Russell Crowe's son?",
16 May 2000,Braveheart meets Private Ryan in 180 AD!,"This movie was Excellent. The first 10 minutes were intense as advertised. Sound effects for battle gave me a Saving Private Ryan flashback. Some of the same actors and Action as Braveheart.

I was little disappointed in the extent of the Jitter, almost Digital like video effects in some fight scenes. It doesn't add anything to the scenes. It could make you wonder if they are covering up special effects flaws. Why not just show the action?

Still a worthwhile movie. A bit slow in parts but you got to know the characters and see their pain, suffering, greed, lust, revenge and honor. Great performances by Crowe and Phoenix.

A great adventure. War and Life or death situations were brutal then, beyond what some think. People did pay to see people die in battle for entertainment.

I would see it again!",9
26 February 2001,"They don't make Best Picture nominees the way they used to, I guess","""Gladiator"" is a good movie, but I'm amazed at how many people gave it ten out of ten stars. I know standards fall as time goes on, but that's a rating that should be reserved for a movie that will stay with you for years to come. All About Eve is such a movie; so is the Godfather. This isn't going to be one.

Don't get me wrong, it's great to see old pros (Reed and Harris) and relatively new pros (Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Hounsou) go through their paces; Crowe in particular is better than I've ever seen him before. However, the plot is well worn, the dialogue occasionally lapses into silliness, and the CGIs bother me. I can remember a time (was it really only two decades ago?) when filmmakers who wanted a mindbogglingly spectacular set built one--they did the work, they spent the bucks, they expended the sweat. The CGI Colosseum seems like cheating, somehow, and several other shots are so obviously faked, they detract from the action.

Speaking of the action, it is quite good. Scott has definitely lost none of his knack for tense pacing; I was surprised to see that two hours had gone by and I hadn't even felt them. The fight scenes are not only believable, which isn't even remotely a given in action movies, they're so entertaining they inspire not only excitement but a vague sense of guilt. And after being weaned on the mega-buff steroid stallions of the 80s and early 90s, it's very nice to see the athletic but not Conanesque Maximus in action.

All in all, a good flick, but I'm pulling for Traffic or Crouching Tiger to take home the gold statues. This just isn't the kind of movie that deserves them.",8
15 January 2001,"""Braveheart"" it isn't.","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6

3 August 2007,Impressive epic with the help of CGI,"First time you watch this movie you are blown away by the sheer spectacle on the screen,but after repeated viewings you'll find a typical action-flick driven by the typical revenge plot of hero avenges dead loved ones. I am as everybody else impressed by the CGI effects in the movie, but compared to real thing of thousands of extras in the golden age of the Hollywood spectacle, there is no comparison. Russell Crowe is very good in his part and cuts an impressive figure,but the part doesn't allow him the opportunity for any broader characterization. The one actor who impresses in this movie is Oliver Reed. In his last role he is magnificent. Joaquin Phoenix performance as Commodus didn't impress me. He made the emperor into a pathetic human being instead of the deranged and dangerous Commodus. Connie Nielsen as his sister did an acceptable job. Nice seeing those great British stars of the sixties: Richard Harris,Oliver Reed and David Hemmings.

20 June 2000,Wonderful Crowe combined with amazing action,"Russell Crowe has a definite presence on the big screen and he makes Gladiator his own as Maximus, a general in ancient Rome. Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being. The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths. Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.

Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.

The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome. Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.

16 June 2000,Eye Candy for the Bored,"A visual delight indeed. This film appears to be a facetious attempt toward Hollywood and the 21st century moviegoer. It is a true mess of celluloid. While the film possesses a visual charm, it tends to stray in to an array of images that leave the senses feeling sick. It is a difficult film to watch because so much resides on imagery than on historical importance. Yes, it has action, suspense,and beautiful people to look upon (and some ugly) yet, it is forgettable. Scott seems like he lost control of the picture and I don't blame him for the script is so one dimensional and portrayed by the actors on such a corny level-what is one to do? Well, a smart director would give Hollywood and the comfortably numb what they want, A mindless romp through the Roman Empire using high tech imagery and pop celtic/fantasy music to leave us agasped. This is what we get for the money spent? The pop culture eats it up while the higher culture sulks in it's humility for buying a ticket.

7 May 2000,The ancient Roman epic genre is well-served by Ridley Scott's new film.,"GLADIATOR

Over 30 years has elapsed since the heyday of the epic spectaculars of the ancient world. Ridley Scott, director of `Blade Runner,' `Alien,' and `Thelma & Louise,' has brought his fine sense of visuals to renew the genre in his latest film, `Gladiator.' The jumping off point in Roman history is very close to Anthony Mann's `Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964). Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), Roman emperor, is trying to finish off the barbarian hordes who have been attacking at the northern edge of the empire at the Germanic border. Maximus (Russell Crowe), his top general, is ready to finish off the enemy and does in a brutal Saving Private Ryan-like battle. As a matter of fact, he does such a great job, Aurelius wants him to be his successor, passing over the emperor's own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Of course, the overlooked son will have none of this and these circumstances set up the relationships and vengeance for the remainder of the saga. Connie Nielsen portrays Commodus' widowed sister and former lover of Maximus. The rest of the film continues from the northern empire to the north of Africa where Maximus is trained as a gladiator and ultimately back to Rome itself where the final conflicts play themselves out.

The film owes much to the epics of the 50's and 60's. The look and style of film is definitely current. However, the small gladiatorial arena in Africa is reminiscent of `Spartacus.' Later sequences in the great Roman Coliseum recall `Quo Vadis,' `Barabbas,' and even `Ben-Hur'. The performances are uniformly good, especially Oliver Reed as slave owner and gladiator trainer, Proximo. Reed died three weeks before filming was completed and computer graphics were utilized to scan his face on another actor to complete his scenes. Other computer-generated effects are unnoticeable for the most part, but some matte paintings are obvious as such, though quite effective.

Of course, most viewers have come for the action sequences seen briefly in the previews and talk show promotions. The action is fast with lots of quick cutting making some of the conflicts difficult to follow. However, they do have a visceral effect, as those early scenes in Private Ryan did. It is fortunate that the connecting dialogue material is smooth and not over-ripe as some of the similar exposition in the 50's-60's films. Phoenix is particularly fine in actually making the viewer sympathize with him. Christopher Plummer played the role way over the top in the earlier `Roman Empire' epic. Nielsen has some genuinely emotional moments with him as incest rears its ugly head, a topic not even hinted at in the earlier film. Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd were quite wooden in the parts here played by Crowe and Nielsen. Loren always had trouble being natural in English-speaking roles in her early career. Her rare interior and exterior beauty often compensated for that.

Scott has created a realistic, though sometimes stylized, ancient world. Viewers hungry for the majesty and conflict of those classic films will not be disappointed. The magnificent widescreen cinematography, best viewed on a large screen, will surely help the 2 hours and 34 minutes seem faster moving than much shorter films today. Hopefully, this film will be a revival of a much-loved genre of years gone by.",8
11 August 2001,Very good but overrated.,"Gladiator is a very good movie. Russel Crow and Jaquin Pheonix both give quality performances and the movie is exciting and fun. The gladiator scenes in this movie were done well and interesting to watch, even though I have no idea how realistic they are. Still this movie is definatly not best picture quality. The screenplay is good, not great, and the story is really only slightly better than average. This movie has many similarities to another movie I felt was overrated, Braveheart. It's still very good, just not great. I give Gladiator an 8 out of 10.

22 December 2000,What Ever Happened to Baby Comodus?,"You've probably seen this film or you will in the near future regardless of what this review says. With that established, probably the most fascinating thing about this film is that it plays out almost exactly like _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_ for men. The conflict between Phoenix and Crowe for the approval/authority of the father figure (at least on Phoenix's side) parallels very closely with that of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the earlier film. Seriously. Watch both of them and then try to say that you can't possibly imagine Phoenix breaking out into that creepy ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" song. Ugh.

16 February 2002,Lincoln as Gladiator,"This is a magnificent Ridley Scott film, honoured by a sensational score from Hans Zimmer.

Gladiator has all of the visual flare that you come to expect from Ridley Scott, this time enhanced by brilliant use of computer graphics (note the rendering of Rome). Hans Zimmer produces a good score, featuring also Lisa Gerrard.

Oliver Reed does himself justice in what turns out to be his valedictory role.

My final thought is that at the end of the film, just before succumbing to his trecherous wounds from Commodus, the title gladiator Maximus announces 'free my men'! He is clearly President LINCOLN all along, playing out a noble quest to free all slaves and democratise the nation. This is reinforced by the final, end tribute from the freed black gladiator who says that they've all been freed by Maximus.

NB. Buy this on the special edition DVD, which features tons of stuff on the music (interview with Hans Zimmer), making of, documentaries about gladiators, etc. the DVD is brilliant!",10
2 April 2001,How could this win best picture!!!??,"How is it that a movie with such bad acting, predictable plot outlines and poor writing could win best picture? This movie made myself and my friends all incredibly restless in the theatre and count the minutes until it was over. Yes i am a chick, but i was accompanied by a group of 5 straight male friends, and all of us thought that there was not enough action and too much cheese. Sure rent the movie, and like it even, (parts of it that is...), but vote it best picture? Come on now!

26 March 2001,Not Best Picture Material - but Entertaining,"The biggest mystery about this film is that Russell Crow got the Best Actor award. His performance was the least impressive of all the Best Actor nominees. Four extremely talented actors with outstanding performances lost to a TV movie of the week performance. How does that happen? He wasn't even cast well. How can you make a Gladiator movie without the beefcake! Russell Crow never exposes ""the gladiator's"" outrageous upper body. He's always covered up. Perhaps we should thank him for that. Don't get me wrong...it's an entertaining view...just got way too much credit.

Russell Crowe is great in the lead role and Joaquin Phoenix should receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Commodus. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a historical epic or just something to rent for the weekend. 9/10

21 April 2001,Well done but overrated !,"I was a little disappointed in this movie, what with all its Academy Award hype. This was a good movie, well worth your time but this was not a great movie. The story line was borrowed from a half dozen different movies depicting gladiators. The acting was professional but the only Academy Award performance I saw was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and that part was so small it had no impact on the film. Definitely not family fare as it is very bloody from start to finish. Preview this movie but it would become very tiring in any film library. I rated this a 7.

2 June 2000,One of the year's highlights?,"Any movie not plugged for mass hysteria and advancements of special effects that seem to occur with every movie released promising unique and original experiences is literally a must-see. Although the film currently co-incides with the release of ""Mission Impossible 2"", this is definitely the more intelligible and less senseless of the two. ""Gladiator"" proves that an epic can be good, produced on a massive scale and not run over three hours. Sometimes two and a half hours however, is still not enough to finish a large popcorn and drink.

One of the most noticeable elements of the film is its breathtaking cinematography, much of it possible by the special effects and beautiful European locations, not reliant on exploding helicopters, let alone the flaming city of the Rome. Spectacular battle sequences, a glimpse into an interpretation of the afterlife and even the employment of the simple slow motion technique provide handsome treats for the eyes.

Russell Crowe is the general turned slave, turned gladiator, turned risen hero, turned Hollywood star. His rugged, reluctant performance is naturally the centrepiece of the movie, although almost the entire cast turns in good performances, enhanced by an above average screenplay.

The only disappointing performance is from Joaquain Phoenix, whose pompous Commodus evokes a road company Peter Ustinov as Emperor Nero from ""Quo Vadis"", only no one will be handing any Academy Award nominations or nods of any sort to him. In terms of the possible bouquets handed out to ""Gladiator"", come February 2001, it looks like the film will be receiving a whole lot of them.

""Gladiator"" evokes the classic epics of the Golden Era, ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"" and the definitive biblical epic, ""Quo Vadis."" Although the latter was filmed under more strained, theatrical-like conditions now almost fifty years ago, ""Gladiator"" is reminiscent of the film, albeit a more attractive looking one. Its plot line even seems to be similar, Ancient Rome, corrupt authorities, handsome hero falling for the forbidden fruit...a woman, even if Crowe's has a sense of partial fidelity amid faith and personal devastation.

The success of ""Gladiator"" has been enjoyed, primarily because the current generation has yet to see such a grand, lavish epic. Since I am fifteen, I can truthfully state this is the only large scale, true historical epic I have ever seen, made in the current day. Since there's enough historical accuracy, heroes, special effects and gory battle violent sequences, which insures box office and something for everyone, there's enough in this film to convince me that, for now, Hollywood may be capable once again of occasionally making films like they used to.

3 June 2000,Great entertainment!!!,"While this movie is not the best Ridley Scott movie ever, Blade Runner is, it is an excellent way to be entertained. It is a fun summer movie that isn't stupid!!! As opposed to most blockbusters from the summer season, this movie has a plot! And not a bad one. Granted, it is not highly original, and it certainly isn't exceptional, but it is very appropriate for the movie. Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, is very simple, but Crowe has the power to make you care about him, and believe in what he believes. A very good hero indeed. Joaquin Phoenix is satisfying as Commodus, but he relies too heavily on the same techniques to make you feel how is character feels. But he makes you hate Commodus and, that is his role in the movie: the bad guy. He does it well but not incredibly well. Connie Nielsen is good as Lucinda. So, the cast is good, particularly Crowe as the hero. Ridley Scott's directing is perfect. The confusion of the arena is well portrayed, and you see very well how horrible this place was. The sets are incredible, and you can't say what is real and what is CGI. The action sequences are thrilling. As I said earlier, the story isn't too deep or original but it works. Gladiator is a really entertaining movie with a satisfying story.

24 September 2019,Modern Epic,"Historical epics used to be ""the thing."" Nobody is making Ben Hur today, but at least we have Gladiator. It has all the best aspects of the genre: a great hero, a nasty villain, a love story, huge crowds, dazzling locations, and strong music.

8 May 2000,Absolutely Riveting,"This movie was absolutely riveting from minute one to the end. The performances were perfect, the dialogue literate, the cinematography beautiful, the direction controlled and sublime. The plot itself is vaguely reminiscent of several other historical epics, with its tale of family treachery, vengeance and the evil son vying for his father's attention. There are action scenes in this movie that had me practically leaping out of my seat with exhilaration. I highly recommend this to everyone!

1 May 2020,An impressive movie,"The movie is really impressive. It reflected the atmosphere of the period very well. It takes you to Rome of the time. It successfully brings the pagan Roman of the period to the eyes of the audience. The movie reflects the lifestyle in Rome quite well. It shows that senators elected by the people in the nonsense of the Republic think only of their own interests. While watching the movie, you can see that Westerners and Romans disregard human life just for fun. It tells people that they killed them without pity and that they did not give a little value to human life. At the same time, this movie can be seen as a kind of personal development that tells people what dignity, honor, character and virtue are and how they are.

9 September 2006,"Pure ""Goodness""","Take one part awesome, one part incredible, and one part inspiring and you have one of the greatest movies of all time. Easily on my top ten list this movie ""defines"" good movie making. With incredible cinematic deftness Mr. Scott has outdone himself, I doubt he will ever be able to top this masterpiece he has created with no little help from incredible actors, Crowe, Phoenix, and the rest of the spectacular cast helped to bring life to this film in ways I have never seen before. The talent brought on by all creative teams involved is amazing and I can only hope that more films will follow in the footsteps of excellence that this fine production has laid out. A true 10 without question.

6 September 2001,A grim and gritty classic,"I love a good melodrama, and this is a grim and gritty classic, full of vengeful tooth-gnashing and visceral battles. Crowe's performance is moody and believable (his Richard Burton impression is very impressive), and he's backed by some great acting from Phoenix and Nielson. Veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed make the whole affair that bit classier, and it's a fine swan song for the latter.

So what if the plot is an old chestnut, we haven't seen this kind of film for a while, and it's done very well. Protestations of historical inaccuracies should be ignored ¬ñ it's a sad day when we can't enjoy a spirited yarn without being force-fed a history lesson, for no other reason than to keep the pedants happy.

Mention should be made of the effective CGI utilised to bring ancient Rome to life, and the impressive (if vaguely familiar) score. Lots of little touches combine to make this superb entertainment, the best film Scott has given us in some time. It's very much a movie that should have been seen at the cinema, but if you missed it there the DVD version is great and reasonably stocked with extras. Pull the chair closer to the TV and enjoy.",7
26 March 2009,Fairly Ordinary,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",5
15 July 2000,"Wow, I never thought history could be so cool!","I recently saw 'Gladiator' in the cinema and all I could think of when the movie had ended was: ""Wow! That was cool!"" I always loved Rome in the history lessons, but this is really great! The battle scenes were terrific, the blood splattered everywhere but the feeling was there! A big A+ for Ridley Scott ( oh, by the way, Alien was good too! ) and for Russel Crowe ( loved ya, man! ). This movie deserves an Oscar -- make it five -- and it should be reviewed as one of the best movies of this year! I just had some problems with eating when remembering the bloody scenes. But I'm happy I saw it.

3 July 2000,So far the most realistic historical movie on Romans,"This movie is the most realistic historical movie on Romans produced so far. The first 10 minutes (battle in Germania) are so real that you feel like you just did a time travel. The computer work on ancient Rome is beautiful and pretty much correct. Although the plot is simple, acting is superb. The violence is disturbing, but that only adds to the realism of the movie. Nothing for weak stomachs, but if you can stand the violence, you are in for a treat. One of Ridley Scotts best movies, maybe the best since Alien and Blade Runner.

15 September 2001,"A triumphant and magnificant story about loyality and love, good over evil, and heroism","Gladiator is a film about loyality and love, good over evil, and heroism, and one of the best i've ever seen. It's truly an inspirational film, and the best film of 2000. This IS Russell Crowe's most memorable performance in his career, and also Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is amazing from beginning to end and has lots of special stunts and very cool fights. When i saw this movie i was blown away, i give it **** out of *****

12 May 2000,"Brutal, bloody, loud and great","Saw this the day it came out over here. Had been waiting for it for a seriously long time. Lived up to my expectations.

Loads of typical epic elements are present in this film. Death, glory, love, lust, blood and adventure. The overall plot isn't too different from Spartacus, but should be treated as a completely different film. I mean to say that there can't be just one film on Roman gladiators. There's no point in making a benchmark of a film. It just limits the possibilities.

The actors were brilliant, and most of all Crowe, who just slips into every role he gets with the greatest amount of ease. We've now discovered a new generation of good actors, and definitely in the form of Crowe. Harris' short-lived role was well played, and the late Oliver Reed puts in a marvellous performance as Proximo (an honourary post-humous award of some description wouldn't go amiss!). Phoenix was relly menacing in his place, and made me hate his character's guts!

The camerawork in some places was reminiscent of that of Janusz Kaminski in Saving Private Ryan. It's a good technique that gives the audience the feeling of chaos and atmosphere. Ridley Scott uses his usual flair to produce some excellent visuals, like the Collisseum (even though over half of it was CGI).

Last but not least, Hans Zimmer's score was perfectly suited to the task of capturing action and intimate moments in the film. During the battle scenes the music often sounds like Gustav Holst's 'Mars, Bringer of War' from his Planets suite. Very good idea. Well suited to the scenes of combat and war.

Overall, Gladiator is an amazing spectacle. And I'd like to finish by saying: RUSSELL CROWE RULES!! But I won't (lol)",10
5 May 2001,Absolutely the best of 2000!,"It's been a year today since I first saw ""Gladiator"" at the movies and it's beyond me why it took me so long to write a review for it but here it is now. Russell Crowe plays the title role (Maximus) to perfection and makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Winning an Oscar as Best Actor (it was really a consolation prize for his loss last year for ""The Insider"") made me VERY happy and he was very humble and dignified while making his acceptance speech at the Oscars in March. Joaquin Phoenix made an incredible breakthrough as the villain Commodus and should have won the supporting actor Oscar for his performance, while Miss Connie Nielsen is convincing as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and Maximus' love interest (but only as a lukewarm love interest since he has eyes really for his late wife). The sets which also should have won (they lost to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but the brilliant costumes won so there is some consolation in that) and the score as well. The Academy is just getting more and more benevolent in regards to splitting the awards evenly between several different movies. But ""Gladiator"" by far is the winner of the year. Viva la Crowe!!!",9
9 August 2000,This film insulted me,"This was without doubt one of the worst messes of a film I have seen for a long, long time. I hated all but the first 5 minutes - it took the film that long to alienate itself from me.

Here are the charges I level against it: 1, boring 2, pathetically unbelievable plot 3, deeply homophobic - the villain was ""anti-man"" and to make the point stronger he was presented effeminately. In one scene we see him pouring lustfully over his sleeping 8-year-old nephew. The fact that he also sought sex with his sister does not remove this charge, this was simply to add to his unnaturalness. 4, appalling computer graphics 5, needlessly gruesome violence that managed to glamorise violence and reduced us to the level of the crowd watching the gladiators in the colloseum. 6, too long 7, the actor playing the villain was entirely unintelligible.

One good point was Russell Crowe, but he should have known better than to get embroiled in this disgrace.

16 May 2000,Probably the last of the great Roman epics,"We've trodden this route before. Anyone familiar with the Kirk Douglases and Charlton Hestons of the world will recognise what this film is about. It was interesting to note the number of elderly people in the cinema, another indication that this film was a throwback to a bygone era.

Having said that, it was visually stunning, the cinematography added another dimension to this genre. The battle scenes were vivid and exciting and the scenes in the colleseum kept me enthralled. Russell Crowe was a fitting choice for the part of Maximus and generally it was well cast apart from the irritating Lucius. Oliver Reed chose the perfect vehicle for his swansong and filmic epitaph.

Despite enjoying it as a thrilling spectacular and not finding it long at over two and a half hours, at the end of the film I did have a certain sense of deja-vu. Apart from technological advances there was nothing new that would differentiate this film from the the Cecil B de Mille epics. Still, I ask myself is there anything wrong with turning out a good old-fashioned movie with all the tricks that entertained previous generations.

However, there was something about it that left me pondering that as we are now in the year 2000, perhaps we demand a little bit more. Maybe we've spent too many years watching too many films to be surprised, and that's my biggest gripe - there was nothing surprising or unexpected about this film.

Still perhaps I'm over complaining. I felt I got my moneys worth and would certainly recommend it to anyone who was unsure as whether to go or not. There is a lot to enjoy about this movie and I suppose if it happens to be on the box on a Good Friday in a few years time, I'll probably tune in again. So it's a thumbs up from me!",

30 May 2000,As good as a concept movie gets/a perfect Verhoeven pic shot by Ridley Scott,"`Gladiator` is the symbol of Hollywood`s renewed intrest in medieval subjects and stories.Since techno-thriller self-destructed under the burden of Hollywood`s commercial expectations enchant history became the new well of ideas for moguls.This is why `The 13th Warrior` hit the silver screen and why `Joan of Arc` got funding from Hollywood.`Gladiator` takes as back to the past when Western Civilisation wasn`t as great as we know it since the majority of people weren`t aware that there is only one God. `Gladiator` is the story of the Roman general Maximus who gets involved in royal plots during the time of Marcus Aurelius` reign.Because of his position he gets punished but he escapes death.Unfortunately his family gets slaughtered and he becomes a slave that ends up as a gladiator in Roman Arena.In Rome Maximus plots to avenge his family`s death and to take Roman Empire back to the right path. `Gladiator` is a competent return to`swords and sandals` mythology and the movie doesn`t fail where it`s predecesors did.It is expensive,large-scale story with great actors.Performances of Russell Crowe and Oliver Reed are especially enjoyable and Joaquin Phoenix really gives edge to the character of Commodus,the villain Emperor.Russell Crowe iz amazing and his acting really fits the epic scale of characters behaving and tragedy. Since `L.A.Confidential` it was obvious that Crowe is `the next big thing` and he finally proved it again in `Gladiator`. The script has fine moments but it is generally routine stuff.It isn`t edgy but it does make mistakes concerning history.I mean I ain`t no historian but authors avoid the religious aspect of the plot.Even though Crowe prays to one God while the young `Replacement Emperor` and his sister use plural in religious conversations. The ending is a nice idea but it is bad written and bad writing includes cheesy lines spoken by `as hard as it gets` Crowe. `Gladiator` also features a supportng role Djimon Hounsou the `Dream Works SKG nigger`(remember him in `Amistad` also made by `Dream Works SKG`?). Ridley Scott`s direction is mature and atractive and he proves true the thing Michael Mann said about him to Crowe(Mann said that Scott is among top two percent of shooters in business).His direction is inspired in visual sense and thus he gives us some hot sword fighting and animal action.The shots of Arena in all it`s glory are impressive and kudos also go to cinematographer John Mathieson who shot Kevin Allen`s masterpiece `Twin Town`.Ridley Scott can`t avoid the classic `Dream Works SKG` blueish colour orientation but this is a legit landmark of the studio.... Overall `Gladiator` is a must-see not because of it`s substance but because of the fact that it interprets some of the classic myths of human culture in the manner of a 100-million studio picture which is fine. I hope that great box-office result of this movie would boost production of such anticipated projects like Michael Mann`s `Spartans` with George Clooney and Verhoeven`s `Crusade` with Arnold Scwarzenegger. If Verhoeven had directed `Gladiator` it would have been a masterpiece.",7
19 June 2000,uneven,"A general in ancient Rome is betrayed by a corrupt emperor and sent to die in an arena as a gladiator. Potentially good Indomitable Human Spirit film is marred by inconsistent direction, somewhat primitive special effects and holes in the plot. Brisk pacing and decent character development work in its favor. (Rating B+)

26 May 2002,garbage,"Its too bad this film has such a loyal fanbase right now, because it is a complete waste of time and film. This film was made to appeal to the Academy, but actually had nothing special in it except for maybe its budget. Russell Crowe is terrible, and I don't know when everyone will realize it. He can play one character and one character only, that being the smart-alec dead-pan monotone type. I liked him in The Insider because that was the first movie I saw him in. His acting style suited the part very well. Then I saw Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind and realized how bad he actually is. His characters are all the same and never allow the audience to see any emotion, and don't allow us to buy into his characters' motivations. Russell Crowe wasn't the only terrible one however. I don't think a single character was likable or even remotely interesting. This film is just another example of a good plot that was ruined by the actors and director. Its too bad the Academy only focuses on domestic gross and a movie's ability to look ""cool"". Only redeeming factor in this movie was that it could hold the viewer's attention, thus I give it a 3/10

27 December 2000,"Common Historical Misconceptions Clarified: (just the facts, ma'am)","ESSENTIAL TO THE PLOT and you might want to know:

Commodus did indeed fight gladiators in the arena. Sort of a fixation thing. Needless to say, he arranged to win -- yes, *every* time. Insane emperors were dicey. *Stupid* emperors simply did not go the distance.

Roman citizens were *never* enslaved within the empire (this includes Spain), no matter what they did. Never. They were executed in Rome (for major treason) or banished (for anything less). Stray slavers did *not* just pick up tired or wounded folks left on the road. Any Roman citizen would 1) have on a ring of citizenship to proclaim his inviolability or 2) be given every courtesy once declared. Citizenship was precious and worth many lives -- you did *not* mess with Citizens of Rome. This was *not* a democracy. Maximus would *never* have been enslaved on such a ridiculous pretense. Sheesh.

Make no mistake: The ARMY was the *real* power in Rome. --They had the swords-- *Not* the unarmed populace (this is laughable). *Not* the solitary emperor. Proof? The entire Roman Empire was auctioned to the highest bidder by the Praetorian Guard (the only armed troops within the city) 1 year after Commodus and his shortlived successor were murdered. Beyond the guard, the greatest threat was a successful general with a vast and loyal following in the legions. And the army outnumbered the Praetorians. By a LOT. So just imagine Maximus getting hauled away for execution within sight of his vast, victorious and worshipping army. WITH Commodus in the camp. Ridiculous. 'Might' wins every time. Commodus would never have been so idiotic as to have even approached his camp. His father, yes. He did actually attend this battle. He was secure. But Commodus? Ridiculous.

Roman generals were quite politically sophisticated. This was part of the job as the upper eschelon of Roman power. NO Roman general would have so annoyed an 'emperor elect' as Maximus did when he refused to shake hands with Commodus. No Roman general could have been so politically inept. No Roman general would have expected this rebellious gesture to be ignored. And where are the Preatorians (right here near the emperor!) and where are the army (10 feet away)? This is not only a tactical, but a strategic event. Think here! It's what generals do best. Give EVERY successful Roman general credit for his survival instincts. ANYone (even a slave) at this juncture would have done the required thing (shake hands) and then MET HIS ARMY to engineer a coup. He needed his (vast, victorious, worshiping) army to acquire power. No Roman general (no human being!) would have been so dense as to make a damning futile gesture when his power base was only 10 feet away celebrating a major victory, just waiting for him to make his move. Sheesh.

EXTRANEOUS TO THE PLOT, but you might want to know (the credits clearly state this movie is fiction):

You were hoodwinked if you thought that battle scene was realistic. The Roman army was primarily effective because of its supremely structured and disciplined front *line*. Barbarians fought as a mob and were often defeated even if outnumbered several to one--simply because they could not break that line. The chaotic beginning battle scene is straight out of the Middle Ages and has *nothing* to do with Rome. You saw a classic 'free-for-all' (or 'melee') out of the age of knights. Fun, but not Rome. Romans would have held their line and moved foward as an intact, solid unit, thrusting ecnomically upward with their short swords (never meant for this wasteful barbarian 'swinging' business) as they went.

Romans fought only to secure Rome and make some denarii. Glory was *not* part of the program. Forget that. Remember: Barbarians overran Rome in the end--they never stopped being a threat, esp. the Germans. AND Romans became *very* venal once conquest began. GREEDY and SCARED. That about does it. Skip that glory bull. They sure did.

Regarding Maximus fighting hand-to-hand in the beginning battle. Julius Caesar occasionally fought so when his troops needed some fortitude (granted as infantry, not horsed). We remember this because it was unusual. Perhaps Maximus was unusual also. (?)

The Republic was so long and so deeply dead that it is *comedy* to suggest that Maximus (or even Jupiter) could bring it back. Senators had been merely pawns since Octavian. It could not have been brought back 200 years earlier, either. It was also *not* a democracy--not by a long shot. This is pure Hollywood playing to your emotions. Slavery was so part of the infra-structure that the revolt of Spartacus (in Julius Caesar's time) ended with 6,000 slaves crucifed every 1,000 feet on the major road out of Rome (the Appian Way). Not exactly democratic. Think about it. You going south for a vacation this summer? Nice view.

Romans did not kneel to pray. They stood and covered their heads with their toga. And their idols were *not* tiny little figures of their immediate family. The idea would be shocking to a Roman.

Marcus Auraelius named Commodus as his heir when his son was 5. Commodus reigned for 12 years. Indeed, he was *not* a nice person.

Skip the stirrups. They arrive much later.

Above? just the high points. Read others in this list for more.",3

22 May 2000,Strength and honor,"When one boils down all the elements of ""Gladiator"", this is the one phrase in the entire film that stands out the most to me. These are ultimately the words Maximus (played by a stunning, rawly powerful Russell Crowe) lives by and dies by. To most of us at the other end of the two millenia mark, the idea is corny, a punchline for a bad joke (indeed, I felt that this have been the point of the little satirical presentation outside the Collusium). For soldiers, men who put their lives on the line every day, it's a way of life. It's what kept Maximus going, even after everything he ever loved or fought for (the ideal of Rome, the emperor that he fought under for so many years, his family) were no more. There's no honor in going to your grave with business unfinished. To finish it, therefore, you need strength. As the Romans were always hailed as a practical people, the motto makes perfect sense to me.

But ""Strength and honor"" go beyond even that simple definition in the film's context. Not only does Maximus use his strength to survive another brutal day in the arena against five heavily armed and armored opponents, but he lends his strength to his comrades-in-arm in a fixed reenactment, turning a certain slaughter into a triumph. Not only does Maximus' sense of honor stop him from hailing an emperor who has none of his respect, but also makes him spare the life of a fallen opponent the entire Collusium wants him to end...until the moment he doesn't.

Harlan Ellison has written that it is never the common man who changes things, but the uncommon man. If Ridley Scott's sheer visual epic is anything, it is a celebration of that man, a man who still believes in ""Strength and honor"".",9
17 April 2001,"Very Entertaining, if Slightly Overrated, Epic","`Gladiator' is a splendid, action-packed throwback to sandal epics such as `Spartacus'. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a general in the Roman army. After crushing an army of Gauls, Maximus meets with the Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that he wishes Rome to become a Republic once more, after his death . . . and that he would like Maximus to help create this new Republic. Afterwards, Aurelius goes to see his spoiled son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and tells him that he does not feel Rome should have another Emperor. In a fit of rage, Commodus kills Aurelius and becomes emperor, and then promptly orders the execution of Maximus. Maximus manages to escape his own death . . . . but his wife and son, alas, do not. Fast forward a few years (exactly how the following transpires is never clear), and Maximus is a slave, a gladiator forced to kill in order to entertain the Roman people. As his popularity as a gladiator grows, Maximus begins to see how he can exact his vengeance upon Commodus.

For the most part, `Gladiator' is well-acted. Russell Crowe is quietly intense as the former general Maximus, and manages to effortlessly pull off a memorable performance in what could've been a wooden role in other hands. Richard Harris is good as the wise and weary Marcus Aurelius, and the late Oliver Reed is excellent in his final role as Proximo, the cunning gladiator trainer. The weak link of the cast is Joaquin Phoenix, who I still can't believe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his stiff, awkward portrayal of Commodus. I found him annoying instead of terrifying ¬ñ Commodus needed to be a fearful tyrant, and instead he was little more a petulant child. This might have been more how the role was written instead of Joachim Phoenix's acting skill, but the character of Commodus still brought the movie down. Ridley Scott's direction is superb ¬ñ the battle scenes and the gladiator fights are wonderfully done, and the movie has a grand, epic feel that's been missing from the big screen for far too long. The use of CGI to recreate Rome is incredible as well. Where the film falls apart to a certain extent is the story ¬ñ there are a few plot holes that are just big enough to be distracting. For example, the audience watching `Gladiator' in the theater or at home on their DVD player are given plenty of reasons to hate the vile Commodus . . . but it's never made clear why the Roman people would hate him. The Emperor puts on lots of gladiator tournaments, gives out free bread, free wine ¬ñ hey, the average Roman should love Commodus! So why isn't he? Little points like this drag `Gladiator' down slightly ¬ñ and while these detractions certainly don't make `Gladiator' a bad film, I think they're enough to pull it down off the masterpiece mantel. Personally, while I really liked `Gladiator', I think even nominating it for Best Picture of 2000 was a stretch, and as for actually winning the Best Picture Oscar . . . no. It's good, but not that good.

Still, an intense epic worth watching. A-",8

12 February 2015,"""It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live"" - Marcus Aurelius.","I watched this movie when I was studying in a middle school. I think around fourteen or fifteen years ago. It was one of the first movie that I have seen in a cinema. I was very impressed and excited of this movie. This movie shows us maybe not a realistic period in the Roman Empire but very close to it. The plot of this story and main characters does not confined or limited by historical books and myths. I think Ridley Scott has a unique and distinctive ability of creation movies that touches historical period. All characters interesting, have nuance and charm. I think it is one of the best movies with Russell Crowe. I liked this movie and I can watch this movie again and again, and I will not be bored. This movie does not have an expiration date and defiantly I could not classify this movie as ""One time to watch, in enough""... I think the ""Gladiator"" is one of the best movie that I have seen. I defiantly recommend to watch this movie for people who does not seen it yet.

4 November 2000,Welcome back Ridley Scott,"After a decade in the wilderness Scott has made a triumphant return with the exciting ""Gladiator"". I did, admittedly, take a while to get into this but once I got caught up in it I was swept along with the spectacle. Terrifically cast with good, charismatic actors the powerful acting raises this above the level of many recent blockbusters. The battle scenes are exciting and gory (and, interestingly enough, put us in the same position as the blood-thirsty audiences in the colisseum)and counterbalance the film's quieter moments successfully. The storyline is nothing new and there are no hidden depths, but, it is made with such panache that it is hard not to like. Special mention for the touching dedication to Ollie Reed-a real character who brought a bit of colour to our screens and gives a good final performance here.

20 December 2006,Boring and Over rated,"Okay maybe a 2 out of 10 is a bit harsh but it can make up for the ridiculous ratings of 10 out of 10. This movie was nothing new. It wasn't gripping, or interesting, or factual, it was just boring, I was waiting for it to get kicking all the time. I decided to watch it because of the high ratings and I remember quite enjoying Ben Herr and Spartacus but all this filmed seemed to be was lots of long beautifully filmed shots of the scenery. The fight scenes were good but didn't help make the film any more interesting. The acting was good, but didn't help make the plot any better. And overall I was just board and disappointed that i had wasted an evening watching that film.

20 August 2017,A lesson in film making,"Although it is primarily an action film and everything else comes to second place, it is a good one. Timing for instance in this movie is just impeccable. The whole works like a well oiled machine that once started stops upon nothing. The first barbarian battle scene is indicative of what is to follow. No doubt Mr. Ridley Scott wields absolute control upon his means like a real master.

18 June 2003,Acting,"Without exceptional acting and violence, this movie would have been the most boring movie I'd had to sit through. Crowe and Pheonix were great. Even though there were a lot of battle scenes, it took a lot of time for the battle scenes to come in. It wasn't as frequent as I thought it would. Between each battle there was a long pause of talking and talking. Over all, I thought the movie was ok and I guess recommend it.

4 August 2000,Cool and Epic,"The Basic plot: Maximus, a powerful general is loved by the aging Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appoints maximus to be the next emperor, but his jealous son Commodus murders his father so he can be emperor and keep Maximus off power. He then kills Maximus's family and sells maxi to Africa as a gladiator, where he is taken by Proximo to Rome,where he becomes popular and vows revenge on the corrupt Commodus.

The praise:Very well-made. The battle scenes are exciting ,outrageous , exotic and gloriously action-packed , and a feast for the eye. Actually the entire movie is a great eye feast ,with classic sets and cinematography. It also has great suspense ,deviously larger than life dialogue,plot and acting, all leading to a climax that will make you cry.Russel Crowe is an icon, brilliant in a good role, he, in his armor out on the battlefield, under the sun ,with the crowd cheering. A larger than life movie.

The flaws: A few slow sections along the way.

16 May 2000,You will either love or hate this movie. I loved it!,"That being said, I can honestly say to forget the 'reviews' from those who didn't even sit through the whole movie. That's just whack. But it really is the sort of show that some people just won't like. If you're a history purist, the story and characters just won't add up. But mostly I don't think the negative reviewers see the depth and get annoyed with the violence. The movie does have plenty of violence. But gore? I don't know what Mary Poppins spinoffs they've been feeding on, but there's a whole buncha movies out there that have more gore. Gladiator flashes the 'chop off the arm' or the 'split the skull' scene very quickly. You know it happened but barely see it.

There is much more to this movie than action or gore. All the main actors are good or better. I saw a touching scene here, a real feeling there. And hell, no movie and I mean no movie has ever before given viewers so much of ancient Rome to look at. What a great job of computer rendering!

For those who haven't been watching movies for 40 years, this is the same basic story that was the basis for the 'Fall of the Roman Empire', made in the 60's. Sophia Loren was Lucilla, Stephen Boyd as Maximus, Christopher Plummer as Commodus and Obi Wan Kenobi as Marcus Aurelius. Similar but different, I prefer Gladiator.",9
4 February 2001,Romans did it better,"the movie is a big, sometimes terrific, show located in a very hypothetical Roman Empire.

9 February 2001,Only Crowe was any good.,"Take a great actor (Russell Crowe), a thin, predictable plot, some one-dimensional characters (e.g. Commodus), a TERRIBLE musical score and throw in some computer-generated graphics, and you've got a Hollywood blockbuster. I guess it just goes to prove the old saying: no one ever lost money underestimating the taste of the American public.

25 May 2000,"Hey Joey, Do you like Gladiator movies?","Gladiator seemingly brings back the ""Epic"" film (although the true epics included thousands of extras and larger than life productions and with CGI none of that extravagance is necessary). Gladiator is by no means a great film. The plot is paper thin, the story lines moves from point A to B with unfaltering linearity, and the end battle is somewhat of a disappointment. With that said, however, Gladiator was incredible to watch, making the audience watch in amazement as bodies are sliced and diced in the gory arena battles. Russell Crowe is great (per usual) as Maximus, lending credibility to some of the more ridiculous dialogue and Joaquin Phoenix is superb (again per usual) as the tortured Commodus (unfortunate name). Y2K has not produced the great films of 1999 (American Beauty, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich) yet, but Gladiator is a nice try.

16 May 2000,Awesome!,"Wow! That's all I can say after watching ""Gladiator"". And you know what? I'm not writing this review immediately after watching the movie like I usually do. I'm writing this review after watching the movie for the SECOND time. Yep, I saw this movie on opening night and then went and saw it again two days later.

Gladiator is about a Roman General who's a hero that becomes a slave, then becomes a gladiator, and finally a hero again. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) refuses to support the young Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) as he suspects foul play after it is discovered that the current Emperor and father to Commodus is found dead. Maximus becomes an outcast and eventually a slave as he is bought by Proximo, a man who engages in the sport of gladiating by supplying the slaves that will eventually be killed in these gruesome competitions. To Proximo's surprise, Maximus not only survives competition after competition but he becomes the favorite in almost every competition. But there's more to this man's success than skill alone. There's revenge.

Russell Crowe is not one of the better-known actors but he's fast becoming one. I saw him in ""Insider"" and was blown away with his performance there but when I saw this movie I gained an even deeper respect for this man. He is one talented actor. The rest of the cast is no sack of potatoes either. This is probably one of the most talented group of actors assembled for one film.

Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Dereck Jacobi, the list goes on and it's hard to find a weak actor in the group. I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix. I thought he played the young Emperor with a wonderful mix of child-like poutiness and scheming villany that was a good counterpart to Crowe's character. Connie Nielsen's portrayal of Commodus's sister, Lucilla, was equally well done and at times made you feel a bit uncomfortable as the hint of an incestuous relationship between her and Commodus possibly existed.

The good thing about this movie was that there was a good storyline to backup the strong cast. The dialogue was appropriate to the story and unlike many of the other ""testosterone"" filled movies, this one didn't suffer the fate of cheezy lines.

Overall, a definite must see but I must warn you. There is a tremendous amount of graphic violence so if you're faint of heart this may not be the movie for you. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, you must go see it. For your information, the real Commodus did participate in gladiating and was rumored to have amassed a record of 1000 wins so he was no slouch in the gladiating ring.",10
13 April 2007,a masterpiece,"gladiator is a classic movie. it is a masterpiece. it is a film that one should not miss. talking about the movie the starting was very gripping that holds a viewer for rest of the movie. then the story of the movie unfolds at a good pace that is enough to maintain the interest of the viewer. when the hero returns to his home and sees his house in ruins those scenes were very touching. costumes are also very good. i think story of the movie was excellent. the direction was also good. the fight scenes in the fighting arena were breath taking. and in the end the ending was perfect.i also liked the background music of the film it goes with the mood of the film.

and at last the acting of all the actors specially Russell crowe was perfect which proved cherry on the cake.

17 July 2000,"I hated, hated, HATED this movie","I love ancient epics. Who doesn't? I grew up watching Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules"" TV series and was captivated by it, and I also enjoyed BEN-HUR and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. These films worked because they treated the civilizations of Greece and Rome with the utmost respect.

So when I first heard about Russell Crowe's new movie GLADIATOR I was on fire to see it. I couldn't wait to sit in the theater and watch Crowe battle tigers and armored monsters with swords.

But the movie left me cold, and in retrospect I should have expected as much. Director Ridley Scott (of BLADE RUNNER and the ALIEN films) projects his usual bleak palette on the screen here. For a movie about a glorious regime that supposedly brought light to what was then the known world, GLADIATOR seems so dark and gloomy. Plus, the story is anything but a whimsical joy ride; it's a bitter revenge-fest. After finding that his wife and son have been murdered, the Roman general Maximus (Crowe) is sold into slavery and becomes an angry, violent gladiator. The whole point of the plot is that he must find the man who wronged him - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the new emperor of Rome - and take his revenge.

I'm sorry, but I never knew anger and vengeance were such crucial elements in the Roman epic. As Maximus, Crowe broods and seethes throughout the entire production and manages to suck most of the fun out of the audience. Even the rousing gladiator battles (which took up less screen time than I'd hoped) did little to pique my interest. I tried to get myself to sympathize with Maximus, but I just couldn't. He didn't have a screen presence, unless you count hacking things to bits to be a presence.

I also loathed the film's villain, played by a pale, dark-eyed Joaquin Phoenix. Movie villains are supposed to enjoy their time on screen, but Commodus just whines and moans his way to an anticlimactic death no decent villain deserves. If you have a lackluster hero in a movie, you should at least try to make the villain interesting. Not so here. Commodus seems more like an annoying teenager than a ruler, and his only fascinating quirk is the supposed feelings of lust he has for his sister. Their ""sex scene"" together isn't really much of anything, doesn't go anywhere, and left me feeling nauseated and a bit creeped out.

With such insufferably insipid characters I was forced to concentrate on the film's only two positive qualities: the stunning vistas (they are grand) and the fight choreography. Unfortunately, there isn't enough action in this so-called action movie to really get excited about. The few fight scenes are shot with manic camera angles that would be more at home in a music video. And the ultimate battle scene at the end, which by definition should be the best of the bunch, quickly fizzles out like a wet firecracker.

Pointless, nasty, nihilistic, and overall the joke of its genre, GLADIATOR is grossly overrated. I desperately wanted to like this film, but it fell way below my expectations of what a historical drama should be.",
6 May 2000,Battle scenes were awesome! Rest of movie was average.,"Just as I've said above, when there was fighting on screen the movie was good. When there was no fighting the movie was average.

I really wanted this movie to be better than it was. I had high hopes for it.

I can only give this movie a 6 rating. It came close to a 7, but overall I can only give it a 6. Based on the IMD rating scale this movie did not achieve the mandatory 7 which makes a movie worthwhile for me to see. Came close though.

15 September 2000,Watchable... (and a little overrated),"Great actors, great set design, great effects - but unfortunately the plot is not one of those effects. It¬¥s to PREDICTABLE. Russell Crowes performance convinced me, but as Maximus wife and his son were killed, the story turned to a much to simple story of revenge. There are movies were you don¬¥t mind about that, but this is a Ridley Scott film. In his earlier works he has shown how to connect a brilliant story with great visual effects (e.g. Blade runner). I suppose, Scott wanted to make something like the ""Ben Hur"" of the 21st century, but it isn¬¥t. After all, a laudable try to revive this genre.

18 January 2019,The most poetic and superlative film to date.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
26 October 2000,The most overrated movie of the year.,"GLADIATOR is a movie that should have been great. Great cast, great director, great idea- so why is the movie so bad? Because of the screenplay, as well as other things. The screenplay contains some horrible dialogue that even great actors can't make sound plausible. The acting is inconsistent. You have Russell Crowe playing it as some huge epic, Joaquin Phoenix horribly overacting, Richard Harris underacting- and no one seems to be acting in the same movie with each other. Then, look at the special effects- Ridley Scott makes the entire screen dark and blurry so you can't tell how crappy his effects are. I can't believe the kind of raving reviews this film is getting- it's just plain bad.

As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
13 May 2000,The cinematic highlight of 2000,"In Gladiator, Ridley Scott has most probably fashioned devised the cinematic highlight of the year and revived the beloved genre of Biblical/Roman epics in hi-tech, '90's style. However, there is no Biblical references in this one and it is much darker than the classics (in particularly Spartacus) which it has been moulded around. Like those films it is truly spectacular (special effects are at their best when you can hardly notice them) and has perfect actors playing memorable actors. There are some truly touching scenes (especially the last one) and others are fast, furious and blood-wrenched. All in all, Gladiator is a hugely impressive film which brings an old genre back to life and gives it an added dimension. It will probably spawn a few imitators but this original will end up a classic.

22 May 2000,Fantastic swashbuckling revival of a forgotten genre,"GLADIATOR is simply one amazing film! As well as completely re-inventing an epic formula that made middle-of-the-century cinema so important, it has shown us a new brand of movie star in the incredible Russell Crowe.

Director Ridley Scott has pulled every stop in this story of a Roman general who is betrayed, condemned, the ultimately triumphs. The action scenes are blisteringly exciting, using SAVING PRIVATE RYAN-esque camera techniques, and you can't help being swept along by the sheer grandness of this epic. Scott's pacing of the film is impeccable, so when it's over you realise that you haven't looked at your watch once, or even realised you'd been sitting down!

So much praise has been given to Crowe for his performance, and I can only add to it. The same quality of performance is given by his screen-nemesis, Joaquim Phoenix, whose portrayal of a ruthless, yet terribly vulnerable leader must surely be Oscar material. The late Oliver Reed delivers the kind of performance that makes us forget his last years and remember him for the great actor he once was. There is also a stirring musical score from the unstoppable talent of Hans Zimmer.

This film must surely be the cinematic event of this year - and it will make one hell of a DVD! Meanwhile, I'm off to see it again!",

26 January 2014,What we do in life... echoes in eternity,"Maxiumus is a power Roman general within the Roman legion. After having been betrayed and his family murdered by the new Roman emperor, Maxiumus vows vengeance that will achieve by any cost, and must do so as a Roman gladiator.

One of the finest films of its generation and one in which made Russell Crowe a star. Brilliantly acted and directed with awe inspiring action sequences with weight behind them. The viewer will feel for Crowe's plight within this film, as the pacing and story are top notch. The set pieces as well as the wardrobe and mentality of the film are extremely Roman and feel authentic as anything real in this modern age. A film that was nominated and one in which will not only grip the viewer from beginning to end but resonate with the viewer for some time to come. The action sequence are authentic and very tense as is intended. The musical score is heroic and filled with epic grandeur that only further strengthen the film. Many consider this film an epic and one in which still to this day hold up to the test of time. This film as well was Oliver Reed's last film as he passed away during the filming process. Gladiator is an awe inspiring, swords and sandals film that hold back no punches in its action, its pacing or its storytelling. The plot is rich, the storytelling grand and overall one of the finest films to ever have been made within the genre",9

12 May 2000,George Lucas take note,"Marvelously directed and spectacularly shot, ""Gladiator"" is an aural and visual feast from beginning to end. But it's more than that. It's a powerfully moving story which, despite the 154 minute running time, is economically written and very simply told. I've seen it three times and it just keeps getting better.

George Lucas should see this film about three hundred times before he shoots the first frame of ""Episode 2"". ""Gladiator"" is everything his disastrous ""Episode 1"" should have been: a great political story with lots of sword play, that still manages to be big on family values and which, most importantly, uses special effects FOR A NARRATIVE PURPOSE and not for their own sake. From the extraordinary opening battle sequence, to the spectacular recreations of Rome - and what looks suspiciously like a digitally-resurrected Oliver Reed in one or two shots - Ridley Scott deploys the special effects with sensitivity, purpose and elan. He uses them to TELL the story. With Lucas, they ARE the story.

If I were Lucas I'd be handing over the ""Episode 2"" writing duties to Messrs Franzoni, Logan and Nicholson, and only keeping the director's chair warm until Mr Scott wraps on ""Hannibal"".

Welcome back, Ridley. You're a master.",9
8 May 2001,Best Movie!!?? Gimmie a break!,"I can't say that I was really surprised when this movie won best picture. Hollywood long ago stopped awarding films that have any merit and only award films that make them money. Even saying that, to give this insipid junk any kind of recognition proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the academy awards are a pathetic farce. As far as battle scenes go, they weren't bad, but the rest of the film is a total bore, did the writers really think they were being clever by naming the title character Maximus!!?? Wow! How clever! Skip this movie. It stinks.

14 November 2003,WELL PUT TOGETHER,"Rusell Crowe might shine in this masterpiece but it's not entirely down to him.

Gladiator surges along due to precise purposeful directing,powerful scripting, adept casting and a host of filmmaking factors. Russell simply shines because that's what he has to do.

All said his Maximus is one of the most, vibrant figures in film-making history along side Gables' ""Rhett Butler"", Yul Bryners'""The King Of Siam"", Sidney Poitier's ""Sir"" in To Sir With Love and Morgan Freemans' ""Red"" in The Shawshank Redemption.

The trials and rise of Maximus and burning quest ultimately lead along a path to glory but his calm burning desire for vengeance sets aside from your pathological killer. He is a man wronged for no reason and the lives that were taken from must be repaid.

18 June 2005,Gladiator,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

1 May 2014,Timeless Modern Classic,"Who said that epic movies were out of vogue in 2000? Whoever had that thought was proved wrong by the modern reincarnation of a stereotypical sword-and-sandal motion picture called Gladiator. Gladiator has all the right elements of a big-screen epic, which certainly made the movie worthy of mass appeal around the world when it was released in the summer of 2000.

The storyline is filled with well interwoven subtle eternal themes that make the movie a compelling classic for generations to come. Even though some may perceive some of the scenes as grotesque and barbaric, the movie presents a well-balanced view of life in Roman times. It is certainly entertaining, artistic and thoughtful in its own way.

With an outstanding cast of actors, Gladiator has shown to the world that great movies can still be made when enough attention is given to every single detail of production. Certainly the movie was a success because of its script and seasoned and measured acting performances. It was also Oliver Reed's farewell performance, which fully encompassed his abilities as an actor. Perhaps it was pure fate that the casting director and production team chose him for the role. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine someone else playing his role.

This is certainly a movie that must be seen on the big screen uninterruptedly. And once you have seen it, please grab a history book and learn few more things about the ancestral heritage of the Roman empire.",8
22 April 2001,Great film! Read this and then see it!,"Gladiator, I thought, was an excellent movie in abundant ways. It was not only visually stunning, but the characters and the feel of the movie made you actually feel as if you were really there. I gave this a ten, and (if you haven't yet) once you've seen it you will too. I will admit that it is wildly graphic, but I like how it really gives meaning to the word ""combat."" The movie (to sum it up) is about a general named Maximus. This is in ancient Greece/Rome. ""Ceasar"" (not the (italic) Ceasar, but...) knows his life is ending but wants to crown Maximus Ceasar, instead of his (I think I will be...) son. His son then overthrows his dad and becomes Ceasar. He orders Maximus to be killed, but instead Maximus gets away, becomes a slave, is bought, becomes a very good Gladiator, and that's the movie (kinda). See it!

12 May 2000,When In Rome...,"The tag line for this film is `A Hero Will Rise.' Ain't that the truth. Make no mistake, Dreamworks' promotion for Gladiator has the principle purpose of launching this guy to the top of the Hollywood A-list. `Can we get Russell Crowe?' will soon be the number one question asked in production offices across Tinseltown. Looks like filmmakers have finally found a performer who is the Real Deal as it were. I mean, the intensity of his performances evoke true toughness: you feel like you'd trust the guy with your life. Can you now or could you ever say that about Costner? Cage? Keanu? Arnold? Crowe is here to stay and puts the hero back into movie heroics.

His new film is another good story in the vein of ""Braveheart""-not a bad blueprint to follow. The reservations I have about ""Gladiator"" all come from the familiarity of some of the scenes. The whole ¬ëhero of the people' thing it's got going; the retelling of the ages-old story of the struggle against totalitarianism. Here is another one, a good one, set in a time and place we haven't seen depicted in cinema for quite some time. The film uses its height-of-the-Roman Empire setting well and delivers on the promise of action and adventure. Set in the last days of the good Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the film takes on the familiar subject of a World Power worrying a little too much about its neighbors and not tending to its own growing problems at home.

In the opening scene, Marcus watches his powerful Roman army, led by his general and respected friend Maximus (Crowe), tear into a rebelling army of Germanic barbarians. This opening scene is a huge, loud, impressive spectacle that the movie never really tops. The Emperor would like to pass along rule of the Empire to Maximus, which comes as disturbing news to Marcus' disgraceful son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus sees to it that his father's dying wish is not carried out, and promptly orders Maximus executed. From here on, bad things happen to Maximus and to Rome, with the evil nervous wreck Commodus behind it all.

Maximus, thought dead by the new Emperor, is sold into slavery and trained to fight in the ¬ëgladiator' games, the entertainment choice of the times until they were abolished by Marcus Aurelius. Commodus, however, brings the games back. In the past, gladiators who could win over the crowds in the Colosseum would earn their freedom. Maximus has something else to fight for-revenge. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Thelma and Louise,"" ""G.I. Jane"") stages the arena scenes with pure entertainment in mind, just as the real things were. The whole idea of the games was to re-enact in a way, great wars fought and won by Rome. So here is Maximus, as a gladiator, pretending to be a soldier in an army he had likely conquered as a general in real life. This is when Maximus' character really gets under our skin. A lesser person might wallow in the obvious humiliation of his situation, but Maximus doesn't. He finds every opportunity to use it for the benefit of himself and his estranged countrymen. The story is so strong that these arena scenes become simply pieces of the whole that help to propel things forward. Scott never succumbs to the temptation of showing any more brutality than is necessary.

Joaquin Phoenix creates a truly loathsome human being in Commodus. This is the kind of twitchy, insecure kid a father would keep his daughter miles away from and here he is in charge of the world's greatest empire. The casting of Phoenix; along with Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Oliver Reed, and of course Crowe, shows that Gladiator's creators preferred substance over style.

The casting, the photography, the writing-all of these things seem to have been given great care. The result is what will probably end up being one of the year's best films.

Grade: B",9

26 June 2000,"Excellent story, vivid characters, awesome fight scenes","""Gladiator"" is one of those truly memorable films. The story is harrowing, the bad guys are truly evil, and the heroes are heroic. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a former general in the Roman Army, and a favorite of the late emperor, Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son, Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix), and heir to the throne, that he will not be choosing him as his successor, but Maximus, Commodus kills Aurelius and has Maximus sentenced to die. Commodus rises to power and has Maximus's family condemned to die as well. Maximus escapes his executioners and heads to his home in Spain to save his family. The Romans get there first, though, and Maximus's family is crucified. Maximus collapses at their graves and is taken prisoner by a slave trader. The slave trader sells him to an entertainer, who has Maximus trained as a gladiator. Maximus is incredible in the ring, and is taken to Rome to fight in the just re-opened Coliseum. I can't tell you any more without spoiling the story, though. The acting is excellent, and the viewer really begins to hate Commodus by the end of the film, and love and admire Maximus. The cinematography is good as well, with vivid colors and breathtaking shots. This is truly a great fight movie.",10

The film's action sequences are particularly noteworthy, with intense and well-choreographed battles that brought the historical setting to life. The film's themes of honor, courage, and revenge are woven seamlessly into the narrative, making for a moving and emotionally charged experience which us why I've rated Gladiator a 9/10.

10 July 2001,Hopelessly Overrated,"I cannot believe this picture won the Best Picture Oscar. Now I am completely convinced that the OSCAR is given for political/economic reasons than artistic/merit reasons.

The film does a poor job of telling a dumb story. Yeah a slave gladiator takes over the greatest empire on earth by Killing Caesar in a duel front of spectators. How likely is that? The film tries its best to try to convince that it is plausible, but that's what makes this film hilariously bad.

The fighting scenes were poorly choreographed. The Tigers lounges out, it seems, only when the director wants them to, not when the gladiator should be trounced by it.

The special effects in this movie were not special. In fact, it has ALL been done before much BETTER in other films. What is so spectacular about developing a virtual colisum when we can create a virtual dinosaurs, cities, creatures, etc etc???",3
14 May 2000,A welcome return to the epic blockbuster,"""Gladiator"" is a true tour-de-force, a satisfying, thrilling eipc that makes moviegoing fun again. I place it on a level with ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus.""

The cinematography, sound and editing (though I have a few minor complaints with the latter) were superb. The story was engrossing and the performances were first rate.

Russell Crowe is solid as the heroic Roman general who suffers at the hand of Commodus, the ambitious and ruthless emperor's son (Joaquin Pheonix). Richard Harris has a wonderful turn as the dying emperor who loves Maximus as his own. The late Oliver Reed is perfect as the slaver ""businessman."" But the one performance that may be overlooked in this rich masterpiece is that of Connie Nielsen as the emperor's daughter, Lucilla. Nielsen's use of expressions as well as words to convey her character's moods is excellent.

Some of the violence, though necessary, may be hard to take for the squeamish, but I thought it was not overdone, as is the case in lesser movies with violent themes.

All in all, ""Gladiator"" is an instant classic, a movie long overdue and one I recommend highly.",10
12 June 2000,It gets the adrenaline going...,"Russell Crowe, now that name sounded vaguely familiar to me. Yeah, he played in a little movie called ""Virtuosity"" with co-star Denzel Washington back in 1995. Now this movie didn't earn very much recognition, but I'm sure Gladiator will. The movie had me hooked from the beginning with the battle between the Romans and Barbarians. The panoramic shot of the battle was breathtaking. Russell Crowe delivers one heck of a performance, as one would say ""whoa"". I heard myself muttering that word over and over again. The battles are very well done and flow with smooth perfection. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it was definitely fitting, nonetheless. This movie is a must-see, for movie fans of all genres. Gladiator delivers a bit of everything. Perfect 10.

27 April 2020,Amazing Period Piece,"Gladiator is probably my favourite movie ever - if not, it's my favourite period piece without a doubt.

I love anything to do with ancient Rome. This movie, although not entirely historically accurate (nor is it meant to be - but it still is realistic), really draws you in with it's sets, colour palette, and storyline.

Connie Nielson does an incredible performance. Russell Crowe + Joaquin Phoenix have a compelling energy in their scenes together, but also individually throughout the movie.

Overall, 10/10 for me

8 April 2001,"Worst ""Best Picture Oscar"" since ""The Last Emporer""","This movie is just such a mess, that last year must have been a worse year for movies than I'd realized. That said, Traffic is head and shoulders in quality beyond this silly toga movie.

There are little scenes in this movie that do not relate to ANYTHING - most notably, the scene near the end where someone puts a poisonous snake in a bed. The viewers are lead to believe that a certain traitor was being killed; the set-up about Cleopatra had been made in the previous scene. But nothing happens - the character is clearly alive later.

The scenes involving war crib from the best - Rashoman and Henry V, with music stolen from Holsts' The Planets. The gladiator scenes steal from Spartacus (with more gore, of course; Spartacus, made over 40 years ago, is a vastly superior movie despite Tony Curtis' problems with acting). The Collesium scenes use many shots from Ben Hur.

The performances are all over the place. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (whose ruminations on death in the movie are all the more eerie since he died during the filming) are terrific. Russell Crowe is pretty good, but not great. His best scenes are during his general days early in the movie. But Juanquin Phoenix and, to a degree, Connie Nielsen feel like they are in a completely different movie.

Some of the photography and most of the CGI work (except when they attempted to animate a tiger) is quite good. The animated tigers intercut with real tigers showed the CGI isn't perfect because the perspective is extremely flat when the animated tigers are used.

This movie is an ambitious disappointment. It is very much like Ben Hur in that it has flashes of brilliance but is undercut by a surprisingly awkward script. On the whole, I'll take Ben Hur and Spartacus for great cinema about Rome.",6
15 October 2021,A personal favorite,"Maximus is a great character and Crowe is fantastic in it. Intense battle and and some scenes have so much tension you could cut it with a knife. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus seems terrifyingly real. A great protagonist and antagonist combines for a must watch film.

2 April 2001,Hollywood Did It Again: Big-Budget Movie Won Oscar!,"This movie is good, to a certain extent. The setting is grand and the fighting scenes are nice, but the storyline is highly predictable and the ending doesn't really make sense!

The actings are not that good for both actors to be nominated for Oscar, but Russell Crowe actually got away with Best Actor award! Not to mention Joaquin Phoenix's bad acting that surprisingly earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination...

This is not a bad movie, but not a fantastic one either. It won Best Picture awards partly just because it's a grand big-budget Hollywood studio movie, and partly because there were not enough good movies to compete with.

17 July 2011,Well crafted if not historically accurate,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7
7 May 2003,The best movie of 2000.,"This was definitely the best movie of 2000. It was everything you could possibly want from an epic adventure!

The story is about a man, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) who has been betrayed by the new Emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whose family was killed and turned from a General of the Roman Empire to a Gladiator; and now seeks for revenge.

The plot is outstanding, it is very well written, and it has a lot of historical background. Even though is not 100% accurate, it is excellent. The performances were good as well, Russel Crowe did deserve the Oscar for this movie, he made us be on the brink of our seat the whole movie. Joaquin Phoenix was equally good as Commodus, his performance is so convincing that you actually end up hating him. All the rest of the cast were equally good, most of all Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.

The music of this movie is possibly one of the most important parts of it, it is perfect in every single situation. The special effects were outstanding, we get to see the glory of Rome back in those days.

This movie is a must see, however; if you are looking for a movie based 100% in history facts, watch the History Channel instead. If you want to have a great time, watch this movie. ***** out of *****",8
18 June 2000,This is no Braveheart/Titanic!!!,"Why oh why, have soooo many people compared this wonderful movie with 'Braveheart' or 'Titanic', I do not know. Stop comparing it to two films which are so completely different, and just enjoy the film!!!! Sorry, but I just had to get that off my chest. I'm going to see 'Gladiator' again next week cos I love it so much. -Yeah, yeah, I know, it's more of 'a guy' movie, but I think it's GREAT!

6 June 2000,Great Scott!,"After weeks of waiting and waiting to see this movie, I finally got round to seeing 'Gladiator' this afternoon. I'd read a lot of reviews praising it, and I've always liked Ridley Scotts' work. Here he proves again what a brilliant director he is. 'Gladiator' has got to be the best Roman epic since....well, 'Ben Hur'. Russell Crowe is not a name I'd heard of till seeing this film, but I expect we'll be hearing a lot more of him after this. He is simply superb. He has a good mixture of toughness and emotion in it to make you sympathise with him, and will him on. Joaquin Phoenix's bad guy emperor is a brilliantly nasty, and probably a bit mad character, who you want to see get punished. Well, everyone is brilliant, lets face it, cos it *is* a Ridley Scott movie, and he always casts well. All in all, brilliant. 9/10

15 October 2000,Glad I saw it...,"What good is one man to an empire like the Roman Empire. Why should one man be important?

The Gladiator answers these questions fairly. With beautiful scope masterfully done by veteran director Ridley Scott, Gladiator forces us into the broken life of Maximus, played very well by Russell Crowe. A commander of the Roman Armies and a surrogate son to a dying Roman Emperor, Maximus just wants to return home. He has seen too much of war.

In his humility, he declines his dying Emperor's wishes for him to take the throne, and leaves the boon to the Emperor's spoiled rotten son, Commodus (of which Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour-de-force performance.)

Because of his jealousy over his father's love, Commodus is sick with envy over Maximus's importance. In his ignorance, he makes Maximus the main attraction of his new Collusium in Rome, where the warrior, now gladiator, must face death and thrill the crowds -- in turn, making him to be a legend beyond his own Imperial name.

With fine acting, a wonderful screenplay and excitement galore, this movie captivates.",9

20 February 2001,"No problems here, just dont ask for Saving Private Ryan","This is a true epic, it's likenesses to Braveheart are forgivable since there are even more quite obvious avoidances to likening it to Braveheart, it's as though the movie skates the path in a field of nails. Russel's role is not as demanding as the one he should have won for, 99's the Insider but there is nothing lacking in his or anyone else's performance. What exactly do you look to rate a film by, Production values, Originality, Acting, Dramatic Quality, Meaning, it scores a 10 in all but all of these. The special effects are not to be faulted, grandeuresce is the word, seemless shots like the depiction of Oliver Reed who passed away during production, you cant pick what is real or what is not. The tigers can only be seen as real, I knew after seeing and reading a review that they were digital. The directing is seemless and the battle scene cinematography seems presented as part of the depiction, too many over-army shots would have you thinking ""Braveheart."" It is the most deservant for Best Picture, and with exactly the same noms that Ben-Hur was met with I cant see whay it should'nt win most of the others. As already stated, this is desrvant of the title epic, see it.

31 March 2003,The best epic movie in our times,"The best movie in the year 2000 was the Gladiator, which was directed by R. Scott and written by D. Franzoni. The main actor is Russell Crowe.

The film was set in Ancient Rome . One of the characters is Maximus Decimus Meridius, loyal servant of the Emperor of Rome Marco Aurelius, who is betrayed by the Emperor's corrupted son the prince. When his family is murdered and he escaped death,he returned to Rome to seek revenge as a gladiator.

I enjoyed the film because, in my opinion, all the parts of the movie were wonderfully performed and directed. The costunes are according to when and where the story takes place. Another important aspect is the scenery that is surprising, for example when the Gladiator has to fight against the Prince in the majestic Colleseum.

I don't recommend this movie, I simply tell you: ""You MUST see this film!"" I you don't, you will miss the best epic story of the last years.

10 February 2004,"""I'm Brian, and so's my wife,"" OR ""What have the Romans ever done for us?""","We saw this in a local flea - pit and sat in front of an old guy who gave a running commentary to his friend all the way through (""Look at the size of that spear, etc.""). Luckily it only served to enhance our enjoyment, rather than detract from it, providing a certain comedy element that was otherwise lacking.

If you've seen Ben Hur, Spartacus and Braveheart then you've already seen Gladiator (not forgetting Life of Brian, which features one of the most memorable gladiator scenes in movie history). The action scenes are fairly entertaining, but not to be recommended to those of a squeamish disposition. The main character, Naughtius Maximus or something, is supposed to be Spanish, but sounds remarkably Australian throughout the film.

It's nice to see Oliver Reed back in action, reminding us that he used to be famous for more than appearing drunk on chat shows. However, for those of you that are unaware, he sadly passed away before the film was completed, calling for several rewrites and some technical jiggereypokery. Possibly the film does suffer as a result, as you get the feeling that some elements of the last act were stuck on with blu-tak.

However, I did actually enjoy a lot of Gladiator, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the cowardly emperor who's desire for power (and his sister) gets a little out of hand. For those of you who like your action loud, brutal and featuring men in skirts I highly recommend this movie.",
29 March 2001,Sic Semper Blockbusterus Summerus,"Despite getting off to a shaky start with that jarring, slightly confusing battle sequence with the barbarian horde I really enjoyed this movie. Did it deserve to win Best Picture? No. I thought it was entertaining in much the same way, say ""The Great Escape"" or ""Fist of Legend"" was; it's escapism at it's best, but it's not Oscar Gold. But then again, 2000 was a very dry year for movies...

Russell Crowe was excellent. So was Oliver Reed. It was sad to note that his performance went largely unnoticed in most reviews in favor of Joaquin Phoenix's (who was good, but still...). And the soundtrack was simply stunning.

A good yet highly overrated movie.

11 July 2001,I Don't Get It,"What a dud of a movie!

Don't get me wrong. This movie had some amazing scenes, but I didn't think Russell Crowe's performance was anything spectacular (he was much better in ""The Insider"", and should've won best actor for that, but that's another story.)

The story was too predictable. We've seen this epic type movie many times over, and quite frankly, it's hard to come up with new material...I understand that. But to totally rip off scenes from it's predecesors...what's up with that?

I guess this movie just ranks up there with all of the other over-hyped movies (Titanic, There's Something About Mary, ANYTHING starring Julia Roberts!)

To be honest, I thought that Gladiator was almost boring. There was not enough action to keep the movie rolling.

As for Best Picture? I know that the Academy loves the epic, but there were a few movies in 2000 that deserved the awards more than Gladiator. (Almost Famous, Traffic, Crouching Tiger...)

Overall, I guess I just expected more from this movie. I guess I just have friends who hype movies too much. Maybe I should tell them to shut up.",4
17 September 2006,performances and spectacle spoiled by story contrivances,"The performances and spectacle of this film make it worth watching, and the opening battle scene offered hope that the film would be outstanding. From several standpoints, the film was disappointing at best. Much of the gore was gratuitous, including an especially bloody scene (the first gladiator combat) in which all physical laws are transcended. The gladiator scene involving tigers was beyond belief. The story content left any viewer completely baffled. Why the writers felt it was necessary to concoct an impossible ending is difficult to understand. The real story was much more interesting, and no contrivances were necessary.

30 September 2022,Rome,"Listen. This movie is not a history lesson. Movies are seldom that. What it is, is a dramatic representation of the essence of Rome as we understand it, and need to understand it, in order to understand ourselves as citizens of the western world and therefore, heirs of the roman heritage. I grew up with this movie, and whatever may happen to me, the truth of this movie will always stay with me. That is the profound way it has shaped me. It is mythical in this way. Every scene, every line, every note of the score is always with me. What we do in life, echoes in eternity, is tatooed on my arm, as a constant inspiration to be more than what the world around me may think me capable of.

24 October 2003,a terrible waste of two and a half hours of your life,"Gladiator is an epic movie - it is the most breathtakingly awful fiasco of a film made for many years.

Watch the battle scenes besides other popular movies, like Lord of the Rings, and the direction looks terrible. Watch them alongside Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and it soon becomes apparent that if you deposited two cameras in a cage full of monkeys, they would make a better artistic job of filmaking than Ridley Scott. The actors are uniformly awful, the CGI effects are overused and unconvincing, the script is turgid and the political message of the whole thing is deeply confused. While the historical inaccuracy of the notion that the Romans had a deep affective investment in domestic ideology is amusing for two minutes, the sheer hackneyed conventionality of it soon becomes direly boring. Most offensive of all, however, is its political charlatanism. Gladiator pretends to be advocating radical republican democracy (think Rousseau), but in fact uses classical republicanism as a screen to peddle the same modern right wing liberal message as every other forgettable American B-movie.

The only way the acclaim it has received can be explained is by recourse to the near illiteracy and general ignorance of its ""fans"".

Basically, if you know anything about art, you will hate this film. If you understand 'cool' you will detest it. If you are an uneducated male, who is slightly insecure about his masculinity, or a brainless Crowe worshipper stuck in a teenage lifestyle with nothing better to spend your time on than dusting your collection of his posters, you will probably adore it.",1
13 June 2023,Roman Epic Thats Hard to Dislike,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8
2 March 2002,A solid Best Picture,"For all of the awards and money that went to this movie, this movie is still not regarded very highly by the online movie community (usenet groups etc..).

There are several reasons for this. One is that it was in contention for Best Picture against some extremely well made movies : ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ; ""Traffic"". These are some really incredible movies as well. All three of the movies are deserving of the Best Picture Award. The two losing movies have since become cult classics in their own right, with a very strong following.

Another reason that some have played it down is because it SO many Awards. The one that seemed to bother people the most was Russell Crowe's Best Actor Award. Many felt his role was simply physical, and not too difficult to portray.

These are valid points in their own right. However, I have viewed ""Gladiator"" many times on cable. It is practically on every other day. With these viewings, I have noticed that the film has a great amount of staying power. There are many great performances in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is his best without a doubt.

So many other elements (which it of course won awards for) will suck you into this movie again and again. I was never a fan of ""Gladiator"". Frankly, I liked ""Traffic"" better. However, I still find myself watching it when it is on - and every time I watch it there is something new that I like.

I believe in 5-10 years many people who believe ""Gladiator"" didn't deserve all of the awards it garnished will also realize that you have to view ""Gladiator"" for what it is : a gigantic epic with an enormous amount of elements to be appreciated after many viewings.",7
13 May 2000,Historical? No. Epic? Sure.,"Let's just get the negatives out of the way first. 1) This is not historically accurate. I could bore you all with the details, but I won't. Let's just say that the last fifteen minutes of the movie were purely fantasy, while the rest might be written off as a...dream-version of history. Ahem.

2) The music was awful. This is not Xena. Please don't subject my eardrums to the atonal wailings of some middle-eastern woman. It wasn't appropriate to have synthesizers when you've got someone like Basil Poledouris who could've scored this masterfully with *real* instruments!

Okay, onto the good stuff. I'll skip comments on acting and whatnot--it was good and bad, you decide. But I will say this: the political themes presented in the movie are entirely topical to 20th century America. Demagoguery hasn't ever been more rampant--listen to Gracchus, people. He knows of which he speaks:) Secondly, watch for the comments on the folks who ogle men about to kill each other, and about the idea of bloodsport in general. Then, look around yourself in the theater, and ask, ""How many people are here just to see a man and tiger try to kill each other? Or to see the 'big battle scene' with all of its violence?"" Then wonder where the comments are actually being directed: at the audience of the Colosseum, or of the Googolplex Cinema you're in.

Enjoy!",4

4 December 2000,"Long, technically poor, would be epic.","I know it's useless complaining about inaccuracies in these historical movies, nobody really cares and if the end results are entertaining all is forgiven. Let's just say, as many others have pointed out, in battles Roman legions just did not fight as depicted here.

Technically the movie is poor. Ridley Scott has used his old trick of using muted colors and shooting in murky light to cover the fact that the effects are not very good. It worked in BLADE RUNNER but here it doesn't work at all, and the computerized scenes are very obvious.

As always seems to be the case in these historical films the British and Irish garner the acting honors. Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are fine in their roles but Joaquin Phoenix doesn't register in his at all. Connie Nielsen is attractive but doesn't have too much to do.

I have never been able to understand the appeal of Russell Crowe. I find his acting range very limited and with his squat physique, pudgy face and shifty eyes he hardly suggests an heroic figure. Useless to say any of that to women however they just do their (smiling slightly) routine. It must be his muscles and deep voice.

Some blood and gore in the arena scenes for those that like that sort of thing and no doubt the movie will do a blockbuster rental business but I found it all rather a bore.",
17 June 2000,Great epic not dwarfed by the effects,"I went into this movie expecting it to be nothing but guts and gore and lots of screaming. Boy, was I wrong! Yes, there was some of all those things, but what also came off the screen was an absorbing story of a man's determination to bring his life full circle -- make it complete by avenging those who had wronged him. The computer generated effects were far above those of TITANIC and the work done in the battle scenes was simply awe-inspiring. I had a few quibbles: the relationship between Drucilla and Maximus prior to the opening of the movie was not explained and the speed of the opening battle varied from slow to fast and it was hard to keep an eye on any one person. Very minor things! I spent $4.75 to see the movie and it was WELL WORTH IT! I think I've recovered from the belly flop that was TITANIC. I can now go to a theatre and spend my money with confidence. There ARE good movies out there!

23 March 2009,Gladiator nearly killed by writing,"Everything's better now. The acting, the photography, the sound, the editing, the costumes (Roman indigo too, not purple), the effects and the art design. The action sequences, the location work. OK, there are some anachronisms and the history is fictionalized, and the stunts were impressive in the 1920s too. Still, everything's better now. Except the writing.

If Charlton Heston, Yul Brinner, and Anne Baxter were reading this film's dialogue you would hear how dreadful it really is. It's a tribute to modern actors like Crowe and Phoenix that they can make even things like ""I shall have my vengeance-- in this life or the next!"" sound as if someone might say them, somewhere, ever. Try it! This fight between quality actor and poor script is fought out within nearly every contemporary Hollywood blockbuster. Why? How much does a joke cost? Do audiences accept this as good writing? Why don't they demand better? To prove all this: watch the DVD with the sound off and the subtitles on. Yes, that's how hard Crowe and the rest had to work. THis movie deserves a 6 (a 9 with a -3 for the writing), but it gets an 8 because the actors are able to put the banalities over and make it sound convincing.",8
26 May 2000,"Excellent fight scenes, boring storyline","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul.

The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap.

14 May 2000,Genre revisited but (hopefully) not revived,"When I first started going to the cinema some 40 years ago, the sword-and-sandal saga was a staple part of the repertoire. Many of the films came from Italy and starred the ubiquitous former Mr Universe Steve Reeves who ironically died a few days before the opening in Britain of `Gladiator'. Easily the best of these epics was `Spartacus' (1960), but I had thought this type of film long dead before the talented and resourceful Ridley Scott ¬ñ director of such magnificent work as `Alien', `Blade Runner' and `Thelma And Louise' ¬ñ decided to revisit (but surely not revive) the genre. The plotting and values of `Gladiator' are decidedly old-fashioned, but the skill and technology deployed to bring it to the screen are state-of-the-art.

The basic storyline is thoroughly familiar to anyone who has seen `The Fall Of The Roman Empire' (1964): following the death of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 180, a noble soldier seeks to restore the glory that was Rome in the face of the corruption and brutality fostered by the new, young emperor Commodus. But, whereas `Fall' was very slow and stilted, from the opening battle scene in Germania to the closing combat in the Colosseum, `Gladiator' is simply thrilling. Above all, this is a tribute to Scott who is a consummate film-maker: the photography, the cutting, the sound, the music are all brilliant. Having twice visited the ruins of the Colosseum, I had wondered what it looked like originally and know I believe I know as a result of Scott's computer-generated recreation of the mighty edifice and its visceral exhibition of violence.

Yet the director is well-served by his stable of actors. New Zealander Russell Crow, who first came to the fore in `L.A. Confidential', is inspiring as Maximus, a hero as honourable and laconic as he is brave and resourceful. Plato would have been proud of him, since he believed that the only man fit to rule was one who did not want to do so. Joaquin Phoenix has a deeply unsympathetic role as Commodus but brings immense depth to the evil part. Among the other performers are an unusually venerable Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, Derek Jacobi who was so magnificent in the British television series `I, Claudius', and Oliver Reed who drank himself to death during the filming in Malta.",
16 May 2000,I walked out and didn't regret it,"I sat through about 30 minutes of depressing, gray, bloody opening battle scenes with ridiculous dialogue. I felt sorry for the actors, who were obviously better than the material and were doing their best. I ended up leaving my husband in his seat and ducking into another theatre to see the end of Return to Me, which I'd seen previously and enjoyed. I went back in 90 minutes, thinking my husband would be waiting impatiently, only to find that the movie was still going. I sat through about 10 more minutes before I realized that I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in what had happened to the characters in the interim to get them to that point. So I left again, and walked to a nearby bookstore to wait through the remaining 20 minutes. Maybe I am not qualified to review this movie since I didn't even see half of it, but the fact that I never walk out of movies--this was only the second in 25 years--should say something. And I walked out of this one TWICE.

12 September 2013,Oliver Reed as Generational Actor,"I was wondering how to arrange my train of thoughts about actor Oliver Reed.""Gladiator"" (2000) was his last film and though sacrifice should be made not to speak for the movie itself, I still insist of paying tribute to the Actor with this shot which sent him to grave just like many other times he was binging and filming. I read his authorized biography from Virgin Books and was amazed at his extraordinary practices to absorb industrial amounts of alcohol at no costs to his health. I myself can not afford this habit any more though sometime we used to drink and party a lot. I also brood on the fact how people change with age and their zeal for life also.

By calling Oliver Reed generational actor I mean the following. These actors appear on the big screen as stars once in a decade, usually in tuples, brought as product by great nations or at least big enough to form a pool. Thus France gave to the cinema in the 60s and 70s Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Unscathingly, here in this movie Reed is paired with Richard Harris - in the role of Emperor Marcus Aurelius - who also happens to be manifesto actor that together with the titular and couple of more fellows created the image of British adventure cinema for 20 years. At least thus appears to me as compared British to American born film stars. So we are talking here about weightlifters to be more precise.

Now I want to link the persona of Oliver Reed to a former Bulgarian buff called Kliment Denchev (d. 2009) - an immigrant to Canada from the 1980s. I remember that corpulent man for several reasons not the least that he had physical resemblance to Oliver which I put two-and-two together recently. That Kliment Denchev left Bulgaria for political reasons few people in that former communist country would remember or are willing to. What I recently read about his case was that he deliberately got shunned by the State Security organs and forced to live abroad with his wife as fugitive. I remember this giant of a man from his performances in the 1970s when he was leading in the children's nightly at 19.45 PM two times a week. He also participated in many Bulgarian cult films before he left for overseas.

Returning back to Oliver Reed. I shouldn't indulge anyone reading my preferences for him; he had enough fame and many critics. Women also loved him and I want to give a separate estimate for three of his films where he treated the opposite sex in his particular way:

1. Trap (1966) - Rita Tushingham, whom I took mistakenly for Geraldine Chaplin, plays a mute that is bought by fur trapper to attend. But they are stalked by Indians in the remote cabin and Oliver loses his leg in a wolf-trap by accident. The young girl finally understands what hard life means and returns to his lame master;

2. Hunting Party (1971) - Candice Bergen, a rancher's wife and schoolteacher, makes threesome with Oliver when he and his gang kidnap her for ransom. At first she is very resistant to the abductors but afterwards Oliver feeds her with peaches and she agrees to teach him lessons in gramercy. Subsequently they fall in love but unfortunately the rancher (Gene Hackman) organize a posse that exterminate the whole gang with long range rifle. At the end the three of them die in the desert;

3. Castaway (1986) - Amanda Donohoe, who actually became a celebrity with this movie, plays an unemployed secretary that agrees to become female companion for one year on uninhabited island in the Pacific. The film contains limited amount of nudity for which received complaints from the critics. However, Oliver takes care of business and they survive amidst the wilderness until end of time. Sort of ""Blue Lagoon"" film for grown-ups. So long and Thank You!",10

18 August 2004,Ridley Scott knows how to keep the audience interested.,"I've always liked Ridley Scott. I like Alien and Blade Runner, and all of his other films (except for perhaps Black Hawk Down). And I'd have to say this is one of his better films. Simply because every aspect of the film comes together and creates a beautiful, interesting and thoughtful story of a roman general. Plus we get some awesome battle scenes.

Maximus is a General in the Roman Army, in the year 180 A.D. He is leading the Roman armies to fight against the barbarian tribes of Germania. After all of Germania is conquered, Maximus looks forward to finally being able to go back home and seeing his wife and son again. But the Emperor has other duties for him. But before Maximus is able to perform those duties, the Emperor is killed and Maximus sentenced to death, by the Emperors own son: Commodus.

Maximus manages to escape the clutches of Commodus but finds that Commodus also ordered the death of his family. Maximus is however captured and sold off as a gladiator, and finds himself in a situation where he must fight to survive. But his real goal is to get revenge on the man who killed his family: Commodus.

The film is visually stunning. The battle scenes are awesome. The acting is superb. The script is excellent. Everything about this film is top-notch, but what can you expect from Ridley Scott? He directs the film like he knows exactly what he wants and the end result is something you'll want to watch over and over again.

Russel Crowe is absolutely fabulous in the role as Maximus. He outdoes himself completely. You really care for his character, and in the end I always find that a tear rolls down my eye whenever the end credits roll across the scene. Oliver Reed (R.I.P) also gives us a great performance as the aged gladiator; Proximo. To bad he died before principal photography had ended, and had to be replaced by a CG Puppet in some scenes (altough I never noticed this while watching the film). Juaqin Phoenix also gives a stellar performance as the insidious and evil Emperor Commodus.

The battle scenes are all great. My favorite is the battle between the Roman army and the Germanian tribes, which gives us some good IL' dirty warfare shots of people getting mutilated: The dark ages way. Other great scenes are when the gladiators are forced to play the part of the Barbarian horde in the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage. Hans Zimmers music in these scenes may very well be some of the best aggressive movie scores I've ever heard.

All of this, combined with Ridley Scotts excellent visual style and superb directing, makes for a flawless film that should never be forgotten.

23 November 2015,"""Are you not entertained?!""","I am sure you will be entertained by the end of Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Russel Crowe stars as a general, who is forced to fight in the arena as a Gladiator. There he enjoys success as the greatest gladiator. The film shows how betrayal can be destructive, and how the brave will conquer, while the coward will weep.

The Film, besides all then awesome sets, costumes and acting, the Action Sequences are spectacular, and will definitely leave you entertained. Ridleys Scotts Greatest Epic, proves to be one of the greatest films of the 2000s, and probably the best film of 2000.

Ridley Scott's direction is great. If another person directed this film, it would be dull and boring. But not with Ridley. He Captures the Exctiment, the Pain, and the bravery of the Characters as the Film goes on.

26 May 2000,"Lots of action, but little else...","Overall, Gladiator rates a 7 out of 10 for me.

Russell Crowe, one of the best lead actors of our day, gives a thoughtful performance and lends the role of Maximus a depth it almost doesn't deserve. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation - when the credits began to roll, I looked for the name of the unknown British actor who gave the role of the Emperor true believability, and I was surprised to see Joaquin's name. The rest of the supporting cast, including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, were excellent. Unfortunately Connie Nielsen's portrayal of the Emperor's sister failed to hit the right notes.

The effects are astounding, and the recreation of the Colliseum in Rome is awe-inspiring. My favorite scenes, however, were viewing the ""skyline"" of Rome itself from afar-- I don't think I've ever seen it so realistically portrayed-- I felt as if I were there.

My main complaints lie in the movie's length (overly long at 2:30 and draggy in some parts) and the ""choppiness"" of the action scenes. At the beginning, that fast-action/slow motion technique DOES make you feel as if you are one of the warriors, but its repeated use eventually makes you a little nauseated. As a result, you come away from the movie not remembering what you really saw in the action scenes.

The opening battle scene could have been called ""Saving Private Maximus"". And much of the repeated head-chopping reminds one of ""Braveheart"". But ""Gladiator"" doesn't live up to those superior films because it lacks the realism of Ryan's battle scenes, and the emotion of Braveheart.",7

14 May 2000,"""Veni, Vidi, Vici.""","Gaius Julius Caesar said this famous quote after conquering all opposing civilizations. And indeed the movie opens with a excellent battle scene depicting the organized Roman Legions versus the Barbaric Germans. A battle scene which will take its place next to other great movie battle scenes (i.e. - Braveheart, Private Ryan, Glory, etc...) The movie follows the rise and fall of Marcus Aurelius' (Caesar-Richard Harris) Greatest General Maximus Meridas (Russell Crowe) and then his rerise to power as not a general but a Gladiator fighting for his life in the Brutally Violent Colliseums of Rome. While the movie is not historically accurate as far as story goes (the film never states its factual anyhow) its still a great piece of work by director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner). Great musical score, cinematography, battle scenes and supporting cast. Djimon Hounsou and Ralph Moeller are fun to watch as Gladiators and Joaquin Phoenix is fun to watch (and laugh at) as Marcus Aurelius' son. Highly recommended for all fans of Battle Epic Movies.

11 July 2018,Atmospheric and astounding with view potholes,"At the peak of the Roman army, Maximus, a highly-trusted and beloved general is struck by tragedy as he must fight for vengeance\ Nuanced characters and excellent casting (with casting-director Louis DiGiaimo who also worked on The Godfather, The Exorcist and Thelma and Louise) Russell Crowe (also in A Beautiful Mind) stars in this epic as Maximus, with his main adversary played by Joaquin Phoenix (also stars in Her) as they battle both physically and mentally, each vying for a personal goal, with obvious and well established motives of the characters; hardly surprising seeing as one of the writers is John Logan who also worked as a writer on Skyfall. These motives allow for the characters to become relatable and understandable on most parts, although the downfall is strange and, in one case, uncharacteristic love interest seemingly created for no reason save to adhere to the voyeuristic side of the audience; to make them feel better about particular love interests. Another, yet minor, downfall of the film was within the first twelve minutes where Ridley Scott (also the director of Alien, Thelma and Louise and Blade Runner) felt the constantly annoying need to use slow-motion on the battle and to completely derive from the feeling and atmosphere of battle.

Although this aspect was only short, it leaves an impression (especially since it is used very early) but the intensity of the location mixed with the atmospheric climate, allow for the scene to be revered as amazing and leaves the viewer in awe, complimented by a Pirates of the Caribbean-esque soundtrack from Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer (who did work on some Pirates of the Caribbean films). The film does lack some elements of authenticity which its rivals in the war genre do not, although this is crowded by quotable lines delivered by Russell Crowe, and an overall memorable and splendid film.",
16 May 2020,Legend,"Revenge requires a strong belief as a support, especially when it's hard to find an opportunity to get close to your enemy. The Roman Empire added a lot of legends to this revenge story. Scenes of war and fight are shocking, and the sound is also top-level. Russell Crowe's eyes are quite sharp, like a real general.

2 January 2005,Overrated,"Gladiator is an ill-conceived Braveheart knockoff with a tired, predicable plot. Joaquin Phoenix, is unbearable as a one dimensional, stereotyped, sniveling, overwrought, incestuous Roman villain. Russell Crowe's performance was fine, satisfactory--as usual, but certainly not particularly inspired or stalwart. He is one of Hollywood's most overrated actors. The action sequences were entertaining and well choreographed, but story and originality of plot and characters suffered. Gladiator is standard, action fare, albeit with a setting infrequently revisited in recent years. What a shame this won best film.

18 September 2006,better than a sharpshord in the neck-or whatever,"Russell Crowe is a pretty fine actor. He has the gift of acting on film: if that is a gift-he has it. He has the capacity to connect with the viewer. This movie is typical Roman schlock/ history =low-brow tastelessness. How do you correctly tell a story about the Roman dirtbags? Crowe portrays the General, Gluteus Maximus, who tries to help the Roman dirtbags protect their dirtbag empire. *** Not that I have anything against Roman dirtbag empires*** At any rate, General Maximus Gluteus (Russell Crowe) gets in a big-ass world of trouble because actor Richard Harris, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, likes Russell/Gluteus the Maximus MORE than he loves Marcus Aurelius's own son: Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus Toiletus). Richard Harris had a big-ass career hit 38 years ago with ""MacArthur Park""-A fine and touching pop song which featured Richard Harris singing this masculine song in a powerful way, but an ultimately painful chorus. It was true grandeur in the pop world of AM radio. It was a sexual and sensual coup d'etat for AM radio which cannot be forgotten.I move on. General Gluteus Maximus runs away from Joaquin Phoenix(son of emperor Aurelius), and meets cool people who are slaves 'n' stuff. This is the second-reel...where a hero suffers and becomes a better person and stuff. Russell Crowe-General Maximus- meets tall African beautiful people who are slaves but act noble. Then, breathlessly, the screenwriter draws us back to Rome, where the evil Roman dirtbags live. The People in the gladiator arena in Rome like the gladiator, Crowe/Maximus , because that is what People do, when they have to think about something. Russell Crowe does big things, being noble. I bet the black Africans taught him something about being noble- because they have fine black skin, or something. In truth, tall and fine Africans are fine and beautiful people. This movie exploits them because this is a stupid Hollywood movie. Maximus puts up with repeated nonsense. He finds a way to win. hooray. I think this movie won the Oscar for best gay hairstyle on a leading Australian heterosexual man: Russell Crowe. what an honor. I believe Russell Crowe deserves better than this silly-ass Roman epic. just my opinion. Russell Crowe is just better than this silly trash-but then-really-so am I. Sometimes movies are just commerce. I don't mean to shock y'all. This a beautiful movie-full of great war scenes, and honor and courage. It is also a sleazy Roman history. Roman history is a sleazy Machiavellian thing. Sorry.",6
17 August 2003,Over-rated schlock,"That this movie beat out ""Traffic"" for the best picture Oscar is the definition of idiocy. I admire Ridley Scott, and liked Russell Crowe in ""The Insider"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" but they're both responsible for the debacle that is ""Gladiator.""

The rest of the world must have seen a different movie. I saw a bloated, overlong, tedious, humorless, joyless, tired, boring, ugly-looking, cliched film with terrible digital effects and lead characters with zero personality. Scott has directed two of my favorite movies, ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" but ""Gladiator"" is a dead zone. Anybody could have directed it. Alan Smithee may as well have done it.

Two movies show up ""Gladiator,"" even as it strives to be like both of them. They are ""Braveheart"" and ""Spartacus."" Both Mel Gibson and Kirk Douglas showed more zest for life (and violent death) than Russell Crowe, who appears to be either A) sleep walking or B) angry with Ridley Scott for putting him in the movie. What a boring performance! To see this kind of savage, revenge-driven character done right, there's still no topping Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace. It was over the top, but by golly, you felt the man's passion.

""Gladiator"" is a mess. I don't know any other way to describe it. Oscars and money don't always equal quality, apparently.",2
16 June 2010,Scott/Crowe Masterpiece,"i was shocked when i saw this movie. Just shocked. This is the best movie i've seen this year and Crowe did a fantastic job in this movie. Scott did a good job directing this movie.This movie is just plain epic and sad. I loved the emotions going on throughout the movie. Maximus was a slave and he became a very very skilled gladiator. Do you notice a big change going on throughout the movie? i recommend this movie to everyone. I think this movie is better then all the movies i reviewed in IMDb. This movie is terrific art. It seemed timeless throughout the movie. 10/10. If it went up to 20, i'll give it a 19/20 Have Fun With This Movie :)

9 May 2000,Most enjoyable - Ridley Scott has made a great comeback,"After some dissapointments (G.I. Jane wasn't to great, and White Squall was lacking at the end) I'm glad to say Ridley Scott is back in his game. I was looking forward to this film for awhile, it looked to be an impressive piece of cinema and plus, it had Russel Crowe in it. After a few months of waiting for it to come to theaters, I was it opening day with a sold out crowd. Everyone in the theater seemed to have really enjoyed it. Some thought it was to long (drags a lil at the beginning), some thought it was to violent (guess they haven't seen Braveheart), but most of us thought it was excellent.

I'm not gonna give anything away in this review like many have already done. I must say Ridley Scott hasn't had beautiful shots like this since Legend. The cinemtography really pulls you into the story - Rome has never looked this stunning. The acting was oustanding on all counts, everyone was very well casted. Above all, what hit me most about this movie wasn't the cinematography, nor the directing, nor the storyline. It was Russel Crowe. This guy proves himself that he is the Marlon Brando of the new generation. He's wonderful as Maximus, some of the weakest lines in the film he makes them sound amazing. I can only hope him and Edward Nortan, another actor who's amazing, will make a movie sometime together.

As for my dislikes of the movie - the editing. It's nice to see that a lot of people agree about how similar this is to Braveheart. Mel Gibson and Ridley Scott are very different directors and Scott approached this as an in your face kind of thing. For many scenes it dosen't bother you, but the opening battle and the first gladiator battle are very hard to follow because of this. I wish some of the action scenes lasted longer than they did, although the battles in Rome are oustanding. I wish I could have been able to tell what was going on a lot easier in the opening battle (the start of it as thousands of arrows fly through the air is magnificent) since everything happens very fast.

Overall though I expect this to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Maybe not in profit, but it has already made it on the top 250 so it seems most people love it. This movie will make Russel Crowe standout soon enough as another 20 million dollar actor, and he deserves it more than anyone. If you have the time, and the taste for a good action/drama, see Gladiator. 9/10",
16 April 2001,"Well done, Russell Crowe!","The film seems to be symptomatic: an empire turns out a film about an empire. So what do the audiences get? On the one hand, the scriptwriter will obviously not set the Thames on fire. The plot is very predictable, the action (especially in the first part of the film) dragged out, dialogue anaemic. There is a ""politically correct"" Juba and the optimistic end. Good guys go home, the evil emperor is punished, Commodus's sister makes another stilted speech. The drawbacks are numerous: first, I doubt that Marcus Aurelius looked so old (he died when he was 59), second, the child Lucius looks like a typical American kid with strange outfit on, Commodus was killed after he had reigned in Rome for 12 years.

So what keeps this film from being a tedious pseudo-Roman stuff? First of all, Russell Crowe. He managed to convey that sense of inborn dignity which can't be taken from a real Man. He did a very good job of his character bordering on magic (taking the poor stuff he had to work with into consideration). Second, it's the sound-track. And third, it's the work of the cameramen. The magnificent landscapes, the huge moon, the glimpses of the other world, the silver cypresses moving in the wind. I believe the film is hardly a new word in cinema, BUT it's a story of a Man, a human being at last, not a story of mundane violence. I think people are getting pretty tired of drugs and addicts, cops and mobsters, tearful soap operas. It's a ""fairy tale"" of course, too, but not a bad one.

I'd like to mention that an imdb-user Aleona said it was implausible that a Roman emperor had fought a gladiator. An encyclopedia says about Commodus that he took part in gladiator fights.",9
19 September 2019,Masterpiece!,"Gladiator is an absolute masterpiece from director Ridley Scott.what an amazing story line from the director. Russell Crowe lived his character & done a fantastic job.one of a great movie I have ever watched, must watch movie!

11 June 2002,It was okay,"*Gladiator*

In 2000 Gladiator proved that hype and money will win you a best picture. Gladiator was the LAST movie nominated that year that deserved best picture. If anything it was a harmless summer blockbuster that got too much hype.

I thought Russell Crowe was good in this movie, but not better than Tom Hanks. Crowe was better the year before in The Insider, but not as good as Kevin Spacey. The best performance HANDS DOWN was Joaquin Phoenix. I think Joaquin is a great and under-used actor. Just look at To Die For. Totally different roles, it's almost hard to believe they're the same person. If anyone deserved an Oscar that year, it wasn't Crowe, it wasn't Benicio Del Toro, it was Joaquin Phoenix. Del Toro should feel ashamed for accepting an Oscar he didn't deserve.

I liked the directing in this movie, the end was well done. But all the fluff between the fights were boring. Overall it was an okay movie, with plenty of hits and misses.

*5/10*",
20 November 2002,"Superior acting, story-line and cinematography","I like to try to ""switch"" roles in movies; then when the actors/actresses just don't measure up the same way the final cast does, then we can see just how hard casting directors must work to fulfill this delicate cog of the silver-screen wheel.

Russell Crowe as Maximus was a role just for that actor. Also the Emperor Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, that part was well cast. But the two fine actors just cannot be reversed with the roles, can they? Of course not.

The medium of movies requires tons of man-hours, equipment, then post-production, etc., all of this just to tell a story, entertain people for a very short time. Gladiator was that movie that utilized all available facilities and human potential to closely portray this tale of the Roman Empire circa 180 A.D. This movie really did not stray too far from reality as a lot of movies do, just for the entertainment value. We do know that the Coliseum existed, have historical accounts that closely resemble the living conditions and daily life of the people of 180 A.D.

Gladiator has a moral center in which the main characters never waved from even when it could be expected to do so under such conditions.

Maximus drove everything he had to accomplish what he did, against the insurmountable odds, and that makes a great story.",10
7 October 2019,hornor,"Entertainment as a tool for the ruler to achieve political goals. People want democracy. Only by not being ruled by the ruler can democracy be realized. Gladiator Ridley Scott tells the heroic tragic story with an epic image. One day I will return to my hometown. Brilliant and glorious!

20 May 2000,paint by numbers,"Gladiator wants to be rousing entertainment, but it's like a talented painter doing a paint-by-number kit and trying really hard not to go outside the lines. It was such a faithful retelling of standard, cliche gladiator movies that I could mouth most lines before they were uttered. It's probably the most faithful remake in history except for Psycho.

Which is not to say it doesn't manage some entertainment value. Russell Crowe is well cast, Joaquin Phoenix surprised me with his range (by showing he had some), and Connie Nelson gave a subtle performance when I would have expected something more heavy-handed. But the action sequences are choppily edited and filmed through a haze, making it hard to tell whose blood it is spraying across the screen (I could only assume it wasn't Crowe's character's).

I give it a six; anyone giving it higher than a seven is very easily amused.

13 June 2001,What the HELL this is the Best Picture?,"I like this movie dont get me wrong. It has some great action and an above average movie plot. But the BEST picture of the year?...and the Best Actor? did these people watch the movie before voting for it? Russ struts around puffing his chest out and he speaks a little more than Wilson from Cast Away. And for this he brings home an Oscar? I was busy trying to figure out how he got his nomination when blam...he wins. I would rather have seen Tom Arnold win an Oscar for is roll in ""Car Pool"". Well maybe its not THAT bad.

13 May 2000,Ridley Scott is back...!!!,"After a few sleeper hits and a few bombs (speaking from a box office point of view) Ridley Scott is well back on form with Gladiator. This is not, as some people might think, a no brain action flick. It actually has a story and the gladiator fights, which are superbly done by the way, don't play as big a part in the movie as you might think. All of Scotts visual flare is still very much apparant and adds some great atmosphere to the movie as do the CGI panoramas of the cities of Rome. The opening battle is breathtaking and actually shows what it's like in the roman trenches as it were, before a battle. Something you don't often see in a roman type movie. All the acting is brilliant especially Russel Crowe who deserves to go places and of course Oliver Reed and although he died during filming you really can't see the join were they filled in with computer graphics.

The musical score is also excellent and very emotive. Running a 150 minutes this movie asks a lot of your time but you wont be dissapointed.

28 May 2000,"highly watchable, but not at all a masterpiece","Visually speaking, Gladiator is fantastic, the depiction of Rome being particularly impressive. Furthermore, even at two and a half hours in length, the film is never boring, and I can't complain about the acting, either.

It's too bad therefore, that the ending is so mediocre. The entire production seems to fall apart in the last twenty minutes or so, climaxing conveniently rather than realistically. And, of course, the film isn't historically accurate, but who would have expected it to be?

Now, I don't mean to say that Gladiator isn't worth watching. In the end, it's a good way to kill a few hours; just don't expect it to amaze you. 8/10

17 April 2020,magnificent,"""Gladiator"" is a magnificent epic movie. It reproduces the glorious age of the Roman Empire and the tall image of Roman heroes through excellent production. Compared with other epic movies, the film does not make too much entanglement in historical details and religious topics, but instead conveys the theme of peace through the tragic story of Maximus. Ridley Scott used his deep director skills to create such a tragic story full of tension; the majestic arena, the magnificent war, the brave heroes are under the lens of Ridley Scott Shows a different charm and thick texture

23 February 2003,Period pieces can suck too?!?!?,"Emperor vs. Gladiator in a battle to the death. Live Sunday, Sunday, Sunday at The Collesium. Come one, come all. Price of admission will not be refunded if this film sucks.

Oh My Holy God, why couldn't you inspire this man Ridley (Riddle me a munch ass) Scott, to make a film that makes sense? What is this supposed to be?

Russell Crowe what did you do? Mr. Romper Stomper, Mr. L.A. Confidential? Why God Why?

Hey I got an idea let's make a modern version of this film.

Let's get President Bush in a steel cage against That serial sniper guy. That seems like a logical thing for a man of great political power to do.

Oh My God!

Is this the end?

Why did Maximus die? Why did he have to die? Oh this is tragic? Nothing has been more tragic in film history since Earnest bumped his head in ""Earnest Scared Stupid"".

This is a tragedy. Let's bite each others toe nails and give this an Academy Award.

Why does this keep happening.

9 May 2007,A stunning duel staged against the decaying Roman Empire.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
11 April 2014,The Gladiator,"The Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott is a classic. It is a film that can only be described as beautiful and elegant, with a storyline based on heartbreak and revenge. Russell Crowe gives the performance of his life as Maximus the Roman General who seeks revenge for the betrayal and murder of his family by the deceased emperors corrupt son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). You follow his struggle from near death to retribution in a mind blowing performance of grit and determination, given by his love and memories. The script is almost poetic so lots of praise must be given to David Franzoni. In conclusion this film is a must-see for every film lover no matter who they are. It truly is a masterpiece.

27 May 2000,Hopefully this will bring about a change,"Let's not kid ourselves, Gladiator is not Braveheart. Or Saving Private Ryan. Or any Kurasowa. It's a blockbuster, a summer film, a crowdpleaser. Usually films like that that put money before quality don't turn out to be very good. Gladiator SHOULD have been one of these films....a loud, pointless, 200 million dollar grossing flick, but strangely and surprisingly, it really isn't. The superb visuals and sets are topped only by the powerful acting from Crowe and the underappreciated Phoenix, as well as the skillful directing of still capable Scott.

Make sure you see Gladiator. Whether you're a summer blockbuster addict or one of those people who only see powerful, trenchant, great films, you should see Gladiator.

Let's hope that future summer action flicks turn out like Gladiator.

3 September 2004,Destined to be a classic,"Gladiator is an underrated movie to say the least. It should be on the top 10, and in my book it's at position 1.

People tend to think it's bad because it's not 100% historically accurate. Guess what, it's not a documentary, it shouldn't be judged as one.

The dialogue is strong and the story is the one we all love, and it plays out without flaw in Gladiator. The movie sets a new standard for the definition of epic. If you watch Spartacus or Ben-Hur after Gladiator, you notice how plain and un-epic those movies are in comparison.

All the actors performed flawlessly, especially Joaquin Phoenix (should have won an Oscar) and Connie Nielsen, I love the ""Am I not merciful"" scene, so much emotion with so few words. No single actor could be replaced to make this a better movie, it was a perfect cast.

The musical score is magnificent, it's so in sync with the action and the emotions on the screen, and so majestically epic, it's in itself destined to become a classic. Too bad Hans Zimmer was robbed of the Oscar.

The scenery is phenomenal, the landscapes are perfect, the CGI is top notch. You can FEEL the grandness of Rome. Splendid use of light and color in every single scene. I especially like the scene where Commodus and Maximus are elevated on to the arena, protected by a tortus formation of praetorian guards.

Are you not entertained? ARE you not entertained? YES, yes we ARE. Maximus, Maximus, Maximus, Maximus...

10/10 - A classic.",10
23 February 2011,Awesome and brutal,"Another Ridley Scott masterpiece, next to Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down etc.

Gladiator packs a lot of punches and drama, with violent arena battle scenes.

The film stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, etc.

In Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias (Russell Crowe) has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate. Marcus' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo's troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, Commodus' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus (Derek Jacobi).

Without a doubt, one of the best films I've seen.

And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",

8 April 2001,a clanker,"Whether this is the worst movie ever to be given Best Picture Oscar is a tricky question, when one thinks of, for example, ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Forrest Gump""... For Most Money and Research Used to Least Effect, the sinking of the White Star liner and the Roman Empire are just about a tie, but for contrived situations and dialogue that clanks worse than the armour (not to mention cheesy special effects), ""Gladiator"" is in a class of its own. The film's popularity, and its garland of ill-earned awards are a distressing instance of substituted reality (the late, unlamented Dr Paul Goebbels would have understood this very well), of hype feeding on itself: the movie, as a movie rather than a sales-campaign, is a dud.

9 October 2021,"Great family movie, and historical/action movie","You can never go wrong with this movie. Whether you are a history fan and love the Romans, or you love raw action movies. This movie has it all. Personally, I love both, and my name is Maximilian, so hearing my name be chanted during the movie gives me my own dopamine boost. This movie will never get old. A truly classic movie. And for you history lovers, it is one of the most accurate ""Hollywood"" depictions of Rome.

10 September 2000,Good acting,"The acting in this movie redeems the plot. Joaquim Phoenix is one of the most underrated actors, I feel. He's excellent in the movie especially in the scene with Richard Harris. Russell Crowe is adequete in his role and Richard Harris is good. Good costumes, but did Romans wear Indian Bindis at that time? Hmmm. The sets were good as well and this movie has definitely made me want to see go to Rome to admire the Architecture! The best scene is in the beginning, the Battle in Germania.Excellent direction.

25 July 2004,The Definition of 'Masterpiece',"David Franzoni's (Gladiator , King Arthur) prestigious writing skills, Ridley Scott's (Hannibal , Black Hawk Down) directing techniques, and a five-star cast present the audience with a true masterpiece. Also, outstanding music, set design, and battle effects create a solid, comfortable and emotional mood for viewers. Astonishing performances by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind , Master and Commander), Academy-Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (Signs , The Village [Not to mention, my favorite actor due to his performances.]), Connie Nielsen, and Richard Harris make this film a must-see. Spectacular battle scenes fill this movie, but I rather enjoy the work combination from Scott and Franzoni as they bring out a truly emotional storyline. Personally, the crew behind Gladiator definitely deserved the five Academy-Award (including Best Picture) victories. Did I forget the other seven nominations? I'll leave it at that. Masterpiece.

12 March 2001,"Great F/X, mediocre movie","Seeing the Colliseum in all its splendor is worth the price of admission all by itself, but there is little else memorable about Gladiator. The worst part is the hackneyed Hollywood sappy ending that leaves you feeling intellectually cheated. After Gladiator, I finally decided never to see another Hollywood blockbuster in the theater - why did it take me so long to learn that lesson? On an historical note, Commodus really did enjoy participating in the games, much to the embarrassment of the Roman upper class. He really was killed by a gladiator too, only, he was at home at the time and it was a wrestler named Narcissus who strangled him while the Praetorian Guard looked on.

10 June 2000,Why all that praise???,"I saw the movie last night and must say it could have been worse. The recreation of the antic Rome was a great job. That's what I liked about the movie. But the story????????? I don't know. When I heard about the movie I didn't want to see it at the movies but thought I would maybe rent it when it came out on video. But my friend asked me to join him so I did.

The first 30 minutes are really bad and I wanted to leave the theater. I am just not the kind of person who pays full price for a movie that is one big slaughter. I think it was very violent and where is the thrill when two people fight each other and many persons die? The movie did however get better when Russell Crowe got to Rome. Not good, but better. At least I was willing to sit through this to the end. The whole time I had 1 question: why all that praise? The critics love it and many viewers too. I can't see why. But I am not into those historical epics anyway. The actors were okay. Russell Crowe can be a good actor but this part was just boring. Joaquin Phoenix was so wonderful in Return To Paradise with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn. That movie should actually get all that praise, it's very good. He still gave a good performance in Gladiator. Overall, it was okay because it got better when Russell came to Rome and there are beautiful pictures in this movie. But don't bother to wait until it comes out on video or they show it on TV. I rate it 4/10.",4
27 December 2000,"Great entertainment, a bit overrated","Don't get me wrong, this is a very enjoyable flick but as I write this it's ranked #76 of all time at IMDB? That's a bit overrated. I would put it as a very good movie of 2000 but that's about it. It's more like an old Cecil B. Demille film (e.g. ""Ten Commandments"") in that it's great entertainment with a huge budget & sets. Or for a more modern analogy, it's more along the lines of the grandiose pomposity of the ""Titanic"" movie or ""The Patriot."" But it's far from being an important or classic movie in the canon (although admittedly in my opinion there are other duds in the ""Top 250"" IMDB list, such as ""Braveheart"" @ #66).

18 May 2004,"Emotional, evocative, emphatic - and f**cking violent!","This film really does have it all.

It's got the best British director at the wheel, it's got the pure charisma of Russell Crowe, it's got sword fighting with Romans, it's got an amzing musical score, it's got great special effects, its got the best cinematography you've seen in years, it's got evocative historical accuracy, it's got a man fighting a tiger, it's got Ollie Reed (clearly p***ed on a few occasions)............the bloody lot then.

THe mastery of this film is the way in which the heart-wrenching story of Maximus is interwoven into a historical epic. THe story would have been a success even if Gladiator was lacking in the human element, but the fact is that the unholy tragedy that befalls Crowe and his subsequent quest for revenge drive the rest of the film, and make all of the various actions scenes those of 'higher stakes' than normally expected (ie. the only risk is your own skin, here it is a whole set of moral beliefs and a legacy of love).

Such a perfect fusion of drama, acting, action and musical score, this film is Hollywood at it's very best, with a British twist - humilty. See it as soon as you possibly can.

9/10 A future classic.",9
4 December 2014,Gory but really good !!,"This is a very known movie. If you haven't seen it you've probably heard someone say it was good, and it is. A great film and some outstanding acting. Good character development. Great recreation of Rome and the Colosseum, with nice costuming and a decent supporting cast. Where Gladiator does triumph, is in its ability to express the sheer depth of the inhumanity and evil that drove the Romans to lust for gladiatorial combat. It's portrayed unflinchingly in all its gory horror.

Yes, it was violent, so if you are sensitive to violence I would say you should find something else to watch.

26 April 2000,Incredible,"I was lucky enough to catch the Dreamworks press screening for this movie and I must say this is the best film I have seen since Braveheart. Better action sequences, better fights, and pure testosterone action with oscar calibre dialogue. This is truly the first must see movie in years that not only lives up to the hype, but moves beyond it. Russel Crowe is now an official star.

11 May 2016,Not Living Up To The Hype,"The film doesn't truly 'take off' until exactly 50 minutes in. The 'big battle' scene which kicks off the film should have got my pulse racing. Instead, it left me wondering why I bothered to watch.

The magnificent Colosseum doesn't get a look in until 1 hour and 20 Minutes and even then the graphics are very fake looking (even for the year 2000) and there is not enough shots to showcase the size of the historic amphitheatre.

The first battle scene in the Colosseum takes place shortly after this 1 hour and 20 mark, and at last - it's good viewing. Joaquin Phoenix plays the stereotypical spoilt brat Emperor with Daddy issues and having seen him in countless other films, it's fair to say his acting at it's height in this film.

It's now 16 years old, so I will forgive the cheap looking Colosseum shots, but with 1997's Titanic being 20 years old next year - it still stands a lot stronger than 'Gladiator'.

What annoys me is how highly rated this film is, as well as the hype and numerous accolades. I can only put it down to the fact that this film re-ignited interest in the Roman Empire and it was most certainly a good-looking film to kick off the Millennium.

Sadly, it's not for me.",5
3 January 2002,a masterpiece of courage,"Some people would compare this film to Braveheart. it may be true but not always. Braveheart was a film about a man's fight for freedom. Gladiator is a film about a man's fight for justice and what he feels should be rational. i saw this film once again on New Year's Day and i was captivated by it. Russell Crowe gave a performance of what I led to belive may be the best performance he has ever given. One of the many aspects of the film is the direction as well as the cinematography. Ridley Scott is a visionary director and he creates this movie pictures that will stick out in our minds forever. the battle scenes as well as the stadium scenes may be quite brutal but it's important to know about it and see it because these most of the people back in those times who fought in these stadiums were slaves and they fought to show that they were courageous and wanted their justice. this may be a one of those films that was rapidly paced. The film was two and a half hours long but it seemed like a hour less because the film went by so quickly. I really believe that Gladiator is one of the best films i have ever seen as well as one of the best action films i have ever seen. The acting was excellent and the directing was magnificent. If you want to see a movie that will leave you in awe or what to learn about the history of ancient societies such as Roman societies, take a look at this film. You will be amazed!",
14 May 2000,Restless because of Maximus,"I saw ""Gladiator"" at the late show and then went home and tried to get a good night's sleep. Forget it. First of all, this movie is an adrenaline pump for impressionable viewers. Maximus's world is full of danger through the whole film and the viewer shares those fears and thrills, the battles, the gladiator bouts, the secret conspirings. Secondly, this movie fills your heart with sadness and you are drained and upset when you walk out of there.

DON'T try tell anyone that this movie lacks emotion....give me a break! Not since ""Braveheart"" have I had such a love of a main character. This dude is a hero in the true sense of the word, totally fearless and driven to achieve his goals no matter what. Russell Crowe plays him with a modest, almost shy demeanor that is very engaging, considering the character's physical attributes and skills.

The photography is spectacular. The long sweeps of scenery (again reminiscent of the scenes of Scotland in ""Braveheart"") are breathtaking and the depiction of life during those times and especially what Rome was like was one of the best aspects of the movie.

I gave this a 9 out of 10, only because some of the dialogue was a little lame and the acting was OK across the board, but not brilliant. GO SEE IT!",9
31 May 2000,Maybe it will be better on the small screen,"First off let me say this film was merely OK, nothing more, nothing less. We've seen this story dozens of times before, in a dozen different genres, from gladiator movies to football films. The antagonist attempts to, and sometimes does, force out the film's opening hero only to have the hero come back, after a period of rebuilding and soul searching, and defeat the antagonist in the end. James Caan and John Houseman did it much better in ""Rollerball"" The characters were all your standard Roman cliches with the exception of the wonderful final performance by Oliver Reed. This was the film's one saving grace.

The film style in the battle and fight scenes was rocky enough to give the most stalwart rollercoaster fan motion sickness, while the more cerebral portions of the film were so deadly dull that these sections could cure even the worst insomniac. I saw the film at the Cinerama in Seattle and that magnifies everything about the film, especially its flaws. Maybe it will be easier to watch when it hits the small (TV) screen.",2
18 May 2000,"It's been a long time coming, but finally another gladiator flick hits the big screen!","Director Ridley Scott brings this blockbuster epic tale of ancient Rome to a modern audience. Russell Crowe plays the general to Marcus Aurelius Caesar, Richard Harris is the emperor, who defeats the Germanian army. In the aftermath, Caesar dies of ""mysterious"" causes and his son, Joaquin Phoenix, takes the crown. He orders Crowe to be executed, but Crowe escapes, only to be trained by Oliver Reed as an arena gladiator. Crowe becomes a favorite of the bloodthirsty crowds by the time that Phoenix learns of his escape. Soon, Phoenix and Crowe will have to come across one another's path. The film has great flavor for the period and solid acting and good computer enhanced effects, but the battle scenes are too often done in a stylized, close-up manner, which makes it difficult to discern exactly what is happening. Sadly, Reed died during the filming and, thus, this is his final film.

3 June 2000,This is why I go to the movies,"Crowe had me shouting ""Strength and honour!"" at people after seeing this movie. Went to see it again the other day, and I might go back and see it one more time between now and 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' (I'm a sucker for all the big summer blockbusters, God love 'em).

This is why I go to the movies. It is so perfect, it's almost as if they were thinking of me when they made it. A bunch of Hollywood suits sitting around a table discussing, ""What kind of movie does this Shecky want to see?"". Hey, it could happen.

Man, if Russell Crowe were any cooler in this movie he'd be Clint Eastwood. If this guy isn't on the $20 million a picture list now, there is no justice.

What else is there to like about this movie? Huge, bloody battles, some of the most beautiful works of violence ever put to film. Sir Ridley Scott, we salute you! Someone in the audience not versed in movie theatre etiquette clapped at all the most exciting parts, and while I did not join him/her, they were expressing what I was feeling inside, complete and utter joy.

""At my command, unleash hell"". God, yes! I don't know how long I have waited for someone to say that in a motion picture. Goosebumps. For real. All the way through this movie I was getting goosebumps on my flesh. And at the end... well... those weren't tears.... I must have had something in my eye.... yeah, that's it....

Well, if I don't give this movie a 10/10 stars, I don't know what else is worthy of it this year. Magnolia maybe, and that's about it. Go see it for yourself if you don't believe me. I'm always right about these things. G'night!",10
17 December 2000,One of the best films of 2000,"In a year that featured more misses than hits, there were some diamonds in the rough. Among these was Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"". ""Gladiator"" is sort of a departure for Ridley, who usually is into features portraying a dark and depressing future(""Alien"" ""Blade Runner""). Gladiator is a period move, but is not exactly historically accurate-for instance, there was no ""Maximus"" and Commudus ruled far longer than the span of time in the movie. But regardless of this, it's still a compelling story, pulled off convincingly with excellent performances by Russel Crowe(Maximus) and Waiken Pheonix(Commudius). There are also some nifty battle scenes, particually the Battle of Carthage recreation. I wasn't too big a fan of the Romans vs. the Germans battle at the beginning though-the editing was just a little too strange. But overall, the film is pretty good, and I wouldn't be suprised if it gets nominated for a few Oscars(Especially considering the slim pickings this year)

10 July 2007,"Good film, yet overrated","If you have seen Spartacus, Quo Vadis, The Robe, and even Ben Hur, then you know there is really nothing new here. Where the aforementioned films used fabulous set designs and second unit directing, this film opts to try to impress the viewer with computer generated scenes meant to impress the eye in an artificial manner. Russell Crowe seemed to have phoned in his performance on this one, and is very disappointing considering his range as an actor. His Academy Award for this film was to compensate for his loss for the film, ""The Insider"", in which he was truly excellent. While it was good to see old timer pros like Reed and Harris, they only served to remind the viewer of those days when Hollywood knew how to produce a spectacle through solid direction, set design, and the coordination of extras through the use of second unit directing, i.e., Yakima Canutt. A good filmed marred by Crowe's unusually wooden performance. As for Joaquini Phoenix, well, he was very good as usual, but his characterization was a repeat of Peter Ustinov's in Quo Vadis.

23 August 2011,A Champion,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
29 May 2000,BRILLIANT,"Gladiator is an absolutely fantastic movie. The special effects and sets are some of the best ever seen on film. The acting is excellent too. The movie lasts for two and a half hours, but when you're watching it you never think about the time, which is a sign that a movie is good.

7 July 2012,How come Prometheus?,"I can't add anything to other reviews other than to say it is one of my top 10 movies (along with Alien I might add). I use bits of it in my consultancy work because it is chock full of wonderful and inspirational lines.

At my signal, unleash hell. Some people don't know when they are conquered. Hold the line, stay with me. Whatever comes out that door we have more chance of surviving if we stay together.

Even though he is a New Zealander (not Australian as some believe) I do wax and wane on Russell Crowe a bit but there is no doubt this is his tour de force to date. But then all of the acting is superb and I really enjoyed Oliver Reed (Women in Love, The Devils, two other of my favourite movies).

What I don't understand is how Ridley Scott directed the pile of manure that is Prometheus. I just don't get it. Maybe someone can enlighten me.",9
29 May 2000,A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance = An excellent motion picture.,"I have to admit that I entered my local multiplex with an endless dose of scepsis about `Gladiator' convinced that it's going to be just another popcorn entertainment project of modern Hollywood postoriginality, and it is in some way, except it's, in my opinion and my experience, a lot more. And that makes him more than just worth seeing.

The creators took a traditional matrix of old Hollywood spectacles and then did one of the hardest screenwriting jobs today and that's to lay a modern superstructure on top of it, balance the pieces well, measure the chill, the drama and the romance correctly and finally construct the visual performance in a manner which stories of this magnitude deserve. The creators did all that amazingly powerful, convincing and emotinally hammering bringing todays artistic conscience and computer techinque abilities to the borders of possible never going over the line or overdoing the performance to make it in discrepancy with the given plot. HOWEVER ...

... They did a crucial job to the film's final quality by rewriting the original draft which, among other differences, had a happy end, and that's something that proves that they knew what they were doing. I was very afraid, to say at least, that it will be a conventional happy-end-movie, and was prepared for that conclusion already seeing Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen kissing in front of the sundown in the closing shot of the film, and if the original draft wa kept in the final version of the movie I would be even more disappointed than I was preparing to be, because the film was constantly promising a lot more than that kind of conclusion. I can't express how relieved, satisfied, moved and touched I was when that didn't happen.

I have to say that the intro battle in Germania and the fight between Maximus and Tiger are two of five most spectacular action sequences I've ever seen in movies, the `big fight' at the end one of the strongest finales in history, and the end altogather delivers one of the most moving conclusions in recent times, and one of the most important in history of the world, too.

All actors give strong performances, I myself was especially impressed by young Joaquin Phoenix and his magnificent portrayal of Commodus - one of the most repulsive, and yet believable bad guys I have ever seen - and also by his unique ease in snapping from character in one style of performance and film to another completely different, diametrically opposite one. The performance by young actor who playes Lucius will be the unsung one, although I hold that the kid was so good and convincing in his behaviour for the period his character's in, that he deserved a lot more screen time.

I was sincerely moved by the film in a lot of ways a film can get to you, and think it's a proof, more than welcome one, that Hollywood can still make great, full-blooded movies which get under your skin even without much originality or genuine artistic idealism that always heads for the development of new approaches to storytelling. Or maybe `A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance' is a way to go if a lot of new Hollywood products will have the final quality of this one. In another words: Be excellent motion pictures. Because this one certainly is.",10
10 June 2011,Nearly a very good film,"A decent historical/action film which is unfortunately spoiled by too much dreary Irish music. As have been so many other nearly good movies, such as the Lord of the Rings series.

Who thinks this drippy wailing schmaltz is a suitable accompaniment for any worthy action?

Not me, anyhow.

One of the very nice things about Gladiator is that Oliver Reed gets a decent part, suited to his skills, and that he acts it with admirable restraint. The other principals all do well, particularly Joaquin Phoenix, who exudes corruption and malice in every scene.

12 June 2000,Spellbound!!,"If Russell Crowe does not win Best Actor at next years Oscar's there is something wrong with the establishment!! I was surprised that this film was an 15 because it can be a bit bloody at times, but like all good stories the good man was good and the bad man was really bad! This film is an epic but the computer effects let it down just a little bit. Why is it that in all good stories the women are flaky and the kids always give away the plot? Watching this film reminded me that Oliver Reed was going to be sadly missed as he was an actor of the old school. My last words about this film is see it or be extremely sorry! GO!!

20 January 2016,Potential not fully used,"So i watched this movie because it was suggested after watching 300 (which i liked better to be honest) and at the beginning i liked it very much, but the end was very predictable. One big disappointment was the language. Before i watched this movie, i watched Narcos with its authentic Spanish, Braveheart with this awesome Scottish Accent and Inglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt and his cool Tennessee Accent. I don't want to say that the whole movie should have been in Latin, but this American English destroyed the whole atmosphere. I would not say it's a shitty movie, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an eight-point-five score.

26 January 2006,Beautiful Tale of Revenge and Power,"""Gladiator"" is about revenge and the struggle between two men for Rome, one an emperor, the other a gladiator slave. The movie begins as Emperor Marcus Aurelius ends his twelve year campaign against the ""barbarians"" to secure the borders of the Roman empire. Following a victory against a Germanic tribe, Aurelius tells his favorite general (who is like a son to him) that he wants him to be his successor and to be the ""protector"" of Rome until the Senate is ready to rule. He wants Rome to be republic once more, but has reservations about whether his son Commodos is willing to give up power. The favored general, Maximus, turns down the emperor's offer because he does not feel that he has the political background to rule Rome, and because he wants nothing more than to go home to his wife and child.

In less than a night, Maximus' hand is forced when Commodos assassinates Aurelius and declares himself his heir. When Maximus realizes what has happened, he refuses to give Commodos his loyalty. Commodos orders him and his family executed. Maximus escapes, but his family is burned and crucified (an execution method of which the Romans were particularly fond). Maximus is enslaved and turned into a gladiator when a passing caravan finds him at his burned out home unconscious. Gladiator fights have become very popular since Commodos overturned his father's ban on them, and the man who runs the gladiator school where Maximus is being trained, Proximo, if looking to profit from his new acquisition. Although he initially refuses to fight, Maximus soon gains fame throughout the empire, and respect from his fellow fighters, as ""the Spaniard,"" and eventually finds himself fighting in the Coloseum in Rome.

The Rome that greets Maximus is completely under the spell of Commodos, who has won the people over with spectacular gladiator matches. When Maximus become a crowd favorite, Commodos takes an interest in him (not having recognized him). As the two men meet in the middle of the arena, and ""the Spaniard""'s real identify is revealed, a power shift occurs, and Commodos realizes that he can no longer kill Maximus and still keep the Roman public on his side. Maximus realizes this as well, and what follows is a beautifully orchestrated contest of powers between the two men, which culminates in a final showdown in the Coloseum, and an emotionally charged ending.

Also to be commended is Hans Zimmer for his beautiful score.",9
23 July 2018,Ancient times were not the best times,"Do you love action? Child endangerment? Love the Roman empire? Incest? This is the movie for you. A lot happens in it's long run time. Dont get me wrong though it's a fun ride throughout. With only a couple parts that drag. Otherwise decent pacing. Great acting by most of the cast. Phoenix is fun. One of the classics that you should definitely try and watch

6 May 2016,A milestone in cinematic history,"WARNING: This review may contain spoilers

Ridley Scott shapes the decade with this masterpiece.It is very rare to find a movie, which is this complete like Gladiator. Russell Crowe is embodying the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius like he was born for this role. While watching the movie, you can feel the striking and courageous personality of the Spaniard, like they call him in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix was the most perfect antagonist they could've taken for. His underhand and egoistic character made the spectator hating him as the role of Commodus - thats why he was nominated as best actor in a supporting role at 2001 Oscars. When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. This sentence was written by IMDb and in my opinion I can approve this! If you want to watch a complete movie, where music, scene play, script and pretty everything is important - then watch Gladiator that has been distinguished with 5 Oscars.",10
1 February 2001,fiction better than reality; the mindset of Rome,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
30 January 2001,A triumphant achievement from all angles,"So what if Commodus was actually murdered in his bathtub? And honestly, do we care that he actually ruled with his father Marcus Aurelius as co-emperor for several years before Marcus Aurelius died? At least, these are some of the facts which have been rearranged in ""Gladiator"", but why not take liberties with poetic license?! Great cinema is about drama, and this is not a documentary, nor will the audience be disappointed by what they see. Gladiator gives the audience what it wants: the human connection. History is not flat, lying on a page. It was real, as real as today is now, and in Gladiator, history is alive, visually compelling... transporting. What higher compliment could we give than that so many people have been able to instantly identify with a time and place that most of those watching this film have never given much thought to before? How can this in itself not be called a triumph? And I would even argue that the writers of these historical epics *must* truncate and rearrange so many aspects of one historical era to reproduce the whole for our understanding... thus aspects of the equally despotic Roman emperors Caligula and Nero are merged with the character of Commodus... but Gladiator is not merely a visual success, or that merely because of its fantastic special effects. It is quite simply a compelling story. We all support Maximus in his fight to avenge the murders of his wife and son. We all love to watch the strangely intriguing performance of the ambitious, luminously mad emperor Commodus... and the delicate maneuvering of his politically-minded sister, Lucilla! The acting in Gladiator is also reason enough to see the film. Not only have we the last performance of the great Shakespearean actor Oliver Reed playing Promximo, and the incomparable Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, but two new luminaries on the cinematic horizon: Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. If great acting can be accomplished with the simple movement of the eyes, if great acting, as has often been said, can be achieved with and within the subtlety of a single expression, then these two have mastered the art of great acting! A telling point would be to see the film dubbed into Italian (close to Roman Latin); this would prove, I think, how talented these actors are in the expressiveness of their emotions through the eyes and body language, as well as through their fantastic speaking voices. As for Connie Nielsen, I have to say that she was excellently cast as the elegant Lucilla; had Ridley Scott substituted her for any other more well-known but less capable Hollywood actress, I think the role would have been the film's greatest weakness. In fact, it was a wise choice to cast this film with extremely talented but less well-known actors (though NOT ANY MORE!), or else Gladiator may not have seemed so realistic, nor made so powerful an impact on so many. I would recommend this film to anyone. My rating: 11/10.",10
15 January 2021,A Sweeping Classic,"I fail to understand anyone who claims this film has no emotional depth or punch..just listen to the Score! It is magnificently directed,produced and acted by a superb Cast! A classic Story of Roman War,decay,revenge and redemption ..told with power, pace and poetry!!

20 October 2002,"Whether you like it or not, this is a true epic.","Perhaps a little late coming, but still worth the time to review.

So much has already been said about this movie that it's difficult to even come up with anything of any originality at this time. This movie is such a joy from start to finish that it's difficult to find much fault with it. Enjoyed originally in the cinema, and then on a large widescreen TV with the correct DTS surround setup, 'Gladiator' maintains a terrific atmosphere thanks to Ridley Scott's fantastic direction, and a phenomenal score by the great Hans Zimmer. Yes, some might find the fight sequences a little fast and the camera movement difficult to focus on in places, but if you let the movie wash over you, it completely trounces any movie of the year 2000, and pretty much every movie since then in terms of style, quality, and presentation. Spend some time studying the actors movements, and it's a real joy seeing Joaquin Pheonix's expressions of anger and torment throughout the movie. Acting at its finest all round, in fact.

If you haven't already seen this movie, do so as soon as possible. Epic in every sense of the word.",
7 November 2004,Not the jewel everyone is looking for,"Battlefield Earth still gets my vote for the worst movie ever (beating out Waterworld hands down). But this has to rate close to it. People, this movie is bad. It has no sensible dialogue, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast (he would've been strangled the next week by the praetorian guard), and Crow is slipping in his choice of trash. We're not even going to ask for historical accuracy (by the way, there isn't any) since that would be either too much or too confusing.

No character in this movie had any depth. I am still curious how the whole legion did not notice the absence of their ""beloved"" general. I am lost at how a man who went to France ended up in a desert on a cart. I am amazed that at first this man doesn't care about anything, then he wants revenge, then he doesn't, then he yells at that queen, then.. you get the point. And after that, a slave owner who sent people to their deaths dies with ""honor"" on his lips. Then, a woman who stood by and did nothing while her brother was slaughtering people is preaching to the good citizens of Rome the merits of honor and justice (she preached to the crowds that came to see people be decapitated). The contrasts of good and evil were so well defined, that no three year old will be confused.

This movie must rate high with audiences, but so does Scooby Doo. If you like the mental twists of Scooby Doo, you'll like this movie as well.",5
28 May 2022,Great. Could be Incredible.,"Wow. That's good. Honestly, not as good as I expected. Just less plot than I thought there was. But overall, yeah, very good film. Convincing action, excellent acting, and beautiful scenery make this movie truly great. As always, gotta love me some Russell Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is creepy and disfunctional as ever. Just so good. There were some flukes I noticed, and the ending is not what I would prefer, but it is, as a whole, a great film. Not for kids, simply because of the violence, but really well executed. Definitely watching again. 85/100

1 May 2017,Old Gold,"Everyone remembers the glories days of Rome. Chariot racing, Animal fighting and audience applause's but it takes a real talented director to tell the story and gladiator doesn't disappoint with A-list casting which was a milestone for actor Russel Crowe. A dust brown visual that is perfect for the ancient world theme. Soundtrack (esp the epilogue) which is up lifting and downright heartbreaking sometimes. This movie is one of my favorites and it will continue to be.

30 April 2000,"50% spectacle, 50% cheese","Well, it's safe to say that ""Gladiator"" is far from a disappointment. It'll also satisfy many, particularly fans of the sandle-epics of the '50's and '60s. Be forewarned, however, despite the innately cheesy dialogue and innane plot diversions, ""Gladiator"" is anything but an old-fashioned technicolor epic. If anything, ""Gladiator"" moves too far the other way, employing an MTV-generation editing style and visual aesthetic that is dizzying and, moreover, overstated. As well, Scott makes the dreadful mistake of beginning his film with a battle scene that is shot and edited in a fashion identical to the opening scene of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" complete with washed-out colours, varied speeds of motion and muffled sound. If you can look over this, however, you're in for some truly spectacular Gladiator fight scenes in a cinematic mock-up of the Roman Coliseum and 2nd century A.D. Rome. Here, Scott's style shines, in much the same way it did with Blade Runner almost 2 decades previous. Rome's ancient architecture is rendered believably real, with the employment of special effect techniques that seemed frivolous and tiresome in last year's ""Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace."" Strangely enough, the future of the historical epic looks bright. And so does Russell Crowe's career, mind you. He manages to ground the film with his character, even when it seems as if the plot is about to drift off into a cheesy abyss.",7
16 July 2001,Ben Hur Lite,"Gladiator is an infuriating movie, an immensely overrated Ben Hur light that is clearly a graduate of the Armageddon school of filmmaking. Nevertheless, it does some things very well. And this is the problem perhaps. The combat sequences are a sight to behold, as exhilarating in their beautiful bloodshed as anything Ridley Scott has ever done (and he is the American master of beautiful bloodshed). But the drama that connects these sequences seem only filler, existing only to move us (sometimes in a most incoherent way geographically speaking) to the next moment Russell Crowe gets to bear his teeth and fight another battle.

But how is this a good movie? If anything Gladiator is more of a punched up, swords a blazing series of dance numbers. The drama rests on the shoulders of a one note performance by Russell Crowe, whose core emotion seems to be one of grimace and pout. He is a character who has one desire and one desire only: revenge. Many critics loved the intensity of the performance but why? A complex, interesting character should have complexity to them. But this character has no complexity, no range of emotions: he is a Stallone character trapped in an art film.

Joaquim Phoenix, on the other hand, was a delight, an over the top sociopath who brings a few precious moments of levity to an otherwise drab, ugly, and humorless film.",3
3 March 2001,Mortal Kombat wins,"The plot, being old as the hills, is nothing to write home about.

And the lines about ""win the mob"", ""give them blood"" seemed more than a little ironic. Talk about a movie aimed at the Mortal Kombat crowd.

The cinematography was amazing. His long shots constantly reminded me of Maxwell Parrish; the quick Koyonasquaatsie-like ""nature moving fast"" shots were effective, and scene after scene of indoor opulence and/or mood-setting were meticulously lit.

Shame that such a talent as Scott's must be burned creating such a mundane barn-burner.

3 December 2000,Scott's own Shakespearean Tragedy,"I've heard people and critics alike knock and praise this film left and right. However, although I found this film exceedingly long and somewhat boring at points, I do believe I sympathize w/ it's overall message. Its message is although it's centered around the ignorance and inhumanity of Roman pop-culture of the ancient world it's really parodizing and somewhat mocking America's bloodthirsty obsession w/ sex and violence in today's trashy pop-culture.

At some points, it plays out like a Shakespearean tragedy. At others it plays out like a John Woo actioner. I do think that Jouquin Phoenix proves himself as an actor, since I've not seen him anything but two small previous roles including 8mm. Otherwise, I do believe that the technology of the times was so fantastic-seeming it's hokey.

Overall, I'd recommend the DVD for the fans who'd really enjoy it, since there's another 21/2 hrs of deleted scenes and documentaries on another disc.

28 January 2002,What's the big deal?,"I just want to say that this movie did not deserve the oscar for best actor or for best picture. I just don't understand it. It seems like the Academy Awards aren't the best at picking who and what deserves it, just like Julia Roberts winning over Ellen Burstyn. All she did was act pissed off and wear revealing clothes. Many actresses could've done that.

Anyway, this movie is just a bigger budget for a Jean Claude Van Damme movie. A tough guy's family gets hurt, and he goes out for revenge, but along the way he gets tortured and hurt yet kicks all their butts. That pretty much sums it up...

2 September 2000,"terrible, really terrible","This movie one more time shows that Americans doesn't know and even doesn't want to know the history besieds their own. Does anyone really thinks that soldiers in Rome army applied as 'sir' to their chief. Or it was made just for Americans to understand it easier? And why Maximus is General. What's the rank of Rome army? Second, the story is a fake. There really was such emperor as Commodius, but he wasn't killed on the stadium. Third, does anyone thinks that the emperor, wishing to kill somebody will stop if the folk love that person? The screenplay is written very bad. All the dialogues are separated from each other and sometimes I couldn't understand what was the purpose of one or another dialogue.

4 April 2001,Best Picture???,"""Gladiator"" is by no means a bad movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to ""Traffic"" or ""Crouching Tiger"".

It seems that Hollywood wanted to celebrate the rebirth of a classic genre, the Roman epic, but it's a shame that such an unspectacular film has received so many accolades.

In particular, I was highly disappointed with the cinematography. Why, oh why, do all modern directors (other than Ang Lee) think that every action scene must feature a shaking camera and intermittently altered film speed, both of which interfere with the viewer's ability to actually SEE what's going on? The battle scenes, while impressively staged, were not filmed nearly as well as ""Braveheart"", the swordplay looks quite tame compared to ""Crouching Tiger"", and you can find more impressive Colosseum action in ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben Hur"". The plot and dialogue were hack writing at best and revisionist history at worst, with clearly American sentiments filling in for anything recognizably Roman.

There is actually a lot to like about this movie. The sets are dazzling, the acting is quite good, and the drama is often quite real... although it isn't sustained throughout. Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and commands a tremendous screen presence, although he displays less range than in his earlier work. Joaquin Phoenix manages (barely) to avoid falling into the realm of camp, although he is dealt quite a few inane lines. In fact, all the main actors deserve tremendous kudos for salvaging what could have been a bomb in less capable hands. It's worth noting that ""Gladiator"" received Oscars for acting and costumes, not for directing, cinematography, or screenplay.

But Best Picture? Are you kidding me? This isn't even Ridley Scott's best picture. I demand a recount.",7
25 January 2001,Where was all that money spent-a big disappointment,"I didn't watch this movie expecting great acting or literate writing. In this I certainly wasn't disappointed. I also didn't expect to see any real history presented. Even otherwise great movies take more than a little liberty with historical fact but this one was so far off they might as well have used completely fictional characters. The real disappointment is with the much praised visuals. When Maximus and the other gladiators enter the coliseum it is announced that they are going to present a re-enactment of the siege of Carthage. In the REAL coliseum they presented such shows with casts of hundreds of gladiators complete with elaborate staging. Parts of the coliseum were even flooded to support ships for naval battles. You would think that with a huge budget and modern effects capabilities they could have done much better.

19 November 2000,"A ""tuff,"" insignificant movie with hardcore Crowe","GLADIATOR is more or less, a ""tuff"" movie. It's an excuse to showcase some brutal violence, as well as to showcase a knock-out performance by that one guy who broke up Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan for a little while. Oh yeah, that's Russell Crowe. That guy is ""tuff!"" Every scene he's in, he finds a new way to show the audience that he's a hard-ass. It's really funny when I think about it. That I'm writing the 1128th review for a movie that's as harmless as the latest installment in the LAND BEFORE TIME video series. This movie should not be the topic of debate. It matters so little. It's a neat, ""epic,"" dumb action movie. How many of these do we see a year? This one just happened to have Russell Crowe. God, that guy's ""tuff!""

12 June 2006,#1- The transition of a top general to a gladiator to the savior of Rome,"The best movie ever made. One of the first to move me to tears at the end. Excellent plot, direction and acting. All else pales in comparison. I dare you to watch it because it will blow your mind. And for the losers that think they should nitpick about the historical accuracy of it, or the existence of the characters: It's fiction not a documentary of the gladiatorial lifestyles. The movie paints a beautiful view of Rome, its armies, the leaders and the land. Again, the acting is impeccable. In fact, the movie is so well done, there have been rip offs of it made. For instance, see Troy. A mediocre film with mediocre actors. As well, the direction is so much better. The fight scenes in Gladiator are beautiful, yet don't focus on the gore, as if to make some cheesy thriller. It's all about the plot, and the results are delicious. The movie never gets old. It is an emotional roller-coaster. The beauty, the heartbreak, the fighting, is all so amazing.

21 July 2023,"""Gladiator"" - A Cinematic Triumph of Epic Proportions","""Gladiator,"" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2000, is an epic historical drama that stands as a testament to the grandeur and power of cinema. With its awe-inspiring visuals, compelling storytelling, and a tour de force performance from Russell Crowe, the film transports audiences to the ancient Roman Empire, immersing them in a world of vengeance, honor, and redemption.

The story revolves around Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a valiant general and loyal servant of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Betrayed by the treacherous Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the power-hungry son of the Emperor, Maximus is forced into slavery and must fight as a gladiator to survive. Driven by a burning desire for revenge, Maximus becomes a symbol of hope and freedom to the oppressed people of Rome as he seeks justice for the atrocities committed against him and his family.

""Gladiator"" is a visual masterpiece, showcasing Ridley Scott's exceptional directorial skills. The battle sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, blending practical effects with seamless CGI to create epic and visceral combat scenes. The attention to detail in recreating ancient Rome is remarkable, capturing the opulence of the Colosseum and the majesty of the gladiatorial arenas.

At the heart of the film is Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning performance as Maximus. Crowe's commanding presence and emotional depth infuse the character with a rare combination of strength and vulnerability. Maximus's journey from a fearless general to a gladiator seeking vengeance is portrayed with nuance and intensity, making him one of the most memorable and iconic characters in cinematic history.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers a chilling performance as Commodus, portraying the character's inner turmoil and sadistic nature with aplomb. His dynamic with Maximus creates an engaging and complex conflict that drives the film's emotional core.

The supporting cast, including Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou as Juba, and Oliver Reed in his final role as Proximo, all deliver stellar performances that elevate the film's emotional resonance.

Hans Zimmer's epic and powerful musical score complements the film's grand scale, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments and elevating the film's already magnificent atmosphere.

The film's thematic exploration of honor, duty, and the quest for justice resonates with viewers, making it more than just a visually stunning action epic. The screenplay, written by David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson, weaves a compelling narrative that delves into the complexities of power, loyalty, and the human spirit.

If there is any criticism, it would be that some historical inaccuracies are present in the film. However, these artistic liberties do not detract from the overall impact of the story.

In conclusion, ""Gladiator"" is an epic cinematic triumph that remains a shining example of historical drama done right. With its breathtaking visuals, powerful performances, and emotional depth, the film continues to captivate audiences and earn its place as one of the greatest works in the genre. ""Gladiator"" is a visceral and moving experience that leaves an indelible mark on viewers, reminding us of the enduring power of storytelling in the world of cinema.",8
3 January 2001,GLADIATOR: THE STORY THAT TOUCHES THE HEART,"When I first saw this movie it reminded me of Braveheart. Then I thought to myself that this movie posses a quality that Braveheart does not. It possesses the quality that you get satisfaction at the end of the movie. In Braveheart you do not get satisfaction at the end and it is difficult to watch many times. I believe that that is the reason why Braveheart didn't do as well as Gladiator did in the box office but did win 5 Oscars. This movie is a work of art. The score complements the movie so well. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver the movie in music notes rather than words. Russell Crowe is great in the movie and reminds me alot of Richard Burton. He is an up and coming star who is destined 2 win an Oscar. Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a great performance worthy of an Oscar. The late Oliver Reed is outstanding. Reed seems to steal the scene that he is in from all the other actors because of his acting power. Ridley Scott delivers a classic film that will remain in our memory and our hearts. If you haven't seen this movie, please do, you will not regret it.

31 August 2021,Poor casting and dreary.,"Again Hollywood doesn't seem to care about appropriate casting.....just name recognition.....in essence they're saying to the audience....eat! It could have been an exciting and historically important view into the Roman past.....but what we ultimately get is a puffy Australian actor with depression as his main mental state.

24 May 2000,Better than Ben Hur? Indeed it is.,"This is the first Roman epic for many years, so many were ready to rip into it, with comparisons to Ben Hur and Spartacus awaiting.

First things first, this easily holds up to the aforementioned epics, whilst surpassing them in several areas (the realism for one). Secondly, it puts Russell Crowe into the running for the ""real man"" roles that Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson are getting too old for.

The whole cast come off looking well, especially given the fact that there were only 35 pages of useable script. Add to that the fact that from those pages, Ollie Reed and Richard Harris would still refuse to use some of the dialogue because they didn't like it. Much of the script was done in situ. A Roman epic as done by John Cassavetes?

The only sticking point (performance-wise) was the occasionally hamminess of Joaquin Phoenix's Emperor Commodus (given that his name is also used to refer to a toilet, he's forgiven). He more than makes up for this by being very effective the rest of the time (thus he only rates a 0.2 on the Ustinov scale of hammy scenery chewing).

The action scenes are stunning, easily outdoing Ben Hur's justly famed chariot race. Crowe comes off best here, though only just - his whole performance carries the film. With a presence you can't fail to be pulled in by, Crowe scythes through armies and gladiators alike, becoming a firm crowd favourite along the way.

As with Spartacus, the events here are based on real Roman history. The two Marcus Aurelius and Commodus were previously portrayed by Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer respectively, in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).

One final note. Rest in piece Ollie. A comeback would have been welcome judging by the performance he gave here.",9
17 May 2000,A Riveting Movie,"Chances are you know something of this movie, and have heard the excellent reviews for it. This is largely to the fact that, as a summer epic, ""Gladiator"" is a very watchable and entertaining movie, delivering all the big-time action some want to see, while still maintaining a level of clean dialogue and plot to spark the interest of the more discerning viewer.

Russell Crowe, as the hero Maximus, is very good. He is excellent at playing the outraged but moral good guy stuck in a position he can do nothing about (a la L.A. Confidential), and he is brawny enough to pull off the action hero look.

I especially liked Joaquim Phoenix here. The part he plays, the new Caesar Commodus, is partially based on fact (unlike the entirely fictional Maximus). He's the only one here who really manages to convey the sense of decadence and depravity that pervaded the upper classes of Roman society during its decline. In my mind, Phoenix stole every scene he was in.

There are a couple problems. For one, director Ridley Scott (who did Alien, amongst others) concentrates more on heads getting chopped off then what could have been a rather engaging plotline, which is reduced to the bare points necessary to drive the action. This movie also falls into the ridiculous assumption Hollywood always seems to make that the upper class of any society has a British accent; it may not be a huge deal, but it's a pet peeve, and it makes no sense. Why would there be any particular accent? The battle scenes, while exceedingly bloody, are also a bit contrived, and don't seem real at all. Scott also makes some incredibly obvious attempts at symbolism using background colors that no one will miss, and it loses some significance because it's just so obvious.

All in all, this was a very good movie. It was fun to watch, and I was entertained for 2 1/2 hours. The combination of action, good acting, and semi-intriguing plot makes this a shining example of the blockbuster epic, sure to entertain just about anyone.",8
20 January 2006,Disappointing,"What a disappointment.

Predictable, bad cutting, bad voice recording.

Suited only for a 4 part TV-series.

I have seen much better historic cinemas on TV also with Derek Jacobi.

The battle against the German barbarians was quite unnecessary as it added nothing to the plot.

The only okay was the formation of Roman troops.

The clothes was also fine.

All in all a low level entertainment movie.

I am glad I did not pay to see it.

The start is way to slow and the movie should have been paced up and quicker.",4
2 May 2000,This movie by far is worth the money,"This movie by far is worth the money I thought I'd like this but not this much I mean Russel Crowe wow what an actor. He is one of the best actors of the new age he knows how to pick movies. This is the best movie of the year by far for it's great camera work visual effects and acting I can't praise enough how good Russell Crowe is in this movie go see you'll like it.

24 February 2001,Do they come any better?,"Ridley Scott may have a up & dn past; this time he hit the 'bullseye'. This movie is just getting better each time I see it; the first time was not enough. This is probably (so far) the best movie I've ever seen; but it takes a 50-60 inch screen with a really good sound system to appreciate all the work that has gone into this film! THANKYOU Ridley!

18 October 2001,Nice Tale of the Roman Empire,"This is yet another successful film starring Russell Crowe, who has turned in some of the most versatile acting performances in the past decade, including ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Insider"", and ""L.A. Confidential"". This film is a well-paced, action-packed (if not always realistic) film. What my wife liked about it (of which I'd have to agree) is that it is simple in its plot, very easy to follow, yet is never lacking in the right amount of action or momentum. It is a summer-movie¬Ö but a well-made summer movie. I'm not sure that I would have voted this for the Best Picture Oscar it received (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" had more depth and ""Almost Famous"" was very witty), but I certainly can't say it was a bad choice. This is definitely worth a look at least once.

14 May 2000,two movies for the price of one,"There is the drama, very Shakespearean in nature, with the complexities of power, betrayal, loyalty, love of king, family and country; and then there is the action. The movie has the feel of a committee behind it. The screenplay probably didn't specify too much about the battles, both military and gladiatorial, and somebody along the way probably decided that that the movie was too sophisticated and dramatic to sell without a lot of violence. The battles and fights are not particularly ingenious. I was never grossed out to the degree I had hoped for; I was rarely in suspense, and I didn't find the action to be specific enough. I wasn't always sure what specifically was happening in a fight. The violence didn't measure up to the politics in the drama. That said, the drama was fine, and Joaquin Phoenix held his own as the evil Commodus, and Mr. Crowe will get another crack at an Oscar. The story, by the way, is a flight-of-fancy, taking off from the more boring history, which is that Marcus Aurelius chose Maximus over his own son, Commodus, to rule Rome, but Commodus had Maximus (and his brother Condianus) assassinated after an early attempt was made on his life, orchestrated by his jealous sister Lucilla. Lucilla was exiled (later killed) and many suspected enemies (Maximus among them) were also assassinated. That wouldn't have made a very good movie, so we start by having Maximus show disrespect for Commodus on his first day in office, which causes Commodus to have him assassinated, the attempt of which he escapes miraculously. Lucilla remains in the story as a weak, sniveling (possibly incestuous) hanger on, and the historical fact that she was a power hungry conniver herself is conveniently excluded so that she can stay in the story till the end. In real life, Commodus was finally poisoned by a favorite concubine (Marcia) with the assistance of the palace staff, who were all afraid that they might be next in Commodus's paranoid rampage of executions. In addition, Gibbon (Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire) tells us that Commodus was much like Caligula in his taste both for assassinating his potential enemies and for orgies with both boys and women. That sexual side was not in the movie. I sorely longed for Bob Guccione's presence. Finally, only a small reference is made to the fact that Commodus fancied himself a great gladiator, calling himself the Roman Hercules. His servants concocted fixed ""battles"" with (drugged) wild beasts and (drugged or disabled) gladiators that he would always win. The crowd, according to Gibbon, found this display of vanity a bit annoying, but the thing that made the people really mad was that he was simply killing too many people. People will tolerate a lot from an emperor, but not the possibility that they will be his next victim.",8
28 December 2000,"Pretty good movie, but far from great.","I perhaps had too high of expectations for this film. I am a big Russell Crowe fan and the hype surrounding this movie was rather positive. However, whenever you see Ridley Scott's name as director, you should have reservations. I feel that Scott is right up there with Jerry Bruckenheimer in the making of MTV video movies. The stories tend to have some style and little substance. In Gladiator you get that style, but sadly, very little substance. Although Crowe was very good, that is no great feat, Crowe is always good. The problem with this movie was the real lack of supporting players. Phoenix was rather one dimensional and Oliver Reed was dead, literally. Perhaps I am being too negative, the movie is certainly entertaining and worth the rental, but it is not Spartacus, not even close. You want to see some kick butt fighting, check it out, but there are few Oscar clips here. Perhaps I should be more complimentary, it was Ridley Scott!

21 September 2023,The general who became a slave and became a gladiator,"Over the years, many films have been made about the Roman Empire, one better than the other of course. For example, in the 60s we already got to see the great spectacle Spartacus by director Stanley Kubrick, a film that actually looks a lot like Gladiator in terms of story and structure. At the helm is now Ridley Scott, a director who had long proven himself when Gladiator came out with films such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982) and of course Thelma & Louise (1991) with which Scott got his first Oscar nomination for Best Director, but unfortunately saw him pass by Jonathan Demme for The Silence of the Lambs. With Gladiator, Scott again received a nomination for Best Director, but for the second time Scott saw him pass him by, because this time director Steven Soderbergh ran away with it for his direction of the film Traffic, which was even nominated 2 times in the same category that year. This time Scott really deserved the statue and over the years Gladiator will also ring more of a bell to people than the movie Traffic. Gladiator was grand, epic and in fact there had never been such an intense film in the entire film history as Gladiator. The general who lost everything and who became a gladiator as a slave.

In the lead we see Russell Crowe as Maximus, a role that Crowe managed to deliver his first and only Oscar statuette. Yet it was Joaquin Phoenix who deserved the statue more but still missed it. Phoenix plays the role of Commodus. Commodus finds out that his father Caesar Marcus Aurelius does not intend to hand over power to him, but to his general Maximus in order to return power to the people of Rome in order to make it a republic again. Commodus kills his father and orders not only to kill Maximus, but also to slaughter his family. Phoenix them down that role in such an intensely hateful way that you really hate it with all your heart. Because in addition to the tyrant, Commodus is also a cowardly dog and above all a crybaby, who knows how to enjoy other people's suffering to get his own comforts. Phoenix was therefore the only actor who was the only choice in advance for Ridley Scott to play Commodus. It turned out to be really no coincidence, because if you look at the achievements that Phoenix has made as an actor over the years, you can only conclude that Phoenix is a very gifted actor, who is allowed to join a small brilliant group.

No matter how good Gladiator is, there are a number of big blunders in the film and it is quite special that those mistakes are still in the current film. A longer version of Gladiator has been released, but even that still contains the errors. The most striking and nasty mistake the film has is in the arena of the Colosseum, where Maximus and his gang of gladiators have to compete against enemies who go to battle with horse and carriage in the arena. When a chariot turns upside down and slides through, you see a cloth shooting up and underneath it there is really extremely clearly visible a gas bottle. But also someone with sunglasses between the spectators, or visibly modern houses that can be seen through the crevices of the 'are you not entertained' scene, are quite bad for such an expensive film of this size and with such a great director at the helm. Especially with the 4K release, I really expected that a director like Scott, just like George Lucas did with Star Wars over the years, would have taken these mistakes out of the film. Now there are many more of these kinds of mistakes in the movie that I haven't noticed (yet), but every time I see the gas bottle it ruins part of the movie for me. Fortunately, not enough not to put the film on a pedestal for the rest.

For me, the most impressive scene from the film remains the fight that the Romans have against the Germans. The preparation, in which the soldiers prepare for a tough battle and the tension that comes with it is really of an unprecedented level. All this is assisted by the brilliant soundtrack made by grandmaster Hans Zimmer. Zimmer combines grotesque classical music with Spanish influences, such as the constantly recurring Spanish guitar. During the battle with the Germans, Zimmer manages to bring the scene to unprecedented heights with insane music, in which the Spanish guitar is almost an octave higher than the rest of the music at one point. But the opening music, in which Maximus goes through the choir field with his hand, is also brilliantly done both cinematographically and musically. Gladiator is actually a fusion of image and music to perfection, something that for me personally is only better done in Interstellar (where the soundtrack is also by Hans Zimmer) and Once Upon a Time in the West (by Ennio Morricone).

Gladiator is one of the best, it's not THE best film ever made about the Roman Empire. The film has a perfect combination of cinematography and music, with the sounds being provided by none other than Hans Zimmer. Russell Crowe may be putting down one of the very best roles of his entire career as Maximus, but it's really Joaquin Phoenix who steals the show as Commodus and it's actually outrageous that Phoenix didn't get an Oscar for this. Anyway, the story is well put together, only the creators should have pay a little closer attention to the many visual film errors that the film has. The strange thing is that during the 23 years that the film is old, the errors have still not been removed from the film, while an extended version of Gladiator has been released that lasts more than 20 minutes longer than the original. If everything continues, the long-awaited Gladiator 2 will be in theaters next year, where we will continue to follow the life of Lucius. Whether this is such a good idea, let's go in the middle and we'll see, but one thing is certain and that is that Gladiator is really pure old gold.",10
13 November 2000,Overrated.,"Impressive battle scenes don't quite make up for the lame story in this blockbuster. It is impossible to find one believable character among the lot. Connie Nielsen, however, is very easy on the eyes. It's a pity to see a great cast like that struggle to find a shred of personality in their characters to work with.

25 June 2005,I didn't bother to see this movie sooner because...,"Frankly, I had seen enough blood guts and gore, after that ridiculous portrayal of Joan of Arc. I think if I had of watched it when released I would've not been in a frame of mind to comment with any intelligence.

Maximus, as portrayed by Russ, is somewhat of a complex character. Deeply loyal to his Emperor,( Richard Harris) Stirling performance.. with a sense of true dignity, and leadership. He is, the complete opposite of Joaquin Phoenix, and that is what makes this movie so very compelling. One is a total Monster, ( brilliant performance by Phoenix) and the other by contrast A Genteel Warrior. I could care less about the rest of the props, support cast etc, except those gorgeous cats, Maximus ( Crowie) just draws you in, IMHO and that's the thing that makes movies watchable, enjoyable and plausible, whether based on fact or fiction. I gave it a NINE vote, only because...I was annoyed that he died. :):)

30 December 2000,good but could of been better,"This is a very good movie. I viewed it at home and I imagine it would be even more majestic on the big screen with a tub of popcorn in hand and my shoes sticking to the floor.

Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is very believable as your typical schizo, paranoid Caesar with a flair for incest. I think he drank too much of the Roman water or maybe it was just a case of when in Rome do as the Romans. Hey, you look kinda cute, sis. Richard Harris's character as the old Caesar is a little too soft for me. I realize he is old, but hey, its good to be king. He was a little too touchy feely, but Harris salvages it and reels you in.

The look and feel of the movie is awesome and the story is superb. The story reminded me a lot of Braveheart with a few different twists. Braveheart stuck in a different world. Unlike Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Crowe does not give a quick glimpse of his gluteus maximus. I guess that is not his trademark. By the way, in my mind thats a big plus for the movie.

I scored this movie an 8. A disappointing 8. Why? Maybe because I was expecting a 9 or maybe even a 10. Why did it not deliver? I expected more true history, I guess. The gladiator's contests were too choreographed. The violence sometimes fit in the movie like hair in your chewing gum. Can't get it out, but it definitely does not belong there. Many of the fights were very good and others were like Jackie Chan and sword meets the gladiator. The one that comes to mind is when Maximus has 2 swords and stabs them into his foe. Not bad, pretty cool, very Romanesque. Then he draws them out, twirls them around and does a double sword decapitation of the poor soul. He must have worked at Beni Hana as a table chef. I was waiting for him to spit some tobacco, go into a back flip followed by a chinese split and remark, ""I'll be back"". machomus maximus ridiculous! I like the gladiator type fighting in Conan the Barbarian much better. I think when guys fight to the death you may see a little fear, more frantic fighting, and maybe even some biting or spitting and maybe even a little begging. You know, the way you would act if a snake crawled in your bed at night. A fast pace.

The tigers were real healthy looking and for some reason I always thought they used lions. The contestants entered the arena very elaborately sometimes and so did the feline carnivores. Maybe thats the way it was; I don't know.

Don't get me wrong this is still a very good movie. If you like a little tussle in the coliseum mixed with some emotional stuff then rent it. I may even buy it some day. I say, a big thumbs up, let the movie live.",9
22 October 2001,Hounsou and old actors made the film,"I think this is a fairly overhyped project,judging by the nominations and awards it got.Russell Crowe's performance was solid,but no way big enough for an AA(academy award).Connie Nielsen overplayed her part and fluked it for most of the film.Phoenix was ok at first,but became more and more tense and uncomfortable in his role.

No,the biggest credit should be given to the wonderful work of Djimon Hounsou and old british actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.They made me enjoy the film,much more than any battle scene or interplay between Crowe and Nielsen.Reed specially should have been given an oscar,posthumously that is.Djimon Hounsou has made a reputation with this film which will last long.And this is a marvel he has to look proud at.So,my 7 goes to him.

17 January 2001,"Booom, this movie explodes!","Once again you can count on Ridley Scott to direct a bloody masterpiece! That's right, it's bloody and it's a masterpiece. I'm sorry I sound like a salesman but that's what happens when you're excited about the brilliance of a movie. If you havent' seen it yet take this as a que, it's in the video rentals so you have NO excuse not to see it! The acting was amazing. I don't care what anyone says I think Joaquin Phoenix did the best job as Commodus. He was so awesomely convincing, I would easily say he played the best villian since Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Besides that, everyone else also acted flawlessly in their roles. This is definitely Oliver Reed's best performance ever, unfortunately his last. Besides that, the movie was so convincing, I have seen many movies who's settings are ancient rome, none of them did it as well as Gladiator did. The clothes, the palace, the battles, and most of all, the Colliseum are completely captivating. You wanna see a good movie that EVERYONE will love, this is the one, get it now!

14 May 2012,My Favorite Movie!,"Gladiator is by far one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything about this movie is perfect. No complaints whatsoever. What was there to complain about? The entire cast was perfect. Russell Crowe was awesome!! He plays a fantastic Roman who wants revenge for the meaningless death of his wife and son. Yet, as much as I loved Russell Crowe in this movie, I find that Joaquin Phoenix's performance was just a little bit better. Phoenix has such amazing talent and I was really upset when he didn't end up winning the Academy Award for this performance. Also, Connie Nielsen was also very good and made a perfect Roman princess. Great movie and so worth the time. It is my favorite movie and one I will continue to watch over and over again.

9 July 2000,Not terrible.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6

22 May 2000,Disappointed by overrated Gladiator,"Way overrated - despite great acting (Phoenix is surprising, while Crowe is expectedly excellent) & nice effects with the Roman architecture & look, the over-serious style tries to be Saving Pvt. Ryan meets Julius Caesar & fails at both. Wooden dialogue, clunky narrative, & boring pace don't help, but worst of all are the Michael Bay-like action scenes - too many edits to make sense! Ridley Scott continues to show that his only strengths are coming up with nice-looking films, but can't tell much of a story or emotional weight without an exceptional script. C+

When Maximus escapes the execution he flees home to Spain but is too late his wife and his son have been killed and his house and property burnt to the ground by Roman generals ordered by the new emperor (commodus).

Maximus is captured and sold as a slave in Carthage to a wealthy man Proximo and is ordered to fight as a gladiator.As his love by the crowd rises he's brought to Rome to fight at the Colleseum.For the entertainment of the new emperor.

Maximus comes to Rome and begins to seek revenge for his family's murders.

This is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack,excellent acting,magnificent direction by Ridley Scott and amazing special effects.This one of my favourite movies of all time and if Peter Jacksons movies and George Lucas' had not come along i would be saying that this is probably the best of the 21st century so far.

Go watch this masterpiece of a movie one of the best of its kind.

26 May 2000,"Excellent movie, unfortunate that the General misses human emotions.","This movie left me with the expression of just one man: The Gladiator. The rest I forgot as soon as the credit titles began. I was impressed and that says a lot for someone who sees about three movies every two weeks in the past years. When I think about what impresses me about this character, who is actually just an ordinary hero, almost invincible, who can slaughter six man in a few seconds without blinking his eyes... what made this character so different, then I come to the conclusion: his modesty. Never before I have seen a Man this Great and yet so modest. And because THAT is what makes this movie so special, what leaves you with feelings of admiration for this Great General (`It's just a movie!', you keep telling yourself), the choice of Russell Crowe as actor seems excellent. However, this movie could have been so much better, if only Crowe would have shown more humanity. What I miss is (emotional) pain: what this man did go through in his live should have left marks in his face, in his eyes that saw more then an ordinary man can bare. Unfortunately, in this respect his character is rather flat, emotion-less almost. That makes him not-so-human, and therefore touches the spectator less deep in his heart. Too bad; not perfect, but still excellent.",8
13 May 2000,"""Gladiator"" Is A Perfect Ten","""Gladiator"" is a film that should suit all tastes. It is expertly mounted and an eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and ""Might for Right"". I was reminded of ""Camelot"" many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with. My one worry is that this film will reinvent him from ""gifted actor"" to the next ""Hollywood Hunk"". I've watched other mercurial, vastly talented actors, like Mel Gilbson and Alec Baldwin, sell out to beefcake roles, and I'm praying Crowe doesn't fall under the same spell. Although his work in ""Gladiator"" is a tour de force performance, he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen. It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeded expectations in that regard. My hope is that he continues adding to his extraordinary body of work, rather than ""selling out"". Take my word for it, he'll be the next ""Mel Gibson/Alec Baldwin/""People"" Magazine's Sexiest Man on Earth if he isn't careful. Want to take a trip along side a great actor? Watch ""The Sum of Us"", or even ""The Insider"", and then immediately go out to see ""Gladiator"". In all cases you'll witness a great actor doing his job extremely well.",10
30 March 2001,"great on the eye, awful on the ear","oooohhh it looks just lovely, Rome is awesome and the set pieces, the opening fight scene and the gladatorial combat are fantastic to look at. But then it is spoiled by people opening their mouths. Not because they all have really bad teeth, but because someone should have taken the time to come up with a good script for Ridly Scott to do something with.

As ever Mr. Scott proves what a gifted director he is with great visual flair, but again he is poorly served with material that is all mouth and no trousers. And as for the performance by Joauqin Phoenix, well to say he was overacting his role as a madman would be to insult the undisputed title holder of overacting madmen, the one, the only Brad Pitt.

It's not bad, but how anybody could say that this is a better film than the simply sublime 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' proves how little taste there is in the world and how unfortunately good guys so often don't get what they deserve.",4

13 February 2006,"Crowe wins big as Maximus in ""Gladiator""","Russell Crowe earns high marks for his performance as Maximus in the heavily Oscar nominated ""Gladiator"". With a superb supporting cast consisting of Joaquin Phoenix, late Oliver Reed, Connie Neilsen, Richard Harris, & Djimon Hounsou, ""Gladiator"" quickly vaulted Crowe to super stardom. The brutal battle scenes, background shots of the countryside in Rome, the costumes & weaponry, & the gladiator fights exceeded all expectations. Ridley Scott's masterpiece of film-making will stand the test of time & should be used in film schools to teach students effective film direction.

""Gladiator"" chronicles the story of Maximus(Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband & father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar(Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous & scheming son Commodus(Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power & envy of his father's love for Maximus. I could go on but I would be giving away too much.

To make a long story short, Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife & son to murder by Commodus' minions, & becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area. Maximus exacts his revenge on Commodus in the end but pays a heavy price. Maximus soon is reunited with the ones he loves most, his lovely wife & son.

There are no disappointments to report with ""Gladiator"" other than to say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was not his best performance of late. He does get back on track later in ""Ladder 49"" which suited him much better. All in all, a very good film with beautiful cinematography & background music as well. So, grab your snack & beverage from the kitchen & enjoy this soon-to-be classic. And hey, thumbs up!!!",8
10 January 2001,Classic!,"A superb film (though one might argue with the ending resolution)... Crowe is outstanding and dominates both the story and the screen. Through tone, gesture, glance he is able to make of his character a veritable Force of Nature....absolute, intractable, implacable. When the film is at its best (and it is consistently at its best) you can feel the sand of the Coliseum under your feet! Truly a classic worth many repeated viewings.

1 June 2000,"For a 2.5 hour show, it could have been longer. Great entertainment.","Right from the start, this film strikes you as special with a scene that, if it is meant as an intro, looks like the finale of most other films. The special effects, although hugely impressive, do not take over the story which is simplistic but powerful. How Roman life was at that time is about as graphically illustrated as you would like to see but in more than a violent manner. The roles, and particularly the actors, especially Russell Crowe, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, enrich the film to their credit. Altogether, miss this one on the big screen, and you'll never really see it again.

6 May 2000,A very good film to start the summer...,"The first of the summer blockbusters finally arrives, and if it is any indication of what the summer will be like, this will be a great year for movies.

Gladiator tracks the career of a Roman general named Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from grace after Emperor Marcus Aurelius dies and is succeeded by his son, Commodus. Maximus finds himself in the arena fighting as a gladiator, trying to gain revenge for the murder of his family.

Ridley Scott's direction is simply inspired, and he is able to bring stellar performances out of his actors. Further, the art direction and computer imaging brings the ancient Roman world to life more vividly than any film before it.

Perhaps one truly great trick that Ridley Scott pulls out of his book is to turn the theatre audience into Romans. I personally found myself excited as the blood spilled onto the floor in the arena, much to my horror (I have always considered myself peaceful and civilized). One comes out of the theatre with a sense that perhaps one isn't quite as far from the brutality of the past as we all would hope.

If I have any complaint, it is that some of the combat scenes move too fast and have too much going on. The end result is that the viewer doesn't quite know what is happening. Perhaps the clarity of the battles in Braveheart would have been more helpful here.

So, the final score: 4.5/5. Definitely worth going to see.",9
19 July 2006,"RIDLEY SCOTT WORKS FOR ""PIXAR FOR ""SOME"" ADULTS"" (no naked ladies etc.)","I think this movie can best described as Blood and Guts"" with super duper computer generated graphics. Displaying ancient Rome as a Beautful cesspool with mobs to be appeased but not a hint of nudity or sex to speak of, is unfair to us, the Romans and filmmakers. ALso this flick makes absolutely no effort to reflect any of the actual history of the period and does not come close to showing the Insanity of Commodus.

As a fantasy flick its pretty good and I recommend ""Fall of the Roman Empire, The (1964)"" which covers the same ground withs it own version of history but with Sophia Loren as Livius and slightly more skin/

Just watched this movie, again, in 2009 and 2006 comments still correct.

6 August 2002,I've seen this movie before...,"It seems as if the folks at DreamWorks could not decide whether they wanted to remake ""Ben Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" or ""The Fall of the Roman Empire,"" so they decided to remake all three. They took two awesome scripts and one mediocre screen play, stuck them in a blender, and the resulting concoction has become the better-than-average ""Gladiator."" It borrows most heavily from the mediocre ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" in terms of characters and basic plot, but quite a bit of influence from ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" can easily be noted.

This is the story of Mad Maximus (Russell Crowe), an Australian who moves to Spain, looks good in a toga and so becomes general of the Roman army. Unfortunately, he refuses to kiss the behind of emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), because he's a bit upset that Commodus killed his own father and Max's best friend Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). One bad thing leads to another, and old Mad Max finds himself mixed up with an international cast of characters fighting as gladiators in the Peoria of North Africa. Soon the day of their big break comes, and it's out of Peoria and on to the Hollywood and Broadway of the ancient world: Rome; to play games of life in death before tremendous crowds at the biggest theater in the world: the Coliseum.

Many find the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome to be rather savage and brutal; but you have to give the Romans a break, in that Hollywood, video games and ice hockey had not yet been invented. What else is there to do for entertainment other than watch a bunch of strangers poke and stab each other with sharp objects? Sure, Playstation II has better blood & gore graphics, but several centuries of technological advancement will do that for you. In the old days, the blood and gore of the arena was all that was available.

But an interesting twist develops in the plot: Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) finally realizes after thirty years that her brother is a sick, unrepentant pervert and lunatic. Some are slow learners. So she decides that the ol' gladiator/general Mad Max might be just the guy to help her submarine her bro, and restore peace, justice and the American Way to Rome.

Anyone who has seen ""Ben Hur,"" ""Spartacus"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" has already seen this movie. There's no surprises or suspense, just lots more scenes of people being decapitated and/or disemboweled. It's amazing what special effects artists and CGI have been able to do to help bring brutality into a far more realistic light than in the past --chalk up another great moment for Hollywood.

In the hands of most directors, a film like this would be the scorn and bird droppings of most film critics. But DreamWorks had an ace up their sleeve: they got Ridley Scott to direct this train wreck of a script, and then work his incredible magic to make the ugly duckling transform into a beautiful swan. Well Ridley is good, but he's not God, so what we end up with is a swan who's kinda cute, but not quite up to the cover of Sport Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Still, this is far more than most could have done with such muck.

Ridley Scott is one of the few directors who the word ""genius"" sticks to like glue. You've seen what this guy can do, and do better than most anyone else. For the movie ""Gladiator"", Scot goes all out. He gets the BEST actors, the best set and costume designers, and the best composer, then puts it all together and creates a tremendous feast for the eyes & ears. There are many great performances all throughout this picture, and the camera work and art direction are absolutely top notch.

If there is a complaint, it is with the fight sequences. They are the typical fast cut/shakey camera mish mash that's been going on for ages. One minute a group of guys are facing one another, the next minute a whole bunch of them are dead. How did it happen? Who knows, who cares. Instead of carefully staged shots and fluid camera work, we get the cinema equivalent of projectile vomit. Oh well, at least I can always put on ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Phantom Menace"" if I want to see sword play done properly, or the Tyrone Power version of ""Zorro"" (1940). But I will admit that the battle scene between the Germans and the Romans at the very beginning of the film was extremely well done. The fast cuts and bouncy camera did an excellent job conveying the excitement and confusion that is prevalent in large scale combat.

The actors and the performances they give are far too good for a film of such tripe. Of particular note is the performance of Lucilla by Connie Nielsen. The film is worth the price of admission (or the price of the DVD) just to see this woman's face light up the screen and give the over used theme of blood vengeance such dignity, poise and grace. Lucilla is by far the most interesting character of the film, for she is the only one who goes through a process of transformation by means reflection and examination, rather than by forced external entanglements. The characters of Commodus and Maximus could have been easily played by cardboard cut-outs with the words ""Bad Guy"" and ""Good Guy"" stenciled on each. What you see of Commodus and Maximus in the first ten seconds of film is what you see in their final scenes, there is no change or awakening in these two guys. But Lucilla rewards us with an interesting sort of redemption that makes a rather predictable film worth watching. As Ridley Scott himself said of Ms. Nielsen: ""She can rule my empire anytime.""

My generous rating: 7/10",7
3 November 2003,Good solid movie,"Not one of the all-time greats, but certainly one of the all-time pretty-darn-goods. Solid acting from almost everyone. Perfectly fitting soundtrack. Well balanced dynamics (action versus silence versus dialogue). Highlights for me were the later interactions between Caesar and his sister - in particular the busy bee tale and later the only time he really raises his voice at her.

Visually, it's a little monotone, but there's good use of space by the director - the claustrophobic scenes give you that sense of discomfort and the more open scenes can be quite airy.

Violence levels were expected to be high, so there's no point in anyone complaining about that, you have all the warning you need before you've ordered the ticket.

24 August 2013,Epic,"I've seen this movie countless times and am pretty sure I'll re-watch it many more times. Needless to say, it's one of my all time favorite movies, and I believe it deserves all the popularity, awards and positive comments. Gladiator brings you all that you can possibly expect from its genre. It takes you to a different time and place and tells an epic fairy tale of a true hero. Director does justice to the plot and characters make the story proud. Russell Crowe is exceptionally great in this film with pure talent and amazing chemistry with his character, and in fact the whole cast seems perfect. All in all, this is a movie I'd gladly recommend to anyone without a doubt. It really is a classic of our time.

25 May 2000,Not one of Ridley's best,"If you don't like this film after the first half hour you'd better leave and save yourself another hour or two - it goes on & on and doesn't improve with age. This is an epic with no heart and soul - lots of oh-so-evil bad guys and goody-two-shoes, sweetness & light nice guys. You don't feel much for anyone in it, unlike other modern 'epics' like Braveheart, and computerized SFX or not, it can't hold a candle to the likes of Ben Hur/Spartacus etc. In fact, even the effects are not really all that impressive - and if the acting and script had been better I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I had so much time on my hands that I started trying to guess where the 'real' actors and sets stopped and the 'virtual' ones started. It's not quite like Titanic - the effects are not so impressive, and the acting is nowhere near as awful - but it does unfortunately come to mind. Still, at least go & see it in a decent theatre, it will shrivel away to nothing on the small screen.

It's hard to describe, but it's noticeably when you view them. The natural reverb of the theater made it difficult to understand some of the movie, but I still found myself enjoying this movie.

Fuzzy, muddy, indistinct? I don't think so. Practically every scene in this film is beautifully shot, and looks like it could be turned into a painting. From the contrast of fire against the dark woods in the beginning, to the fights in the Coliseum , this film looks amazing. The cgi people weren't going for stark realism, but a very stylized look and I believe it works. If you look at the Coliseum the first row of people is real, and the second is cgi, and for the life of me I couldn't tell the difference. Since everyone seems intent on comparing this to Braveheart, I'll do the same. To put it simply, it makes Braveheart's cinematography look amateurish by comparison.

On top of the amazing cinematography, you have a completely immersive score. I never found it cheesy or manipulative, and I HATE manipulative scores (for example: Braveheart).

What can I say about the story? It's a simple revenge story, but that really doesn't matter because the execution is so masterful. It's about death and redemption. My only complaint is that it seemed like some of the plot was cut out to make this more of a summer movie. I'm sure the dvd will fix the situation, though. Is this completely historically accurate? Of course not, and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a fictional tale, told in a historical setting. Demanding 100% historical accuracy from a movie that doesn't claim to be historically accurate is absurd and unfair.

Overall, though, I don't really care what other people think about this movie. To me it is a work of art.",8
9 May 2000,"What, is it autumn already?","""Gladiator"" is being hyped as the first blockbuster of the summer movie season, which is rather strange, as it hardly exudes what could be described as a summery feeling. Ridley Scott's sword-clanging historical drama boasts plenty of July-style blood and thunder, but it's powered by a dark, brooding emotional tone that makes it feel more like a serious October release than like summer popcorn fun.

Set in 180 A.D., the film centers around Maximus (Russell Crowe), a powerful Roman general in the army of Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who plans to give Maximus control of Rome upon his death so the great city's long-dead republican government may be restored. This infuriates Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Aurelius' actual son, so he kills his father, as well as Maximus' family, and plans to have the general executed. Maximus escapes, but is caught by slave traders and sold to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), who trains the former military man as a gladiator. Maximus, not surprisingly, is a prodigious fighter, and he and his fellow gladiators are called to Rome...where Commodus Caesar has ordered five months of games in honor of his dead father. Revenge (along with severed limbs) is soon heavy in the air.

This is a more intricate story than is common for popcorn cinema, and admittedly, it is handled fairly well. However, the story is essentially a framework for some impressive set pieces. I have always considered Ridley Scott a director of primarily visual gifts (his ""Blade Runner"", my all-time favorite science fiction film, is one of the very rare pictures where visual quality and subtext bear more weight than the plot itself), and here he delivers an immense and intriguing Rome which is always eye-catching and enjoyable to see. Cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates position themselves as early 2001 Oscar favorites with their work here. Unfortunately, the visual impression is marred somewhat by a few instances of ham-fisted editing, as well as a Hans Zimmer / Lisa Gerrard score which is frequently intrusive and ill-suited to the action onscreen.

There are many people, of course, who will be seeing ""Gladiator"" primarily for the arena battle sequences. Be warned: this is not your typical Teflon action stuff. Though visually striking, these scenes are shockingly gory and gruesome, and are not much fun to watch at all. Anyone who thinks boxing is too barbaric should watch this film, a record of an time in our history when cold-blooded murder was served up as public entertainment.

The screenplay, by David Franzoni, William Nicholson, and John Logan (who tackled modern-day gladiators of a different sort with his football epic ""Any Given Sunday""), does not improve on the dialogue of such sword-and-sandal forbears as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus""; the characters still express themselves with the same sort of Shakespeare Cliffs Notes verbal style. Fortunately, Scott's cast can out-act an army of Charlton Hestons. Harris and Reed are entertaining in their roles, and Djimon Hounsou exudes his typical effortless menacing charisma as one of Maximus' gladiatorial comrades. Among the supporting cast, Joaquin Phoenix is the major standout, making Commodus a perverted, cowardly man cursed to doom by a herculean inferiority complex. This is not a villain you'll love to hate. You'll just hate him.

Russell Crowe continues to impress as an actor, following his nervous, conflicted whistle blower in ""The Insider"" (a role which deservedly won him an Oscar nomination) with a convincing and nuanced portrayal of a man of principles trapped in a world of death-for-profit. He is commanding in the action sequences (I wouldn't want him coming at me with a sword) and enough of an actor to convey the strong, direct emotions that customarily drive a narrative of this type. It's nice that Hollywood has wised up to the usefulness of real ACTORS in these types of roles; picture Jean-Claude Van Damme as Maximus if you don't believe me.

I wouldn't exactly call it anyone's idea of summertime fun, ""Gladiator"" is nevertheless an interesting and well-made film which provides a fair share of good, if not always rousing, entertainment.",
5 May 2000,Is it autumn already?,"""Gladiator"" is being hyped as the first blockbuster of the summer moviegoing season, which is strange to me, as it doesn't exude a summery vibe at all. To be sure, Ridley Scott's high-tech update of the classic sword-and-sandal genre boasts plenty of July-style blood and thunder, but the picture also sports a grim, somewhat heavy mood that undercuts the thrills and gives the film the kind of brooding texture more commonly associated with prestige autumn and winter releases.

The story, set in 180 A.D., follows Maximus (Russell Crowe), a mighty Roman general who is selected by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to restore the republican government to Rome upon his death, at the expense of the Caesar's own ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). A furious Commodus kills his father, as well as Maximus' beloved wife and son, and condemns the general to death. Maximus escapes, but is captured as a slave and trained as a gladiator. Transformed into a brutal killing machine, he is returned to Rome...just in time for Commodus Caesar's gladiator festivities.

It's an engaging story, more intricate than is common for popcorn fare, and it's given appropriately serious treatment by Ridley Scott. Scott has always struck me as a director of primarily visual gifts (his ""Blade Runner"", my all-time favorite science fiction film, is one of very few pictures in which style and subtext really tell the story), and he serves up an always-convincing past here. Every detail, from the sprawling grandeur of the Roman Colosseum to the surprise of seeing female archers in combat in the ring, is eye-catching and enjoyable. The picture is great to look at, with cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates positioning themselves as early Oscar favorites with their work here. The same cannot be said for composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose stentorian score at times overwhelms the action. The film also features some choppy editing choices that deaden the drama at a couple of moments (the scene where Maximus discovers his dead family, for example, was marred for me but a jump-cut that threw me out of the moment).

Of course, there are many people who will be seeing the film primarily for its scenes of gladiatorial combat. They should be warned: this isn't your typical rousing action stuff. It's brutal, shockingly gory, and a bit chilling in the bloodlust it brings out in the citizens who sit back and cheer as men are dismembered and eviscerated. Anyone who thinks boxing is barbaric should watch this movie, a chronicle of a time when cold-blooded murder was something you paid money to watch for fun.

The screenplay, credited to David Franzoni, John Logan (who did his own modern-day gladiator story with last Christmas' football tale ""Any Given Sunday""), and William Nicholson, is relatively unremarkable in terms of its dialogue; they really haven't improved on the sort of slightly stilted Shakespeare Cliffs Notes speech Cecil B. DeMille got off on. Still, Scott's actors put it across with more conviction than an army of Charlton Hestons. Phoenix really impressed me with his Commodus; perverted, ambitious, and nursing a Herculean inferiority complex, he's a gripping villain. You don't love to hate him. You just hate him. Also impressive are Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial comrade and the late Oliver Reed, who exudes cynicism and faded glory as a former gladiator turned bloodsport merchant.

Front and center in all of this, of course, is Crowe, who impresses yet again with his versatility and control as a performer. Maximus is worlds away from the nervous, conflicted Jeffrey Wigand of ""The Insider"", the role that won Crowe an Oscar nomination earlier this year. This hero is solid, tough, and single-minded of purpose, a man who does what he's got to do to see justice done. Crowe's charisma and conviction carry the audience through the most ferocious of the bloodletting, and provides a strong force to compel the audience through the drama.

""Gladiator"" is a gritty, surprisingly serious melodrama, a story of blood and revenge which may not be a lot of people's idea of a fun way to spend a hot afternoon. Still, anyone with a taste for period cinema and classical old-fashioned storytelling will be in for a good, if not always rousing, experience.",
4 May 2000,above average but far from great -- a 6 out of 10,"Gladiator is an entertaining enough way to spend almost three hours, but it never manages to achieve the level of greatness that it so desperately aspires to. Russell Crowe as always adds a sure hand with his fine acting, but I felt the action scenes were a bit stagy.

Joaquin Phoenix never convinced me he was a man corrupted by ambition. It WAS nice though to see veteran actors Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed on the screen again.

All in all, a movie worth seeing, but don't expect greatness.

16 January 2001,At least 5 Oscars here!,"Oscars look out, here comes your new owners. The best movie of 2000 by ....a little bit. Green Mile was very special and will get its own set of oscars, but, for me too disturbing. Gladiator however sets up its story well, and runs its story cleanly to its conclusion. Russell Crowe suits his role excellently and the action sequences/CGI set new standards. Get this one , don't let the subject matter put you off, it is superb.

The action with gladiators and the war is breathtaking. It's only flaw is the runtime. The first quarter after the battle scene seems to drag on as the pace slows down however it recovers as the rest of the movie is excellent.

30 May 2000,"If you can stand the gore, it's a good movie","Seems to take liberties with some aspects of history, but is close enough that it's more accurate than most stuff coming out of Hollywood. The fight scenes are excellent and the fact that a man could do what the main character did seems impossible. The production was great with epic proportions and worthy of an Oscar.

The acting was good though at times fair. The power of the story and plot carries this movie. The scenes and confrontations are memorable and powerful. Russell Crowe did an excellent job convincing me he was who he was playing, but the best performance was put out by Oliver Reed. He was magnificent as the slave owner of the gladiators. I thought it was him when I first saw the character, but was not sure till the end credits as he protrayed the tough old gracious retired obviously successful gladiator of times gone by. The performances of the young emperor and his sister/concubine are not as powerful, but adequate. Richard Harris does a better than expected job as the old ceasar.

If one can handle Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart you can handle this movie, though one gladiator fight sequence may out do what was in those movies.",10
11 November 2012,Gladiator,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
7 April 2006,"Great directing, writing and acting","This movie is the best in the world I think. The great directing, writing and acting. Russell Crowe pulled off an amazing performance in the battles, lines(husband to a murdered wife)(what we do in life echoes in eternity).

Great battle sequences, at the start for example and at the end when gladiator battles the emperor. Great Movie, great landscapes, the great lines, acting and fight scenes.

The coliseum was terrific, with tigers coming out of holes in the ground. Violent, epic warfare was displayed greatly, there was the battle with the big guy with the nice helmet which I enjoyed the most.

29 October 2001,Simply Amazing!!,"Gladiator is quite simply one of the best movies ever made, and it deserved each of the 5 Academy Awards that it won. The story is brilliant, the acting is outstanding, and the soundtrack is perfect.

All of the acting performances are outstanding, but the most memorable performance is that of Russell Crowe. His performance here put him at the top of the Hollywood A-list, and he deserved the Best Actor award. He is riveting as Maximus, the Roman General who was betrayed. He was forced to become a slave, and then a gladiator. Some of the most memorable quotes come from the character of Maximus, such as 'My name is Gladiator'.

Another outstanding performance is that of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla.

The action scenes are well done, and extremely bloody, but this makes them more authentic.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.

Definately 10/10!",10

7 July 2000,Russell Crowe is Hollywood's new favourite actor!,"Gladiator is one of the most phenomenal movies you will see this year. With an excellent story and outstanding acting, Gladiator is definitely the most popular movie to come out in 2000. The true Roman culture and life of a gladiator is displayed through the eyes of Ripley Scott (the director). You will definitely feel as though you are Roman when this film is finished. With a powerful enemy and a damsel in distress, this clearly is one of those true action movies that almost runs along a Walt Disney storyline. During a survey for the best movie movie to be out yet this year, 89% of the votes were for Gladiator. It clearly shows that Gladiator is everything you've heard about in the reviews and comments from the IMDb users. This is a movie that if you don't like, I will be extremely shocked!

14 May 2000,The first Epic picture of the new Century - A MUST see,"I took my 11 year old daughter to this picture and both of us were speechless after it was over.You MUST see this on the big screen.. It will lose so much on a tiny TV when it is out on video!

This movie is Star Wars ..with real people.. in a galaxy near near and a time not so long ago. The audience (very sparse I might add) applauded wildly at the end of this picture.

My daughter said she liked it because she likes blood & gore (and there is a LOT of it).. but that is the way history paints these times. She did not grasp all the dialogue (you need to know a little about Roman times).. and was a little bored in the beginning.... but the plot grabbed her and after she refused to leave her seat even to get up to get a soda refill for fear she might miss something... Unusual!

The acting superb, script, action.. This movie is SO big you do have to see it twice..as I will... the second time to just sit back and relax.. and enjoy a first rate piece of movie making.... 9 stars out of 10...",9
9 September 2022,A true master piece,"A wonderful film that entertains from start to finish. The casting is perfect and the actors are bang on form. Stunning visuals through out, and a fast pace, which makes this long epic seem short.

I really like the ending, as it is satisfying, but is not the typical Hollywood ending, where everything is just perfect at the end.

The fight scenes are some of the most memorable and competent in film history. I would recommend this film to anyone.

I would love to see a prequel to Gladiator, telling the story of how Maximus became general, and his early relationship, with the emperor's children.

A true master piece.",10

Although, Joaquin Phoenix doesn't have Malcolm McDowell's mad edge as Commodus it doesn't matter. Connie Nielsen is regally sexy as Lucilla and Oliver Reed (who is almost unrecognizable as Proximo) is PHENOMENAL and his presence will be sorely missed.

9 February 2001,"Great Acting, average movie.","Well, this is a strange place I find myself in. I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and a big Russel Crowe fan. But the movie lacked in several areas. I think that the story itself was very powerful but it didn't translate that well to the screen. I'm not really sure whose fault that was but apparently I'm the only one that noticed it anyway. It also never got my blood pumping the way I think Ridley intended it to. The battles were poorly shot and hard to watch, especially on the small screen.

I must give credit where credit is due though. The film is very beautiful and the visual effects of Rome were very good. Russel Crowe was, as usual, amazing and Juaquin Phoenix stole the entire film away from even Richard Harris (I was very impressed).

Overall the film was watchable but lacked the epic part of an epic movie.

1 June 2000,"""The Mummy"" goes ""Asterix""","This movie isn't terrible. It is merely foolish.

It reminds me of ""The Mummy"". A genuine mediocre film who worked out fine in it's own premises. A little too much though from time to time. But quite alright. Nothing more, nothing less.

But - I was a little disappointed with Russel Crowe. He is a star in my eyes - a true actor. In this film he simply walks around with a goofy, bewildered expression on his face - and that's all the acting, he gives us. Joaquin Phoenix has a face of a villain. But he draws his Commodus over the line. Only Connie Nielsen shines truly like a star. She reminds me of Greta Scacchi at her peak - or even Vivien Leigh.

I gave it 5. It really doesn't deserve more. Or we will be granted a terrible sequel.

Good guys escape from death too much (forest scene). Please hollywood, give me something more like Die Hard where he comes out of the experience bruised and bloodied rather than just kick everyone's butts on his own in a matter of seconds and is pretty much unscathed.

If I personally were facing chariots, I would aim a little higher with my spear, you know, impale the guy guiding the horses instead of aiming for the wheels. Sheesh.

17 September 2006,"More than an action film, more than an historical spectacle.","This film is a must see for all lovers of cinema. Tightly scripted the characters come to life - you sense the actors have become the characters they portray.

The opening battle sequence is one of the best brought to the screen and I have seen Olivier's ""Henry V"", Kirk Douglas's ""Spartacus"" and Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"".

Ridley Scott's direction, not only captures the huge scope of the canvas, he has developed the personalities of the characters and permitted them to 'breathe' and become believable, depicting a range human qualities and deficiencies.

Russell Crowe's performance is so dominant (worthy of the ""Oscar"") one cannot imagine any other actor in the role. Joaquin Pheonix truly establishes himself as a fine actor and Connie Neilson, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed cannot be faulted.

I would recommend this film for anyone who loves a strong story line, fine acting and an appreciation of the cinematic art. You could not be disappointed with this film",10

18 May 2000,Two thumbs way up but only for second...I wouldn't want to lose them.,"I was reassured within the first five minutes of this film that Ridley Scott was present and accounted for. The opening battle scene was almost psychotronic in it's atmospherics...like a Roman version of Alien. Wow! I love this director. Russell Crowe has definitely arrived too. He takes charge immediately as a believable Maximus, a great general with character, courage and the loving loyalty of his men...men of one of history's greatest armies. (""When I give the signal, let loose hell."") This guy's an alpha-male with a capital alpha! The movie follows his destiny as he navigates the twists and turns of Roman politics, greed and power. He is betrayed by a vile dweeb, a dying Marcus Aurelius Ceasar's son, who orders Maximus and Max's wife and son killed. This succeeds for the family but Max escapes and is spun off on a Jean Valjean-like journey of redemption and obscured identity. Except instead of becoming a mayor, he becomes...you guessed it...a Gladiator. Apparently, he is a gifted scrapper and builds quite a reputation. He comes to Rome and settles up the score. Riveting. Engaging. Awesome. The acting is superb. The script is intelligent and marvelously credible considering the difficulty scriptwriters have with historical movies, at least as far as I'm concerned. And it is terrific history! Very accurate. This presupposes that I know some Roman history...well, of course, I do. It had some tragedy which my companion (my wife) always finds intollerable and of course I gave her my standard speech about how film is not always supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy but rather challenged and sometimes jolted. And as usual, it was hopeless. No way any movie gets an Oscar vote from my wife when kids get killed. However, she made me proud by brightly acknowledging that the violence was not gratuitous, in fact she said ""it was necessary to the advancing story arc and was done tastefully."" At this point, I felt some pride from how well she had learned her Film 101 lessons. In summary, I was glued to the screen for 150 or so minutes and I believe that I saw the best Ridley Scott has ever done...certainly a must see. This may not be a ""chick-friendly-flick"" although you never know.

The thing I like this film is that everything make sense,everything is believable!And I'm not talking about the historical exactness,I'm talking about the reasons that follows the characters through the movie. I can truly understand them,why they are doing this or that. Nobody is the perfect one,the best,the infallible. That makes the characters vivid and memorable. It gave you the opportunity to feel sad or happy about them. Besides Ridley Scott knows how to make a hero of a man,who's not a saint,who has flaws.And somehow it appears to be better this way...! Another thing I really like in ""Gladiator"" is the script. Powerful,wise,ironical(but only at the right places);not cocky,not exaggerating! These are the components for a good movie,I think! So,directors,make us believe in everything you present in your movies!

14 May 2000,"Spectacular, but shallow","There's no doubt that Gladiator looks great, and it's a fun movie to watch. Don't expect too much from the story though; there's nothing here that hasn't been done a hundred times (see Titus for a movie that does it better), played here in a way that was more reminiscent of professional wrestling than of Shakespeare.

They should have cut out most of the dialogue and focused on the action, for a tighter, more exciting, package.

20 July 2000,Best movie I¬¥ve seen this year so far...,"After watching the unbearable Mission: Impossible 2 two days ago (only for die-hard Cruise fans), I was a bit reluctant to watch a nearly 3 hours long movie about ancient Rome this afternoon, but I¬¥m glad I did!

This movie is great because you really get to feel sympathy for the main character, as the events take place and he ends up where he ends up (forgive my English, I¬¥m sure there is a better way to type that last phrase.)

Also the scenarios are greatly computer-generated, but that is not the main attraction of the film, and that¬¥s good because many films these days rely on the computers to save the day. The movie is long, but it never gets boring, and the action scenes are really well done. The story is similar to those of the classics such as Ben-Hur or Quo Vadis but hey, everybody expected that.

Anyway enough talk, go and watch it because it¬¥s destined to become a classic, if it¬¥s not already.

6 May 2000,"S P A R T A C U S T W O...veni,vidi,vici...","At last a gladiator movie for the fans of that genre and no B-grade one at that...and not an italian film director in sight. Sorry just a Fellini dig there, just couldnt resist. I looked hard for any evidence of another ""Caligula"" remake but this is a far superior depiction of ancient Rome and none of that unnecessary debauchery either.A muscular Russell Crowe has fun here with a lot of chain-mail(roman internet) tridents, spears, swords the lot. Looking more macho here than he did in ""LA Confidential"". He plays a good guy called Maximus. A general turned slave turned gladiator and he's out for revenge against...Joaquin Phoenix. Looking all grown up,pumped up and beefed up with god knows what, last seen in ""8MM"". Joaquin plays a guy with the unlikely name of Commodus(I just kept thinking of a toilet seat) who is just as nasty as nasty can be. Definitely the villain of the year. With all the expected hype this is definitely no sleeper movie. Its just too good to keep quiet for so long. Even if you dont get into the plot which is understandable enough just go for the fighting and the blood and the guts and the gore of which there is a moderate amount. Historically inaccurate though it may be and no doubt purists will howl at this it is extremely watchable not only for the drama in the great circus but the political shenanigans behind the scenes which tells you that nothing much has changed really in that quarter. We are all bored with sci-fi at the moment considering the extrememly disappointing ""Phantom Menace"" not to mention the doomed from the start ""Mission to Mars"". Drown you sorrows in this movie and you'll feel so much better afterwards. Salve. Pax Britannica....",
10 October 2000,Warrior Glory,"Ridley Scott scores a palpable hit with 'Gladiator'. I've seen it twice now, and know that I will revisit this tale of heroism and integrity for the rest of my life. Musically powerful; photographically virtuosic, 'Gladiator' is a tale told of a man, by a man. Russell Crowe is astounding as Maximus. Richard Harris carries the weight of a waning empire in his eyes. Joaqin Phoenix seethes a rage of Shakespearean, Lear-like proportions. Oliver Reed knows Life, so near to death is he. I'm blessed by this film. Thanks to all of you who performed with Strength and Honor to create it for us.

6 May 2000,"""FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE, SALUTE YOU""","yes! This movie lives up to it`s name!! You almost feel like your a Roman spectator at the coliseum watching the games!! The costumes and scenery seem very realistic to that time in history. And the battle scene at the beginning of the movie is one of the best battle scenes i`ve ever seen, in fact it might be better than the battle scenes in braveheart, it`s very very close!! the acting is good, and this movie should win atleast one award. The only thing that might keep this movie from winning best picture is all the gore. So if you have a weak stomach don`t watch this movie, but if your into this type of action i highly recommend it. rating (best of 5 stars).....4.....

21 April 2007,Gloomy epic,"Let me start by stating that this is not one of the best epic - Roman era movies ever. Not even close! As any historical movie fan, I was immensely impressed by the fight scenes. The movie should be credited with its success in the battle and hand to hand fight parts. It can be even said that Gladiator has the best ever ""arena - fight"" episodes. Sadly, this is all there is to this film. The entire movie is dull and apart from action parts you keep yawning and looking at your watch wondering when the next action scene starts. Weak dialogs and gloomy air is the reason for the downfall of Gladiator. I still recommend it if the cinema hall you go allows you to go to canteen and have some coke between action scenes.

4 July 2002,Overrated movie about fight techniques (minor spoilers),"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6
7 May 2000,Cliched epic,"I liked the comment of one reviewer, who said that scenes of Elysium were like ""a luxury car commercial"". So true, I kept expecting a disembodied voice to say, 'try the new Chariot Romanus, id est optimus!'

Someone poured millions into this and hired a competent director, a competent, sullen actor and competent script writer, and they all made a movie which I reluctantly went to see and now wish I hadn't wasted two hours of my priceless 3 score and 10. I learn slowly, but I'm learning....

2 July 2000,"I am writing this, because I cannot leave the line blank. Read the comment.","In the Academy Awards show, the host, Billy Crystal, claimed to be able to read people's mind and thoughts, and when Russell Crowe's face was shown in the big TV screen, Billy said something like ""..I could use a cigarette."", and those who got to see Crowe's face might have noticed that he had the same facial expression as in all his films, a serious face. I personally believe that is something to admire, being so serious all the time. We don't see Russell smiling or laughing a lot, but that doesn't affect his acting skills at all.

Crowe did an excellent job as Maximus in this movie, Gladiator. The rest of the cast was very good, including Joaquin Phoenix, who surprised me with his great performance.

The plot is pretty good, I wouldn't say it's VERY entertaining, it has some very few dialogues that could be considered boring, but overall, it's a great script.

The recreation of the ancient Rome is just excellent. The architecture of the buildings and The Coliseum is just fantastic. People in charge of that deserve a lot of credit and recognition.

The movie could be considered long (over 150 minutes), and some people might find a few scenes boring, but generally the movie keeps the viewers paying attention all the time. The fight scenes were very good, people who aren't big action fans might enjoy watching this film (though it's not completely action, a little drama too).

Crowe's character in here is very interesting. It's the kind of person that expresses the kind of feelings that make you think he doesn't fear anything, he always knows what to do next and he thinks the right way. While watching the film you get to like the character.

The ending is tragic but at the same time happy. The ""bad guy"" dies and the ""good guy"" wins, but something that maybe people weren't expecting, the good guy dies too. Maximus takes revenge, killing the Caesar, and then he dies, but if you think carefully, you'll notice that he actually wanted to die, to be together with his wife and son again, in the life after death.

This was a good movie. It's not the kind of movie that really ""gets into you"" and causes strange feelings and such (not many movies do that), but it's a good film and certainly worth watching. I'll rate it with a 9 out of 10.",9
20 September 2000,Immersive!,"First off let me say that the best way to enjoy this movie is on a big screen, with loud sound. Seeing this movie in the West Edmonton Mall's Silver City theater was perhaps one of the greatest and most involving cinema experiences I have ever had. The deafening roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, and the incredible visuals on a huge screen drew me into the movie like no other film has.

Pretty much everything about this movie is amazing from start to finish. My only warning is that some scenes may be a little to brutal or graphic for some people (I know even I cringed a couple of times) and you might be a little careful who you watch this with.

Ahh, who cares! The experience'll probably do them good. 9/10 on My Personal Scale.

23 July 2000,"Been there, done that.....better.","I'm sure to be one of the few that didn't like this picture.

The opening scene was fine, as were the cast and sfx (mostly). However the story was a pastiche of genre films, such as Spartacus, that did it better. The Arena scenes, surely the draw for most viewers, were few, brief and done with close ups and quick cut editing that obscured most of the action. Anthony Quinn and Victor Mature did it better....in Black & White no less.

17 May 2000,Greatest Sorta True Story Ever Told; Most GLORIOUS!,"Gladiator, is the greatest story ever told. The greatest and most glorious film ever created without a doubt. If you have no appreciation for history, your ancestors, or the course of mankind, your family or yourself, you might not like this film.

Gladiator should serve notice to mankind, of what in fact, mankind is not. No honor, no glory, no wisdom as well as many other faults. Today, commercials, radio, cash and campaign managers determine our leaders. Not for accomplishments or ability but for status and figure head. Gladiator, depicts Rome, and a few leaders in a time of great corruption and mis-guidance of central authority.

Gladiator illustrates the price of Roman restoration, and what it will cost the United States, to restore our leadership in all branchs of government, except possibly the Judicial Branch. Our leaders are immoral, corrupt, and ride on the backs of others. No mater the party affiliation, sex and money(Democrats), or Iran-Contra/Coke/or the ruininous state of Texas(Republicans), all are corrupt, and frankly only SANDBAG the government our people need. Anyone see stats/statistic on Texas, it is the most toxic state in the country! Thank you Gov. Bush. Florida beachs don't smell to good this year either, more like sewage.

Gladiator inspires the mind, even after viewing 4 times, it is still compelling both emotional and morally. If only our leaders would have even 1% of Maximus's morality, loyalty and compassion, we would be a better world, 100 times over....",10

6 September 2022,The Cinematography,"Say what you will about the acting, historical inaccuracy, action scenes, Russell Crowe, etc... One thing that stands the test of time and makes modern films look like a joke is the cinematography in this movie. It is decades ahead of everything else that came out during that time, and still ahead of all the poorly produced big budget series and films that come out nowadays. It could be mostly because everything nowadays is filmed with digital cameras and the lighting is off as a result. This came out at a rare time in human history when movies weren't made to be vessels for whatever political ideology the writers/director wanted to push on their audience. Instead there are powerful characters of all genders and races that appear naturally in the film, and there is an incredible amount of effort in the quality of dialogue + soundtrack that beautifully intertwines. This is without a doubt one of the best films of the 21st century, still to this day unmatched by an excess of overpaid directors and writers who would've never made it past their pitch meetings 20 years ago.

I have heard rumors Hollywood is attempting to reboot Gladiator, or make a sequel. You can expect that to be a mockery of this film on every possible artistic level. Parting words of advice, do not try to capture lightning in a bottle twice.",10
7 February 2002,One big 'meh'...,"Ay, carumba... I was looking forward to this film, as I generally like these types of films, and I was thinking it would contain some epic qualities of action, intrigue, characterization, etc. However, this was one big 'meh', and I ended up regretting the time it took to watch over a few days during my lunch hour!

The picture just wasn't very exciting or interesting. There was nothing in it that I didn't expect to happen as I watched it. The characters were predictably bland. Even the fight scenes were rather ho-hum. Just a lot of bashing and blood, which is probably what it really was like, but you know, in a film, you expect some more kind of essence or drama to it. The final fight between Maximus and Commodus? Who cared, by that point? There was very little artistry or drama to something that should have been quite a powerful confrontation... I agree with Roger Ebert's review that the look of it was very dark and bland and depressing, both visually and in terms of character.

What's really baffling is how this was awarded best picture of the year, and Crowe as best actor, and that what's his name playing Commodus was even nominated for an Oscar! Yikes. I mean, I suppose it may have been a weak year, and you certainly can't count on the Best Picture being the 'best picture', but you expect it to at least have something significant to it. This had very, very little to it. I think of just two years ago, when the Best Pic noms were - Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and Thin Red Line. Every one of those movies had so much more to them than this film does. It's almost ridiculous, the difference there. Not to mention others that weren't even nominated that year, like Truman Show and Gods and Monsters...

Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (that's his name!) were both rather unspectacular, mumbling their way through their lines like David Mamet's mock GREAT ACTOR would. (It's no wonder they were rewarded so!) They just didn't really cement themselves into those roles, particularly Phoenix. I can think of several others who could have done that part, and might have been more interesting. Then again, it could have been the direction, or the script, but his character actually seemed to have some of the more interesting things to say, so that probably rules that out. And it's not so much that Crowe was bad in the part, but it just wasn't that much of a part. He fights, he looks veangeful and sad, he mumbles a few lines, he fights some more, he longs for his family, fights some more... Not all that much to dig into, really. I haven't seen The Insider or A Beautiful Mind yet, but I must imagine that there's a lot more for him to have been 'best actor' for in those characters and films.

There were some little things here and there that were alright, and some of the minor characters did well, but on the whole, a pretty big waste of time to watch...

-EE-",6
3 November 2001,uh good?,"Not hardly. If you want to see a predictable, extremely gory, and a bunch of mumbling actors in a completely over-rated film, Gladiator is the movie for you. That's truly what this movie is. Maybe the movie would have been better if you could have actually heard the dialogue, but i doubt it.

19 September 2002,Scott or Crowe...who had the better performance?,"In the long line of ancient Rome movies, no one has been able to master the true beauty of the ancient empire than Ridley Scott has with this masterpiece. With the help of Franzoni's ear for dialogue, Scott brings forth arguably his best movie to date. With Russell Crowe landing the lead in any movie, it makes the job of the director that much easier. Crowe puts forth a magnificent Oscar worthy performance that will be remembered in Hollywood for a very long time!

9 August 2002,Russell Crowe's moment,"Russell Crowe won an Academy Award for his performance in the ""Best Picture"" of 2000, ""Gladiator,"" a highly enjoyable but also overrated movie. When I first saw this in theaters, I thought of it as a decent popcorn flick, not one without depth, but a popcorn flick nonetheless. I was surprised to see this movie winning the Best Picture Academy Award. Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy this movie but it seems to have earned more in accolades than it actually deserved. Just my opinion. Look for Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad"") as fellow gladiator, Juba.

18 August 2000,Lacks originality,"After seeing this film my generally neutral attitude to Fall of Roman Empire (the film the Gladiator is almost a remake of-at least the same period and the same characters, almost the same beginning and the end) to almost an admiration. Almost forty years ago they made a watchable, highly spectacular film, with no pretention to be more than a big costume drama, with a wonderful star cast and the magnificent Sophia Loren in the midst of it. What about the gladiator? special effects used to restore the ancient rome are very good. And film is a good sample of new technical solutions for historical films. But apart from this The Gladiator has nothing to be proud of. I can say that there are at least 2 reasons for a film-addicted person like me to dislike it:

1. The story. This is not even a drama, this is melodrama, plot lines concerning children and Christianity are very weak and can be used as a samples (in comparison with the above mentioned nice film of sixties) of incrreasing religiousness and family values addiction of Americans (the trends that may be are not bad as just a social-cultural phenomena but have a very bad impact on cinema). The development of the story is very flat and predictable, (europeans,especially french, often make some new interpretation of old movie themes, but always add something new and original not just to filmmaking process but to the story as well. The story of Gladiator is to polished,well known, reserved, making impression that its makers were doing everything to avoid any originality and interesting moves. 2. The cast. Well, its nod bad, but the main character looks more rather like rugby player than roman general, though his acting is rather good(though not an Oscar-worthy), Mr. Phoenix visually is rather a good type for the Emperor, but all the rest are very boring and unappealing, including the main fimale character (good looks, good acting, but.. not Sophia Loren), It was especially disappointing to see a very bleak and unimaginative acting of great actors of the elder generation (Richard Harris and late Oliver Reed).

Finally I must say that the director of this film, Mr Riddley Scott who made several very good films in his early career started loosing imagination in 90-ies. All his last films have a very promising plot, but a rather ordinary solution. Unfortunately The Gladiator is not an exception.",3

6 May 2000,Braveheart meets the 13th warrior!,"If you've seen Braveheart, then chances are you'll think this film is eerily similar. I wouldn't rate Gladiator up there with Braveheart, that's why I say it's a mix. The 13th warrior had plenty of action, but it lacked a central theme and a strong character. Gladiator has these faults to a lesser degree, and it has the same muddy look to it. It is a good film...just not a great one. So, if you liked the 13th warrior then you'll like this film, but if you think 13th warrior was a little shallow and convoluted, then chances are you'll come out of this movie with similar thoughts.

20 April 2000,Summer Blockbuster,"I must say that I thought this film was excellent. It had a good story line, good cast (Russel Crowe was superb!!), and excellent special effects, although part of the opening battle scene was filmed in a way which was hard to follow. I saw the film at a media screening and this version contained quite a few scenes of people being decapitated and was also two and a half hours long so it might be edited further, (not too much I hope).

The fight scene where tigers are involved was superb and Ridley Scott was at his best. A must see which is up there with Spartacus and Ben Hur.

28 April 2001,Great movie? Yes! Best picture? Hmmmm...,"I saw Gladiator last May and really enjoyed it. I have never seen a movie of this scope and dealing with this subject, so I thought that it was original for today's types of movies. I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and thought that he did a great job in the title role of Maximus. He is a very strong character who follows his own path and ideas, but shows a tender side in his desire to be with his family. The majority of the cast was great, especially Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He has a very strong talent and will be sure to make an impact in movies in the future. However, I thought that Connie Neilsen's Lucilla was a bit weak and while she did display some independence in her actions and thoughts, she still held true to the standards of typical women's roles. While I did think that the movie was great, it was hardly the best picture of 2000... but I'm not sure what would be instead. It was a fairly weak year for the movies in comparison with recent years, especially 1999. It was nice to see Russell Crowe win the Oscar for best actor, but he should have received it LAST year for his stirring portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand instead of Maximus. His performance in Gladiator was excellent, but somehow it did not measure up to his former role. I still believe that Tom Hanks was robbed for not getting an Oscar instead!

26 March 2001,you people are never satisfied!!!!,"I was reading the comments, and some things become apparent. When Russell Crowe does show his outrageous upper body, people whine about him being some kind of male pig. But when he doesn't, you whine! Same thing with the realistic traits. When there are historical inaccuracies, FOR SHAME!!!! Well, make some note of these points:

1. MOVIES ARE NOT DOCUMENTARIES. When will people learn that entertainment is seldom reality and reality seldom entertaining. For example, there's the part where thumbs up meant death and closed thumbs meant life. In reality, that would be the case. However, put that in a movie and it would just serve to confuse modern day audiences. ""Should Maximus live or die?!?!?! ohhhhhh ohhhhhhhh Commidus chooses...was that sign language he just used???"" Number two example: Maximus goes riding into battle with German Sheperds instead of Mastiffs(which was the real dogs they would have used). If you would have put Mastiffs into the picture, it would have been like lending Auggie Dog to a noble moment. A Mastiff is a big droopy mutt. German shepards added to the scene better than the other. So not all realistic things would have worked in an artistic sense. They would have only confused, bored the audience, or conflicted with themes.

2. IT WAS A RITUAL FORMULA, WHICH WOMEN JUST EAT UP!!! Lets face it, he's fighting for love, and for his country. So unselfish. Women just swoon for those kind of heroes. Remember Braveheart? Same thing, and also historically inaccurate. But both films were successful. Gladiator takes a traditional theme and makes it fly high. I was impressed.

3. Roger Ebert just doesn't understand- He whines that alot of the setting was dark. Well it was! Duh! Where's the electricity in this scene Roger?!?! This story is second century A.D. Of course it was dark. He also complains about Gladiator being muddy. Well, let me explain why the movie was so muddy. Mud goes great with gladiators. Mud goes great with blood. There was a lot of that in the film, right Roger? As dark as it may seem, it is a film with dualistic properties. It focuses on death as a latent theme, but what shines through is more about life and living. That everyone will die someday, but it is best to live to the fullest until that time comes.",

Russell Crowe is a (cardboard) fool, all his posing and serious looks can never save this multi-million-million-multi-multi-million dollar piece of crap ego-fodder. You're all fools, you and Ridley Scock!

11 May 2014,Legendary Doesn't Even Describe This Movie! I am entertained!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
16 May 2000,A great cast!,"To be honest, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would (I assumed it would be the usual Ridley Scott 'action-packed' fare--no offense intended towards Mr. Scott). Even though there are a few minor historical inconsistencies, what makes it fun to watch are the great cast members (Sir Richard Harris, Sir Derek Jacobi, Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, etal) and the interesting camera shots.

All in all, a good movie--one for which I gladly paid full price.

1 May 2001,No big deal.,"This is a good movie for watching on TV if there are no Star Trek reruns on. Heck, I've even seen some infomercials that were more entertaining than this. It sure wasn't ""Best Picture"" material.

24 May 2000,"Terrific entertainment, not an historical document","I fully enjoyed this movie...It is in the same league as The mask of Zorro (1998). It recalls the times when they made movies for the masses. But great ones. Excellent movie, not an historical portrait. Not a serious movie. Plain entertainment. So well done, I felt a kid at the movies again. Crowe is absolutely magnificent. As is Phoenix as the whining emperor.

And shut up about oscars. It doesn't deserve any oscar. Crowe doesn't either. Please...it is an adventure movie with no pretentions what so ever.

If you feel down, need an uplift, a moral push? Are you dissapointed by most modern action yarns...? See this movie.

11 May 2000,Hollywood finally tells a good story again!,"Gladiator is really a sweeping epic of a film! It is truly something else. I've been waiting for this type of film to be made again. It's a lot like the great big films of the late fifties. There's no sex, no foul language, and no nudity - instead they tell a gritty, fantastically engrossing story that kept me white knuckled throughout most of it.

The acting is superb and the casting is dynamite. I really despised Phoenix's character - just what I was supposed to feel. I had never thought much of this younger brother to River Phoenix, but now I see that he really can deliver. And Crowe, well, let's just say I've been waiting for the U.S. to realize what a great actor this man is.

Gladiator and U-571 are two of the finest films Hollywood has cranked out in decades. They've really told stories and stories that don't need the ""F"" word peppered throughout it (tell me where the difficulty there is for screenwriters to come up with that word?) I'm very liberal and not much bothers me, but I'm sick to death of cursing in movies when it doesn't add to the film and it just seems to be in there for shock value.

So, now I can really say, ""Hurray for Hollywood!""",
7 May 2000,"Rousing entertainment with subtexts you can engage with, or not. .as you please","Gladiator is one of those rare films that does not depend on one single knock-em-dead effect or device. It's like a great meal you really enjoy without noticing one individual ingredient. Hence it's rather difficult to take it apart.

Firstly it's great entertainment. This is a film designed to entertain, something many studios and directors have forgotten how to do in search of the Great Message that will change the World. You could almost call it a 'people's film' just as Maximus becomes the people's hero.

The analogies in the film to modern life can be taken as far as you like without spoiling your enjoyment of the story and the spectacle you engage in. Entrepreneurs, the Olympics, sport-as-war, war-as-entertainment, public image creation, it's all there if you want to philosophise about modern spectacle.

But Gladiator is still a good story about a deprived hero setting out to Get Even with the usurper who knocked him down. It sounds hackneyed but Ridley Scott knows how to get your emotions really inside the story so you care about the characters.

It's really Russell Crowe's movie. He's so dominant and so bloody good. However he doesn't steal the film from other characters, which is another measure of a great actor. Joaquin Phoenix gives a very insightful interpretation of a man who just doesn't get it, who can't work out the secret of how to win love and how to be powerful where it matters most. He's not a stereotypical villain, but this does not detract from the film's impact, rather it enhances it.

The supporting cast are just as good and it's an eclectic blend of accents and styles but it works. Actually I found it refreshing to hear Australian, English, American and European all together - it made the film more universal.

The pacing of Gladiator is excellent. Despite the early fight scene I found my involvement built up slowly until I was hooked about half an hour in. The Germania battle I found distracting, only because I hate dropped frames and I don't think Scott does this as well as Spielberg did in Private Ryan. It's well-intentioned but I found it irritating.

Violence was controlled and in context and worked very well. This is after all a battle epic. The choice of film stock sometimes came to the fore a bit more than I liked - I felt it was overdone.

But on an emotional level this film worked beautifully for me. Like the Colosseum audience, I cheered for Maximus and booed for Commodus. It was fun. The ending was appropriate given all that Maximus had lost. I didn't feel cheated or deprived. I felt I saw what I came to see and got a bonus.

The subtexts you can take or leave as you wish. Gladiator doesn't force them down your neck. But if you want to engage at a philosophical as well as a visceral level, then you can. A rare achievement. Ole Scott, Ole Crowe. Ole Gladiator.",8
8 May 2000,One of the most Realistic Depictions Ever of Tyranny and Heroism,"First let me say this. Russell Crowe kicked serious butt in this film. From his excellent Sword-work to his well-tuned voice, he more than accuratly portrayed a man tormented by the loss of his Emperor, the loss of his family, and the loss of his freedom, both to Slavery and a Tyrannical Dictator.

The film looked very authentic, ranging from the gruesome but realistic battles and Gladiator matches to showing what Ancient Rome might have looked like at the height of it's power and glory.

If I sat on the Academy, I would have to definately give this film a lot of nominations for Best Picture, Director, and Actor. I loved the script and that should be given a lot of credit if not a Nomination.

My hat goes off to director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. Well Done.",10
2 January 2001,Not as good as SPARTACUS or BEN HUR.,"I was disappointed by this film. At times I thought I was watching one of those Italian Hercules Steve Reeves films from 60's (the ones that say FINE at the end, but they really weren't that good ;). At other times I thought I was watching BRAVEHEART MEETS THE PATRIOT MEETS SPARTACUS. I was never really drawn in to the Russell Crowe character, in fact, I felt more sympathy for Comodius than Maximus.

While the slashing and chopping is entertaining in a sort of WCW way, it seemed contrived and obligatory. As a history lesson it ranks right next to MONTY PYTHON'S SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL.

If I had a choice between films along similar lines like SPARTACUS, BEN HUR, or GLADIATOR, I would definitely see one of the earlier films and skip GLADIATOR.

5 July 2000,Maybe I'd expected too much but entertained,"Since I'd heard the new Roman gladiator movie has been made, I'd gotten excited and had high expectation. I'm not trying to say I didn't like this movie. I loved this movie and want to see it again. I think that I'd expect a movie, a masterpiece like ben-hur. This movie should have been a masterpiece with these marvelous actors, big budget, talented director.

When I first saw ""Gladiator"", the one thing I didn't like was ending. in ending scene the whole theater starts laughs. too cheesy to touch. How could Lucilla and the people let Roman Emperor's dead body abandoned like that? I think there's lack details of how brutal, devilish the emperor was. and how much the people in Rome hated their emperor.

Joaquin Phoenix was the most outstanding part to me. Russell crowe was a gorgeous and excellent figure as always. I hope there would be lots of Oscar chance to come!!

22 May 2000,1 dimensional characters and poor filming of the fights,"This movie really disappointed me. The characters were one dimensional. The battles in the arena were confusing. Things happened so fast and the shots were usually so close up, that I couldn't make out what was going on. I think some slow motion could have made it more effective.

4 May 2011,Are you not entertained?,"If you're not, then watch this film. After quite a long time, I have seen a film which is near-perfect. Outstanding story, outstanding acting, direction, music, production design, cinematography, editing and what not.

The film is a fictionalized account of life of a Roman General Maximus, whose family is murdered (crucified), he himself is ordered to be hanged, all thanks to evil emperor Commodus. However, the destiny had other plans, he is turned into slave, into gladiator and ultimately he is fated to avenge his family.

Probably Ridley Scott's best film, his magnificent vision of ancient Rome and focused direction is something to be applauded. His way of story telling has unique style to it. He got almost all things right - ranging from costumes to acting, sets to cinematography.

While film's story sounds like some classical Shakespeare tragedy, David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson manage to give the script a cinematic edge. Although the film suffers some schmaltzy dialogs here and there, but it is engaging enough to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.

The film's sheer USP is the lead actors - Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Viewers feel the vengeance and sorrow of Maximus. Crowe's portrayal of Maximus is very humanly. Crowe manages to show the most complicated complex emotions in a very effortless way. But for me, Joaquin Phoenix took the cake away for his Commodus - he is as evil as a Satan but the same time, we all feel for him. Sometimes he behaves as if he is a sociopath, but again, he behaves as if he is not loved. Phoenix's pure acting talent will leave you spellbound.

Apart from above, the film features amazing score by Hans Zimmer. The tracks ""Wheat"" and ""Progeny"" are completely haunting and they echo to your ears even after the film is over. The film features beautiful photography by John Mathieson, which is, of course, is highly color graded, but still, gorgeous none-the-less. Production Design by Arthur Max is breath-taking - you are really immersed into the 180 AD Rome.

Another thing worth mentioning is the visual effects used in the film - the complete re-creation of the time-period, the digital reconstruction of Colosseum and of course the CGI tigers - are all outstanding, and it is very well justified why the film won Oscar for Visual Effects.

In the end, Gladiator is highly entertaining, and at times, tear jerking film which is extremely well-made, fueled with great acting of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Do not miss it.

8.5/10 (rounded off to 9)",9
6 March 2022,Beautiful,"This is yet another great historical fictional drama that will go down in the ages as one of the best. The musical score stays with me to this day. Hans Zimmer is a musical genius!

25 August 2000,Definitely worth watching!,"Gladiator is a movie which is definitely worth watching! It has stunning action sequences (such as the initial battle scene), incredible visual effects, and a gripping, interesting story. Crowe does an excellent job, but Phoenix, as Commodus, is the one who probably deserves the biggest applause. And the computer-generated reconstruction of the city of Rome at the peak of the Roman Empire's grandeur is simply breathtaking!

I would say this is one of the best movies ever... if it wasn't for the ending. The little speech that Lucilla gives after the final fight between Commodus and Maximus was the downpoint of the movie - it is so typical of big Hollywood studios to insert a final ""message"" by a character as a learning point of the movie. This movie does not need any messages or learning points: they are very evident. The final speech takes away all of the excitement from the recently-finished fight, and all grandeur from Crowe's character, since Lucilla steals the end. It was disappointing, and reminded me it's just another Hollywood movie, even though the rest is very good.",9

23 November 2000,All I can say is.... WOW!,"I had wanted to see this movie since it came out, but due to a hectic schedule, I was never able to. I got it the day it came out on dvd, and tried to watch it that night, only to fall asleep within the first 3 minutes. I didnt even get past the credits. So, when I got home from work the next night, I plopped down on the sofa and spent the next few hours glued to the telly. This movie is AMAZING!!!!!! I watched it, then watched all the special features on the second disc, and ended not getting to bed until about 2 in the morning. Russell Crowe may have been noticed by Hollywood in L.A. Confidential, but this is the movie that made him a STAR. He is amazing, going from strong and forceful Roman General, to showing remorse for his wife and child, accepting his fate as a slave, then realizing that he has a chance to go to Rome and perhaps extract his revenge on the evil Commodus. This is not just a guy movie, as there is alot of emotion in it. Love, loss, happiness, and more... This is now my favorite movie of all time. If you havent seen it, RENT IT AND WATCH IT. If you dont feel the same way I do, well, then... Watch it again!

27 May 2000,"Awesome Crowd Pleaser, for me though...","This will make a lot of money. I'm telling that right now, it'll make a hell of a lot of money, and Dreamworks keeps hitting the jackpot with last year's success with American Beauty and this year, GLADIATOR.

Even though this will make LOTS of dough, I on the other hand was disappointed. There were all the ingredients to make a Best Picture film, but it didn't quite come close, in my opinion.

The film had Ridley Scott, first of all, one of the most influential film-makers of all time with films such as Blade Runner, Alien, or Thelma and Louise. Hans Zimmer was behind the music, who I consider to be THE GOD of film music. Then there were the actors who I thought all of them including Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Dijimon Honsou, Derek Jacobi, and many others, pulled off a wonderful job. Now, the problem was with the pace of the film. There were great action sequences, great dramatic cinematography, great sound, but the pace of transitions and each scenes to be the problem.

The pace of the film seemed to give almost a blockbuster-typish pace of fast-paced, moving camera with the music overtone between scenes which in many respects threw the film off. What's great about epics made by filmmakers such as David Lean or Francis Ford Coppola is that they have moments for the audience to take in what they have just seen and sometimes just enjoy a moment of silence, almost, by just staring into a great landscape or a character who was in despair or deep in thought or etc. The pace that was almost like Michael-Bay-type threw of the film for me, personally. Each sequences were so well done, that I don't think any of the audiences might have gotten bored by five or seven seconds of silence between some of the scenes. This was a very DIFFERENT film than the other Ridley Scotts in terms of the story telling and the work of the cameras in many of the scenes.

One problem I had with some of the visuals, which is usually hard to find in Ridley Scott films but there was anyway, was that many of the angles of the collusseum or the city of Rome or inside the CAESAR's palace, was that they seemed to close down the view. There seemed to be too many BIG master shots and then just CLOSE-UPS that there wasn't really any shots for the audience to look around at the people or the normal structures or objects that might have given the audience more of an open feeling, rather than just watching something that someone else shot for them to see.

Also, there was an awkward problem with the screenplay because of some of the dialogues, but mainly because of the ending. I will not include it in here since you might have not seen the film yet, but you might feel awkward as I did in the end.

Other than those, it was a GREAT crowd pleaser. Also, great images as usual like any other Ridley Scotts but somehow, very different. But anyway, I in someways liked the film, but I was disappointed to see a film that could have been SO MUCH better. ** 1/2 out of **** or a B/B+ rating.",
11 July 2000,A very enjoyable and well produced film,"I always enjoy films about the Roman period and this one did not disappoint me. The opening battle scence was spectacular. I thought that Russel Crowe was slightly miscast in the part of main character Maximus, although his acting was good. The computer graphics were well done the scenes of ancient Rome were impressive but some of the animation was too repetiive and became unbeleivable. I rate this film along with other greats like Spartacus and Braveheart. Lets have many more

9 May 2000,Good Film but Very Derivative of Braveheart,"Think a minute & tell me what film I'm describing: It's an historical drama which is only loosely based on history. Its hero is a strong-willed man who only wants to live his own life but whose wife is killed by an evil ruler & who vows revenge. In later portions of the film, he dreams of being together with his wife in an idyllic setting. He has a loyal Irish sidekick & the film features airy music & large & violent battle scenes. The hero of the film is fighting for freedom and against tyranny & in the end, although he dies, he succeeds in bringing freedom to his people. Sound like any movie you know? Maybe...Braveheart? Well, all those features also apply to the new film Gladiator, a shallow but entertaining Braveheart rip-off set in the Roman Empire c. 180 A.D.

Maximus is a popular general of the Roman legions for whom the Emperor Marcus Aurelius has just bypassed his son, the incompetent Commodus, as his successor. Marcus wants Maximus to bring power to the Roman senate & bring freedom to the Roman people who have been living under the yoke of the Emperors. Unfortunately, when Commodus learns of Marcus' plan, he kills the old man, kills Maximus' family, & tries to kill Maximus himself. But Maximus escapes & winds up a slave in North Africa where he is trained as a gladiator.

Eventually, the gladiators are brought to perform in Rome where Commodus has ordered a lengthy series of games to improve his popularity. Various schemes ensue until there is a big showdown in the gladiatorial ring between Commodus & Maximus.

The film at least has the honesty to admit (in a blurb at the end) that, while it contains historical characters, the story it tells is fictional. It is an entertaining movie but it's not as good as it could have been. The opening battle scene, while suitably noisy & crowded, is not up to any of the battles in Braveheart (the Romans' German opponents look like a bunch of poorly armed old men--the sort of soldiers who, centuries later, would have been guarding the Fuhrerbunker in 1945 & not a formidable opponent for the Roman legions). The gladiator scenes are mostly good, although like most of the film they lack the feel of authentic history. However, while the action is pretty good, the whole bit about Maximus' desire for revenge & his goal of freeing the senate is uninvolving & the plotting between Commodus' sister Drusilla, the senators, Commodus, & various others seems to be there mostly to fill screen time between gladiator matches.

There are a few good bits in the film. In particular, the scenes of the gladiators seeing & then entering the Colosseum for the first time are impressive & the battle scenes of the legions have their moments. But the numerous & often weird & gratuitous `borrowings' from Braveheart (both films even have the hero voice an aphorism about death-`Every man dies, not every man really lives'-Braveheart vs. `Death smiles at all men, but some of them smile back'-Gladiator) leave a bad taste in one's mouth & make one wish that the `creative' forces behind Dreamworks had used a little bit more of their *own* creativity on this film & not relied so extensively on the creativity of others. I'd give it two stars out of four, but add a star if you didn't see Braveheart.",
6 May 2000,"Some scenes do breach the pale and reach moments of genius, but they are few and far between...","This was a fascinating film which far exceeded my expectations. The movie was being pitched as the latest and greatest Roman Empire film of all time, a modern return to the days of Cecil B. DeMille and the old epic films. The scale of the film is impressive, and some scenes do breach the pale and reach moments of genius, but unfortunately they are few and far between, and for the most part the film plays like just another period action flick. However, though it doesn't reach the heart and spirit of BRAVEHEART, the film achieves moments of greatness and admiration which defy overtly sentimental nostalgia. In the end, the film is about a man who defies great odds in his quest for justice and peace. It is the story of a man of honor and integrity who must overcome tyranny, deception, injustice, brutality and even his own insatiable hunger for revenge. It succeeds on this level.

Russell Crowe (THE INSIDER, LA CONFIDENTIAL, VIRTUOUSITY) does well as General Maximus who is cast into slavery and who must fight and kill to survive as a gladiator in late second century Rome. Add into the mix a dabble of cliche' political intrigue (an unworthy Roman despot Caesar Commodus -- played to a tee by Joaquin Phoenix (8MM, CLAY PIGEONS, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS) -- kills his ailing father who just happens to be Caesar Marcus Aurelius (played by the venerable Richard Harris (UNFORGIVEN, A MAN CALLED HORSE, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY) in order to succeed to the throne. Like Shakespeare's HAMLET, this act of familial homicide fuels the plot and drives the characters to their eventual destinies in the Coliseum.

Other players of worthy mention: the lovely Connie Nelson (MISSION TO MARS, PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, DEVIL'S ADVOCATE), who plays Lucilla, daughter of Aurelius, sister and near love slave to Commodus, his successor; and Oliver Reed (THE BRUCE, THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TOMMY and a bunch of great Poe adaptions and Hammer films). Unfortunately, Reed died during production, but his performance on screen as gladiator turned gladiator-owner Proximo is superb and one his best! Easily.

The music for the film surpasses a great many period-piece scores which border on the pretentious and uninspired. This score for Gladiator is at once moving, powerful, emotive and most importantly interesting. It doesn't attract attention to itself, yet it manages to support the story quite nicely. Composed by Hans Simmer (CRIMSON TIDE and THE ROCK) with assistance by ethereal vocalist Lisa Gerrard, much of the music approaches the greatness of those soundtracks which stand on their own as great pieces of music vis-a-vis Peter Gabriel's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.

My biggest criticism of the film has to do with Ridley Scott and the cinematography. Most of the action scenes, especially the battle scenes are all close-ups and tight shots. This lends to visual confusion, blurriness and a general lack of clarity. While such an effect might lend itself thematically to the ""heat of the battle,"" it does nothing to aid the viewer who is watching the film and looking for details, clear images and who is trying to pay attention to what is happening. Even the gladiator matches themselves were all tight shots, and though well choreographed, they were at times difficult to follow and even tiring on the eyes. The medium and long range shots of the great epics were absent. The look of pictures by DeMille which helped propel films like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, SAMSON AND DELILAH or Sam Zimbalist's BEN HUR into epic status were left out of Ridley Scott's vision, and for the most part the picture remains on the level of MAD MAX or even Scott's previous ""epic,"" 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE. Interestingly enough, Scott used cinematographer John Mathieson whose previous work includes French films LOVE IS THE DEVIL and VIGO, but nothing to the scale of vision GLADIATOR deserves. Someone like Vilmos Zsigmond (GHOST AND THE DARKNESS) could've really brought a sense of ""bigness"" to the visuals which is lost in GLADIATOR.

In any case, the film is worthy of a solid three stars. It's predictable as hell, but it's great action. The violence is graphic and nasty, but thoroughly essential to the plot and none of it is gratuitous. The players perform at a high level and are believable. Costumes and sets are well made and create a brilliant setting for the film. One other criticism is the use of hokey ""floating"" dream sequences which, like the lackluster cinematography, undermine the grand scale of the picture. With a budget of $100 million and both Dreamworks and Universal Studios behind the picture, the film could have gone without the cheesy Roger Corman / Fred Olan Ray style effects. They really are distracting and detract from the overall effect of the film. (I say this, but other dream sequences are stark and beautiful and provide a sense of awe which the majority of the picture lacks -- unfortunately those scenes don't seem to have to do much with the movie! ;)",
15 May 2000,Ridley is one of my favorite directors only because of the visuals!,"Well Ridley Scott is the director of 2 of my favorite movies of all time, Alien and Blade Runner. I also like Thelma and Louise.

I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a great one. I think that it doesn't beat Thelma and Louise (the film seems to be very underated because everybody said that Gladiator is Scott's best film since Blade Runner or even Alien).

Ridley Scott's good sense of casting is casting is very present in Gladiator and he knows who to direct an actor.

Russell Crowe is very good : I mean he is Maximus ! But I think that the best performance is give by Joaquin Pheonix (maybe it is because his character (Commodus) is the most developed in the film). Pheonix is so incredible that he steal every scenes that he appears !!! Connie Nielsen is impressive has the frightened sister of his younger brother. She is also very beautiful !

The supporting actors are very good too begining with Richard Harris who gives a very credible performance. The late Oliver Reed's first lines are funny and he is also credible. Djumon Hounsou (sorry for the wrong spelling) is good too, but I think that we don't see him too often. Derek Jacobi is always very good. Spencer Treat Clark give a very good young performance as Lucius.

Now technically the film is impressive. The camera works are well done and the cinematography (Ridley's force) is outstanding! Some may not apreciate the effect during the battle scenes. I think that it is a kind of violence censure. The violence is often suggested more than shown. It could have been a lot more gory ! So I think that the fast editing is a good thing, but I was disapointed the first time that I saw the movie (I've seen it twice). The score is very good. Hans Zimmer deserved to be in the Top 10 greatest and prolific Hollywood composers. The score: The Rock meets The Thin Red Line: 8.5/10 . The CGI effects disappointed me in the first viewing, but it grow on me the on the second viewing!

Ridley Scott's direction is NOT at his best but the actors are very well directed and Scott's vision of Rome is well represented. The themes in Gladiator are a bit similar to the themes of Blade Runner, but here stop my comparision with that masterpiece. Surprisingly, there is a ""intimate feel"" in that film and that feels good to have Ridley back! (Unfortunatly his next is going to be bad (""Hannibal"" staring Sir Anthony Hoptkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liota). Ok maybe not, but I have a bad feeling about it! Ridley's cinematography (with the help of cinematographer John Mathiesen) is impressive and he really shows his influences of David Lean. The shots in Morocco remind me a lot of Lawrence of Arabia !

I think that the weakest point of the film is the story. It is not very weak, but it is clich√© and there are a lot of deja vu espacially if you had seen Braveheart two days before ! The characters are not very deep and there are some little plot holes.

Well, I think that it is the Hollywood film that you must see this summer if you only want to watch one, but don't expected a masterpiece it is not. ...A kind of Titanic movie...

8 May 2000,Amazing!,"`What you do in life¬Öit goes an eternity'; Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) says to his legions of men, to rile them up, before they battle a horde of barbarians. The opening sequence in Ridley Scott's new Roman epic has beautiful captivating shot of the destruction from overhead with the flaming arrows flying through the air, great sound, and Crowe to give inspirational speeches to set the whole mood for the next two and a half hours. The $103 million film follows Maximus after he is betrayed by Commodus, portrayed brilliant by Joaquin Phoenix, son of the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who wanted Maximus to take over his empire and restore power to the senate. Well, Commodus would hear none of this so he ridded of Maximus and took care of his evidence of living. After Commodus takes over Maximus begins his quest for vengeance. Oh yeah, the audience is excited because Russell Crowe is Maximus in yet another impressive performance, following 1997's `L. A. Confidential' and his Oscar nominated performance in 1999's `The Insider'. `Gladiator' has all the right components for an amazing epic with some new directorial twists by Scott. The acting is flawless in all aspects, the soundtrack is captivating, the writing is precise, the cinematography is stunning, and the action sequences are uncanny. We've got blood, gore, action, writing, direction, cinematography, special effects, big name actors, a gigantic budget, and historical inaccuracy. We've got the 21-century's spin on a dead genre of film, the Roman epic. All in all, one of the most exciting and satisfying films in recent years and the best one to kick off 2000's summer blockbuster season.

8 May 2000,When in Rome...,"This film reaches some fantastic heights here are my personal highlights:

1. When Maximus(Russell Crowe) reveals himself to Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) after his first victory in the colosseum.

2. The battle in the colosseum: Maximus versus the undefeated gladiator and the lions.

3. The final duel in the colosseum. This was not a long duel, and was represented realistically. An untrained Emperor versus a highly experienced wounded Maximus.

4. ...and any other battle scene in between.

Gladiator looks good, sounds good, and really lifts you, that is you want to be Maximus and avenge the wrongs which have been dealt upon you. A classic good versus evil story.",9
8 May 2000,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!,"I can sum up the experience of Gladiator in one word, AWESOME!!!!! My friend and I went to see it recently and both of us being refined movie critics gave it two big thumbs up, if I could, I'd have voted a 11+ for Gladiator. The action sequences and the visual effects were second to none and there wasn't a point in the movie where I wasn't urning for the next scene to find out what was going to happen! It also leaves us with an important message; It shows us that if an extraordinary man such as Russel Crowe's character (the general) can be humble, kind, unselfish, and save the world (in this case Rome), than there is hope for everyone to do good in their own lives and help the world in some way. Very well done indeed overall and I'd definitely recommend this to any moviegoer looking to wisely spend 2 1/2 hours of his/her time.

7 May 2000,Sword Wielding Fest,"Okay, I enjoyed it in spite of the blood, body count and gore (or maybe because of it). It was well-paced and well-acted. The fight scenes were satisfactory and Russell Crowe looked liked he did know how to hold a sword. This viewer still doesn't know what to think of the ending... seems rather bizarre to me. I guess it was necessary for the two foes to come to a head but I'm not sure that it was entirely convincing to do it in the way it was done. Still I enjoyed the performances of several decent British actors and of course, Russell Crowe is always stunning.

24 November 2012,"If this were a novel, it would be terrible","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
17 July 2000,OLD HOLLYWOOD MEETS NEW HOLLYWOOD,"The great thing about GLADIATOR is the way in which the film combines elements of the classic Hollywood epic with a modern style. It is both respectful of the tradition to which it belongs, and bold enough to step in a new direction. It is not simply a remake of FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (though outwardly the story is virtually the same), but a combination of all the great Roman epics that graced the screen during the fifties and sixties. You have the gladiator school from SPARTACUS, the horrors of the Colosseum from QUO VADIS, the burning conflict between two former allies from BEN HUR, and countless other references to what we have seen before. But, as well as being an example of solid golden Hollywood storytelling the film is stylistically very much of the age. The epic as a genre invariably stretched the scope of film-making, being at the forefront of the latest technical innovations -be they in colour development, sound, format (eg. CinemaScope) or, as with GLADIATOR, computer-generated imagery. But at the heart of any epic is the conflict between (usually) two opposing forces, represented by two characters. And no matter how fine the effects, the art direction and the staging, it is this conflict that must grab our attention. In GLADIATOR, the characters of Commodus and Maximus represent the two opposing forces of insecurity and stability. The dynamics of this conflict, so wonderfully presented by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, are classical in form, though with many ambiguities and cadences that make their conflict far more than a simple battle between good and bad. It is in this aspect that GLADIATOR takes a bold step in using classic Hollywood tradition (goodie versus baddie) to unravel and show the complexities of its characters and their dilemmas. This is a successful strategy because the film holds our interest throughout because of the psychology of the protagonists as much as the grandeur of the staging. Simply big is never enough -there has to be a very identifiable human conflict for the film to be personal too. GLADIATOR is both epic and personal.

The film boasts a number of fine performances. Carrying on the Hollywood convention of having English actors play Romans is an echo of past epics -a reverent ploy. Joaquin Phoenix, though American, speaks with a British accent too ..Roman emporers in Hollywood films invariably did so! Such details give a sense of nostalgia, or at least recognition -always a key factor in genre films. Another example of genre convention is the ""bad but loveable"" supporting character, in this case played by Oliver Reed. He is an instant reminder of the sheikh in BEN HUR or Peter Ustinov's character in SPARTACUS, and serves the same purpose.

The effects are fortunately never allowed to get before the conflict of the story, but one cannot write about GLADIATOR without mentioning them. I have always been sceptical of computer generated imagery, and I think there is still some way to go before I believe ""totally"" what I see on screen, but GLADIATOR shows a historical accuracy both in the battle scenes and in those in the Colosseum, which can only be commended. I only wish the film had been made and presented in 70mm, for if ever a picture in recent years demanded it, then it was this.",7
17 July 2001,A disappointment,"I've seen this movie a couple of times, and I still don't understand why so many people love it so much. I so wanted to love this movie, but I just don't get it. I really liked the authenticity of the sets and props and such, and the initial fight scene was very good, but the movie bored me to tears! Perhaps I just don't enjoy revenge fantasies. Anyway, I couldn't help watching this and thinking ""Russell Crowe really deserved the Oscar for 'The Insider', not this piece of Hollywood pap."" But the rest of my roommates absolutely love this movie, so maybe it's just me.

I've got to file this movie under ""Movies that were WAY too overhyped"". I may have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been told how incredibly fantastic it was.

2 June 2000,Best movie this summer,"I don't know why everyone is ragging on the plot; even though it was predictable at times, it was still gripping. I think this is the best movie I've watched the whole year; the visuals are just breathtaking. I haven't seen such beautiful cinematography since What Dreams May Come. George Lucas should ask Ridley Scott for some tips because while the special effects in Gladiator were less flashy, I believed it was real. Compare the computer graphics of the cityscapes of Rome to those in (whatever that city was called) in Phantom Menace. Same technical quality, but the stuff in Gladiator was a work of art. My only disappointment was the first battle scene. . . if I had watched the whole scene without turning away, I would have puked. Am I supposed to feel a rush just because they're pulling the film faster? The opening scene in Saving Private Ryan was by far superior. That had me ducking and wincing, Gladiator's did not. The acting was a bit cliche, on Russell Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix's part, but so were their characters. I have to say though, I've never seen a better performance by Phoenix. In the scene where he kills his father, when he was giving that little speech about not being loved, I was moved to tears. That has got to be the most emotional scene in the whole movie . . . and a job well-done by Phoenix. Does anyone remember James Dean in East of Eden? Same speech, equally powerful. I wonder if that's where Phoenix got his inspiration. Overall, great movie. Too bad some people are anti-hype, anti-mainstream, because this film is really worthy.",9
28 May 2000,Stirring film with an impressive performance by Crowe,"This was an impressive film, highly recommended. Russell Crowe has gone beyond his performance in L.A. Confidential and shown himself to be a truly first-rank actor. Maximus is portrayed realistically and vividly, and you leave the film feeling that he really existed and that you met him. Only a stone will view the film and not feel his pain. Russell Crowe makes this film, outshining even Derek Jacobi as senator Gracchus (whose part is on the small side) and Richard Harris as the aged Marcus Aurelius (who seems now always to play himself). Crowe gets my vote thus far for best actor this year. On the whole the film strikes and excellent balance between the action sequences, the power struggles of the empire under a bad emperor, and the passion of Maximus for his family. From an historical point of view, this film does many more things right than wrong, which is remarkable for any film these days. On the minus side, the viewer may come away with the impression that Commodus' reign was relatively brief, but he ruled from 180-192 C.E. What the film does best in those terms is to portray aspects of Roman religion, in Maximus' devotion to his household gods. Some may be disappointed that there are too few actual scenes of gladiatorial combat (the film's title is somewhat deceptive) but I think most viewers will find this a relief. The film is violent but it does not dwell on the violence needlessly, and many opportunities for gratuitous depictions of violence were wisely skipped. Add to this an impressive and haunting musical score and you have a wonderful movie.",8
10 July 2001,A movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film,"I love good action films, the kind that entertain and enthrall, and every once in a while leave a viewer in awe. I love gladiator movies. Since childhood, I have been a fan of swordfighting and swashbuckling melodramas, as most young boys are. There is nothing wrong with the fun in them, because every once in while a great one like ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"" comes along, a truly epic film that not only pierces the eye, but the imagination as well. Those films were not just spectacle, but had real heart in them. They contained stories that worked with enough good writing and direction to move beyond just a popcorn flick. The film ""Gladiator"" did not. I know people love this film, that even many critics called it a wonderful success. In that light, I tried hard to like it. I sat down twice in the theater and once at home to give it an honest look, but sadly, a new revelation never came. At best, it is just an action flick, and since I love these types of movies so much, that label saddens me all the more.

Here is my argument. Many claim that the action scenes were the best they had seen. I thought those claims were simply caught up in the flashy technique that was used, but not the resulting experience. Director Ridley Scott used quick cuts and blurry hand-held camera work to film the fighting scenes, copying much of the same style that Spielberg introduced in ""Saving Private Ryan""'s opening sequence. It places the viewer almost inside the battle with the same kind of confusion that a soldier might feel. All fine and dandy in a modern battle that uses guns and explosives, weapons that require little skill to use or watch on screen, but in mid-evil warfare, I would like to actually see and understand the fighting with swords that takes a focused camera to capture. It can be done. ""Braveheart"" gave scenes just as strong in action, and much more understandable. those scenes were enthralling, and are still the standard in my opinion. Sadly, every action scene in this movie was much the same: blurry, quick cutting, not easy to understand, and therefore not easy to enjoy. I wanted to scream at the screen ""Just let me watch the fighting!!!"" This movie was not trying to make some great statement about war or its time, like the Spielberg film, and therefore did not need to go all artistic for not reason at the moment the crowd is supposed to sit back and enjoy the ride. Since the action let me down so much, it was now the job of the plot to pull me along.

There were many things that worked in this film concerning the plot. The actors were very good, particularly Richard Harris in the beginning as Caesar. Many scenes worked by themselves, but did not really add up to a complete picture. Often I felt like the characters were acting a particular way not because the story had given them any real motivation to, but because the plot required it for the moment. When Maximus was needed to be mad, or noble, or depressed, or vengeful, or hopeful, or hopeless, he simply was. The man was a rollercoaster of emotion in this film, but his reason for being such was not consistantly shown. A plot cannot drive the characters, it must be driven by them and what they would actually do if they existed. While it was all handled well by Russel Crowe, a fine actor, it made me feel manipulated as the viewer.

Overall, it was a popcorn flick, a movie to entertain, but to challenge, and certainly not to win an Academy Award, the worst presented in years. The special effects were very noticable, made so to appear ""wowing"", but they detracted from the reality instead of enhancing it. I do not understand why people think ""Gladiator"" is greater than it is, a movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film, unlike other films that were nominated right along side of it.",6
1 August 2000,Russell Crowe gives another great performance!,"Gladiator is an awesome movie with an awesome cast and an awesome director. Starring Russell Crowe in one of his better roles, Gladiator combines the blood/violence of Saving Private Ryan, the story of a Ben-Hur type deal and grand acting to create a web of decite, lies, fights, and death.

Russell Crowe is a well respected general - Maximus. The beginning is like Saving Private Ryan, where the barbarians and the Roman fight each other until one of the sides happens to fall, (the barbarian Germans.) Maximus, after the battle, meets with the emperor who tells him that he is dying and giving the empire to his control. When the emperor's son hears the news, he tries to do all he can do to get the crown (played by Joaquin Pheonix.)

In order to gain control, the emperor's son takes the lives of Maximus's son and wife. Maximus becomes a slave/gladiator and learns from one of the best gladiators of all time to regain his freedom - he has to win the spectators before he can win the emperor. Later in the story, Maximus meets up with the new emperor in the Colloseum and the story goes from there.

Russell Crowe gives another Academy Award worthy performance. Gladiator is one of the best films of the new millennium!",9

7 August 2022,Epic in scale and also delivers with an unexpected dramatic punch. Gladiator delivers where you want it.,"Overall: 7.73

Epic in scale and also delivers with an unexpected dramatic punch. Gladiator delivers where you want it, with big bloody battles in the coliseum and with a convincing and compelling protagonist at the center of it. Good supporting cast and Derek Jacobi as Gracchus was an awesome ode to Roman film lore and something hardcore film geeks will appreciate. Although probably not historically accurate by all accounts, the film is thorough in detail of look and feel of Rome and architectural replication. This movie is light on story and political jockeying that makes other stories of Rome. Instead it focuses and surprises with emotional weight and drama that does not feel out of place. A little lackluster in structure/pacing and cheap acting and writing at times but all in all an epic adventure that shouldn't be missed and is a great rewatch as well. Also, incredible score that will last with you long after the credits.

16 November 2003,one of russell crowe's best,"Gladiator captures the realism and authenticity of the roman era. The filmmakers were very accurate with the costume designing and the coliseum was even built from scratch for the film. The acting was superb, especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.

A great story about a roman general who was betrayed, and brought back to live out the rest of his days as a gladiator. ***1/2

13 August 2003,A grand epic ¬ñ told by a master storyteller.,"A grand epic ¬ñ told by a master storyteller.

Sit back and watch a master ply his craft.

As noted by previous reviewers - director Ridley Scott's cinematic masterpiece explodes onto the screen with the force of Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan' ¬ñ with the best battle scenes since Gibson's Braveheart.

This film is an epic tale of one man's loyalty, betrayal and revenge - - against the backdrop of Rome at the height of her glory ¬ñ and brutality. Director Scott weaves an intricate fabric paralleling one man's fight for justice ¬ñ and a nation's struggle for freedom ¬ñ both cumulating in the final battle between one just man and the deific ambitions of a megalomaniacal Cesar.

Sit back too ¬ñ and take a lesson in acting from the old master Richard Harris. His `whispers' are more powerful than another man's battle cries.

Then too ¬ñ take a lesson in acting from the new masters Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. These two actors can do more with a glance or a tilt of their head ¬ñ than most actors can do with their whole bodies.

Last but not least ¬ñ was Spielberg's Dreamworks ¬ñ being the icing on the cake. Director Scott was exceedingly careful in not making that all too familiar mistake of letting the special effects overpower the story line. DreamWorks' `unleashing hell' in the opening battle scenes ¬ñ through to the recreation of the Coliseum in all of her terrible splendor was truly captivating.

Throughout ¬ñ there was not one weak link throughout the movie. Supporting actors and actresses were the best in the business. Derek Jacobi and Connie Nielson never disappoint. Plus ¬ñ I'm at a loss for words to describe the visual impact of Ralf Moeller and Sven-Ole Thorsen.

On a parting note and in scanning some previous comments ¬ñ I'd like to observe that those folks ¬ñ who have been nurtured on Kung Fu flicks - - will be understandably disappointed in a film of this depth and breadth ¬ñ and realism.

In summary ¬ñ a truly captivating and entertaining movie - - with perhaps its greatest strength being that it forces one to give ample pause to reflect on one's own life and life goals.",10

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
2 June 2000,Yeah lot's of problems- but on the Big Screen- Total Entertainment!!,"A quite impressive take on the Roman epic, but very Hollywood. By that I mean it uses cliches of celebrity heroes pandering to cheering audiences and slimey bad guys, both without much complexity or shading, and a fairly predictable plot. Ridley hasn't really tested our intelligence since Blade Runner (if you don't include the 1984 Mac Intro Super Bowl Commercial). Still the visuals are stunning, the dialogue at least bordering on eloquence at times. The battle and forum scenes are terrific even with the enervating slo mo's and some apparent computer generated enhancements. It's the type of film that you can see with your father as a kid and remember for the rest of your life, which makes up for whatever it lacks in sophistication. ABSOLUTELY necessary to see this on a large screen, with a 'big' sound system.

18 August 2000,Boring,"""Gladiator"" did not contain a single moment which excited, surprised or moved me. The plot is mind-numbingly predictable; the special effects tacky and the visuals dreary. Russell Crowe's superb acting was the only redeeming feature. He will star in many better films than this.

1 June 2000,Worth seeing in the theater,"I expected Gladiator to be mediocre thematically, perhaps a cross between The Matrix and Spartacus. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised. Although I cannot give this film an overwhelmingly positive endorsement, it certainly is worth checking out in a theater. Its greatest strength is, of course, the visual effects. Ancient Rome is recreated so beautifully that my jaw literally dropped during some of the scenes. Additionally, there are some great battle scenes, including a large, ""Braveheart-esque"" affair and smaller, gladitorial encounters. Overall, it's the kind of brutality you can really sink your teeth into (ie, it's stunning visually and lighthearted enough that you don't really feel bad about being entertained by it).

The plot is a bit silly, and the film drags at points. Without the awe-inspiring eye candy, this movie would be merely decent. As is, this is a fine film that foreshadows the kind of film making we can expect with the astronomical increase in special effects quality.

21 May 2000,"I hate Ridley Scott, ....but I mean that in a nice way.","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

7 May 2000,Epic that pays homage.,"The movie ""Gladiator"" filled pretty much up to my expectations. It had wonderful photography and visual effects, probably one of the most enjoyable movies to look at of the 90's. The action sequences are tense, suspenseful, gut-wrenching, slick, and above all, violent. Russel Crowe's talents, unfortunately, are somewhat wasted in this part, since primarily his part is just to fight and be brave. He does do this little well, though.

The plot of this movie is reminiscent of countless other epics. Emperor has doubts about who to give his throne to, and his unexpected decision stirs up jealousy in those not chosen (Ran). So unchosen decides to run off the one chosen and tries to kill him, though the chosen somehow survives, while the unchosen believes he is dead (though not an epic in practical sense, The Lion King, and possibly others). The chosen finds his wife and son dead and vows vengeance against the now king (Braveheart). He is instead, though, sold into slavery and enrolled in a gladiator school (Spartacus). There, he is put on display in a colosseum to compete with others for the audience's amusement (Ben-Hur). He rallies up support, but after being betrayed by his own people, he is caught by the king (Braveheart again). Then, there is an ending which I'm not quite sure what movie it is from. I must not have seen it yet. Alright, so maybe the movie is going to win any acting or writing oscars. It probably doesn't deserve them anyway. However, the scenes in the colloseum are so beautifully and skillfully crafted, that the academy still should grant ""Gladiator"" oscars for Best Director Ridley Scott, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, and maybe, just maybe, best picture. We will see.",7
17 February 2001,A Must See Film,"Its a good thing ""Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator"", were not out in the same year, I think it would have been a first time duel for Best Picture.

I did enjoy this film greatly, but I had trouble with the basic plot, that is, the suppose killing of Maximus. His men were very loyal to him, and his right hand man ""Quintas"" was not in the Pretorian Guard,(who protects the Emperor), so for him to turn against Maximus is just not believable, during the Roman empire in the years A.D. it was the army who plotted against the Emperors and in many cases put their Generals as emperors.

Be that as it may,its a story of the destiny of men ""when death smiles at you, all you can do is smile back"", as we will all dead, its the when and the how.

This is also the third film that had this special type editing, I don't know what to call it, but its like a slow motion, speeded up editing process that's quite unique.

This movie has a message here and its all to real",9
7 May 2000,"3, count 'em, 3 writers on the screenplay!","If for some reason you are forced to see this movie (heavy sedation and the like), the costuming was sensational and the soundtrack is fantastic - try to focus on that.

Otherwise,the plot (!) is cumbersome, the excessive violence is tedious, the paranoid emperor thing is boring and the hero against all odds has been done to death.

Not even Derek Jacobi and Russell Crowe could carry this albatross.

This movie was the greatest fighting movie since braveheart (excluding Saving Private Ryan) They say it was so gory there was just a lot of blood that is all. The fight scenes were spectactular. Once this movie comes out on video i will buy it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

10 June 2002,"Great Acting, Profound Story","This movie truly deserved to win Best Picture. Ridley Scott does a magnificent job directing, and the acting is stellar from the entire cast. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla is particularly enchanting, and really looks the part of Roman nobility. She embraces her brother the emperor, but schemes against him at the same time. Joaquin Phoenix is also captivating as the callous and callow, yet fiercely cunning Emperor Commodus. The late Oliver Reed is wonderful in his part as the former gladiator Proximo, who earned his freedom. Russell Crowe is very good as Maximus. He portrays the strength, pride and dignity of a Roman General very well, and rightly maintains that facade even when he is reduced to gladiator/entertainer/slave status. The score by Hans Zimmer is appropriately haunting, as this is a heartbreaking film. It hurts to see Maximus lose his family, and become an outcast from the society he loved. It also hurts to see that refined society transformed into a bloodthirsty mob who live for the games orchestrated by a petty tyrant not deserving of the title emperor. Gladiator is very much a tragedy. I found it amusing that one major critic said he didn't like it because it didn't have enough blue skies and bright colors. Ok, I guess you didn't get the point of the movie. For everyone else, I highly recommend Gladiator, especially on DVD (which includes Ridley's informative commentary track on the making of the film).",10
28 October 2017,"Wow, a historical drama I actually enjoyed. A lot.","Literally bloody brilliant.

Well directed, beautiful-looking, and with an interesting story to match, finally a great gladiator movie that's the real McCoy.

Also, it has a good performance by Russel Crowe.

Also, it's not Master and Commander (thank God).

25 July 2002,"An intense, well-crafted movie about one man and a fading empire.","""Gladiator"" ranks high among movies about Roman times, ""Spartacus"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", ""Quo Vadis"" come to mind. The movie maintains its uniqueness among these heroic sagas in the way it affords us a view of those times and men in those times. The panoramic scale the movie maintains to set us up and bring us into the parts of the story is breath-taking. The camera shots of the protagonists makes sure the viewer is held firmly and moved surely through the plot. The intensity of the final confrontation is brought by sheer force of the way the viewer is brought to this point. For people who enjoy movies, this is an event that must not missed. On a personal note, the opening scenes were a bonus to students of Caesar's Gallic Wars. If you have always wondered, like me, how those battles (strategies & tactics) were fought, this is the answer.

27 January 2015,Gladiator,"This title does a good job in combining slight story complexity, historical background and action scope. It's been a while since release and time hasn't been tough on quality. The battle at the beginning continues one of the best ever crafted. Sometimes people tend to underestimate the value of drama a film occasionally has to receive not to be deemed shallow. This isn't simply about blood- thirst of the Colosseum crowd, it focus on the relationship between a general and it sking, how this king seems to favor the general instead of his own son to be next Caesar of the great empire of Rome.

When the son kills his father and takes on the throne the general is cast out and his family brutally murdered. After a series of events he ends up a gladiator and seeks revenge against the king. Sure the scope is taken to a hole new level for stuff like battle between the two, a king and a gladiator.

The general expertise in battle grants him a considerable high status upon so many victories as he climbs his way through. All in all the movie seems accurate in whatever history is left to back it and as entertaining as an action movie that thrives to go beyond simple carnage.",7
10 May 2000,"A great action movie, though not a great movie","Well oil me up and call me a Roman, Gladiator was a most enjoyable action movie. The plot was actually non-trivial, Russell Crowe had a wonderful screen presence, and the violent action scenes we well shot and were genuinely exciting.

However, don't mistake this movie for Great Cinema. It isn't. This is a Hollywood-spawned crowd-pleaser, a ""Roller coaster of a movie"" that will ""have you on the edge of your seat."" While the plot was non-trivial as I said, it had few surprises and is not particularly interesting, though it did its job of wrapping the action scenes extremely well. The characters also do their jobs; unfortunately, without much flair. I would rate the thinness of the characters as this movie's worst flaw; the bad guy is wholly bad (they even make him a sexual deviant to drive the point home). The good guy is wholly good - plenty of reinforcing the ""loves his family"" angle to show what a wholesome fellow he is. The other slaves are eloquent, good-natured, stoic, and dignified. If you were sold into slavery, beaten, starved and then told to be hacked into little pieces for the amusement of others, would you be so likeable? Me neither. The wise emperor, the faithful servant, and anyone else you care to name, are cardboard cutouts.

So, don't miss this one at the cinema. A most pleasing way to while away a couple of hours. I just wouldn't expect to see anyone quoting it in a year's time.",7
9 May 2000,BEST EPIC SINCE CONAN:THE BARBARIAN AND BRAVE HEART!,"GLADIATOR***1/2[3 1/2 STARS]-Best epic since ''Conan: The Barbarian (***1/2) and ''Brave Heart"" (***1/2). There's an excellent story and the acting is great despite theres not a huge cast except for Russell Crowe. There's an awesome battle scene at the beginning of the movie plus some awesome sword fights and some great bloody action in the arena. The ending was also pretty awesome. This is a nice comeback for Russell Crowe since ''The Insider"" (**) which also made kind of a mess for Al Pacino who made his comeback in ''Any Given Sunday (***1/2). I've never been into Russell Crowe but he was awesome in this movie and I hope to follow up on more of his movies. If you want to see a great epic go see ''Gladiator''.

22 May 2000,"Gladiator is a ""true"" blockbuster!","Get ready for a visually stunning movie that will touch your soul, make you cheer, and make you cringe all in one shot. When the royal highness isn't getting his hand kissed by the people, and when the camera doesn't pan above the Roman Coliseum, and when you aren't truly feeling involved in this simple but wonderful story of a brave general turned slave turned Gladiator, you are cringing every time a sword cuts into a man's flesh. Even the violence was visually stunning. This movie (and I won't give away too much), has a battle scene comparable to that of Saving Private Ryan's opening battle. Although not as long and drawn out, it brilliantly sets the tone for a movie 2 hours and 34 minutes in length which seems like and hour and a half when it's all done. Kudos on the casting job. Crowe delivers with a bang and he is proving once again that he belongs here. Give him a part and he will play it, much like the rest of the LA Confidential alumni. Gladiator is a film of potential epic proportion. But it won't become an epic unless people make it that way. It's a wonderful cinematic experience not to be missed by anyone who would appreciate a movie of this caliber.

12 May 2000,The Star Wars of the Gladiator Movie.,"This excellent film succeeds on many levels. All of the other comments already deal with it's many attributes. But I think the film also may be ultimately seen as a beginning of an entirely new approach on historical movies from this age.

Just as Star Wars redefined how we saw futuristic films, this film may do the same for the gladiator film.

22 May 2000,It looks like star wars but is much more disappointing.,"Is it likely that emperor Commodus fights in the arena with a gladiator (although wounded) who already proved himself Rambo plus Terminator? Is it likely that one can make a general disappear in the middle of his army without arising the slightest suspect or reaction in an era in which emperors were made by armies? Is it likely Marcus Aurelius standing few yards away from a risky battle like general Lee on a cliff overlooking a Civil War fight? Nobody wants a movie to be absolutely consistent and historically correct, but a shade of inner plausibility is always required not to look ridicule. Besides, all can be forgiven as long as it's entertaining. But all you can save in this mess is a bit of digital architecture which seems dej√† vu after Star Wars, and battles (although edited in a dizzy way): the rest is boring, the screenplay childish. Scott is running out of inspiration (like the last De Palma and the late Kubrick), cinema has less and less to be proud of, and I like Ben Hur better.

18 June 2000,This is why we go to the movies...,"I finally went and saw the movie with my girlfriend on a whim, although I have been wanting to watch it for awhile. While waiting for the film to start, I noticed the usual groups of movie hooligans coming in, and I was expecting usual hooting, laughing, and loud talking that make modern movie-going a torture. From the opening scenes to the final ending, I never have experienced such a silenced crowd as I did last Friday night.

The movie was brutal, relentless, tragic, and funny. The audience were deer caught in the glare of an oncoming freight-train. Two and a half hours later, upon noticing my girlfriend silently wiping tears from her eyes, I realized this is why we go to the movies. Not to compare and nitpick the movie the way these silly, silly people with no lives tend do, but to immerse one-self into the story and stunning visuals that very few movies in our generation have been able to do. Thank you, Ridley Scott, for giving us a reason to go to the movies again!

21 May 2000,As an historian. . .,"As an historian I can't resist commenting on the movie. I teach a course on Roman history and frankly. . .I LOVED IT! Granted, as in all films, they run right over most of the historic details (such as Commodus ruled for 12 years and did not die in the arena but instead was strangled by a wrestler) but what the heck, it was other things I was looking for. I've visited Rome several times and was stunned to see the relatively good accuracy of recreating the arena, especially the details such as the awnings. One of my students who traveled to Rome with me was by my side at the movie, and when the scene first shifts to the arena we were on the edge of our seats, noting the details and were thrilled, pointing out where we had stood. Nor did Scott go 50s Hollywood with thousands of gladiators fighting it out at once, the games were terribly expensive and even in Rome a fight with fifteen or twenty on a side was a big show, except of course for the famed dedication of a water works project during the reign of Cladius were supposedly five thousand fought in one day in a fake naval battle.

If you want to catch a sense of what Rome really looked like, the sense of the power of the cult of gladiatorial combat, and visually what a Roman army looked like (though not quite fought like) this film will do it. And, as well, if you want to get a bit of a creepy sense that you too might have been seduced by the power of the games, as the character of Oliver Reed so beautifully explains, then definitely see this film.

The battle sequence at the start was stunning and incredibly well acted, though I still wait for the day when the moment of contact between the opposing sides is done correctly, with mass formations, shields overlapping, piliums (heavy Roman javelins) flying. But yet again, what the heck, it was pretty darn close!

I hope Gladiator sets a new trend towards films set in other historic periods and with it the effort to recreate the look of that time. I know that a lot of my more stuffy peers will sniff, whine about details etc. but when you are trying to motivate a 100 level freshman survey class, this film will spark the interest and get the questions flowing, which can then be directed into ""real"" history.

One question though and I hope someone responses. Was it me or did I hear the battle chant from the movie Zulu? Zulu is one of my favorites and I could swear that twice I heard the banging of the shields and battle chant at the very start of the movie when the Germans attacked. Let me know, its been bothering me.

Enjoy the film",
20 May 2000,A major disappointment.,"This movie fills in all the criterions for a ""Hollywood movie"". A hero, his wife and children, death of his family, a new lover, powerful enemy, the rise of goodness and the fall of evil. Only thing what was missing is the dog of a happy family. What a clich√©. The beginning was promising; the battle against the barbarians was convincing and realistic enough, but then... rubbish. The drama was hilarious, and the fights turned into sci-fi. Later in the movie happened the climax of the disappointment, the blast of (good old American) morality, when Crowe should have killed the other gladiator but was way too good-hearted. After killing thousands of barbarians and dozens of other gladiators he felt merciful. The rest of the movie was about as boring as ""Titanic"". Take my advice, and save your money, this film is a success only in USA, that tells a lot about any movie.

28 March 2001,Epic tale of power struggle in Rome set c.180 AD,"The opening scene of gladiator is a telling moment in the movie. General Maximus is thinking of being home on his farm with his family. This thought is captured in the picture of Maximus running his hand through ears of wheat while standing in a field planted with that crop. The scene cuts to Maximus in a forest in Germania on the eve of a battle, for a moment he sees and contemplates a robin as if with a friend, this is man of interesting qualities. What follows is a bloody battle sequence in which Maximus kills and maims and is nearly killed in turn. Life for Maximus is brutal, cruel and dark and yet we have seen he is not. Who is this character?

Enter the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Richard Harris on a good days work, to congratulate Maximus. Cometh also the emperors son, Commodus and daughter, Drusilla, effectively the royal family, and a retinue of Roman politicians. How does Maximus deal with the political intrigues of a great empire, he fights wars is the answer so he doesn't need to. But now he is placed in a position where he must take sides. He becomes a victim of intrigue and ends up a slave, a gladiator living with the possibility of death, daily.

Gladiator is the story of the intrigues of Rome, of Maximus' fight for revenge and how one man can defy an empire. Spectacular in its settings, with the city of Rome and it's Colliseum recreated with computer graphics as a backdrop, Gladiator is big screen cinema. The stunning images of director Ridley Scott capture a gritty and harsh time while displaying the beautiful light and colours this director is renowned for. Incorporating bloody battle scenes set to the equally impressive musical score done by the experienced Hans Zimmer and enchanting music of Lisa Gerrard, this movie is the work of a good team who know how to show the talents of their craft.

Coming in at just on two and a half hours in length, Gladiator is the tale of slave versus master, of a spirited man versus a man twisted by power into a hateful tyrant, of worthy leadership against fearful controlling ambition. It is a film of great drama, with spectacular set piece battle scenes interspersed with intelligent dialogue and interesting and plausible characters. It is not necessary to undergo a crash course in Roman history to appreciate the story, which is heavily dramatised and largely fictitious, though the impact of the civilisation of the time needs to be appreciated if the movie is to suitably interest you.",8
11 May 2003,Proof of Hollywood's value to society,"This is what movie-making is all about! No pc soapbox, no one trying to convince you to follow some socialist utopian agenda, just pure, undilluted storytelling! And, Ridley Scott (screwed at the oscars) delivers with this cinematic masterpiece!

Crowe is phenomenal as Maximus, the hero of the story. Maximus is driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge, yet beneath that burns the love for the dream of Rome, shared by the former emperor (Harris). But, Joaquin Phoenix (also screwed at the oscars) turned in one of the most disturbing portrayals of evil in moviedom. Commodus (played by Phoenix) can't be purely hated--look at his upbringing. But, his actions can ONLY be hated. And, the threat he poses to his own people cannot be settled through talk or appeasement. One cannot reason with insanity. They are, by nature, unequivocable, and Maximus/Commodus portray these elements beautifully.

The characters are believable, played perfectly, and the story is impeccably blended with action, drama, and even romance. This is easily the greatest movie produced in the modern era!",8

18 January 2008,Magnificent,"Ridley Scott created a classic that will go down as one of the greatest movies of its genre. The acting is superb all the way down, from Russell Crowe truly being Maximus to Djimon Hounsou plays magnificently what is one of many memorable performances. Joaquin Phoenix is a compelling antagonist, as Commodus, and in every role I cannot picture anyone doing a better job then what was done by the actor in that role.

The story pulls you in and doesn't let you go until the last second of the film. Maximus' cause becomes yours, if he fails then so do you. ""The general that becomes a slave, the slave that became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor,"" sums up the story perfectly and takes you through each of Maximus' highs and lows.

Everything about this film screams spectacular and it is completely deserving of any praise and awards that it has received.

This one is a classic",10

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
10 January 2007,"Gladiator, proves that love prevails above all","Gladiator for me is Ridley Scott's finest work. It is credible to state that alien was fantastic but for me this is his greatest achievement in film. Gladiator holds a message within which is never give in, or give up when your cause is worthy, and we can see that Maximus's cause is more worthy than any. Crowe is nothing short of world class in portraying to us the character of Maximus. Yes he is a born fighter and general of Rome, yet he loves his family more than anything and only wants to live peacefully with them. It is because of this that the audience can understand Maximus's drive for redemption, regained respect and vengeance for his family. The battle scenes for me show how Maximus fights with his heart and nothing else, he slays the fighters for his family, he wins the crowd for his family and gains his vengeance. Lisa Gerrard's ""Now we are free"" creates an overwhelmingly emotional end to the film and had me in tears for the first time ever in a film. Gladiator is nothing short of a masterpiece and shows that despite all the endless rubbish that has come out of Hollywood over the past ten years there are still gems and films to remembered for a long time, and Gladiator is certainly one of them.",10

1 April 2001,Best Actor? Best Picture?,"The fact that the immortal Cary Grant never got the nod from the Academy should clue us all in as to their thought process. Gladiator was an entertaining film, but its characters (yes, every one of them) had all the depth of department store mannequins.

Worth watching? Sure. Worth all the accolades it received? Hardly.

Crowe or Grant? Uh huh.

5 February 2001,Entertaining.,"Gladiator started out with a bang: an intense battle scene, followed by some nice interaction between the characters. After that, the movie devolves into a comic book level romp through the ancient world -- the characters become cartoonish, and the plot becomes predictable. Entertaining yes, but no more so than Conan the Barbarian (which is arguably the better picture).

9 May 2000,"Terrific film, interesting portrait of Roman empire...","As a history buff, I had a lot of fun with ""Gladiator.""

The actual plot for Gladiator was nothing new. As a matter of fact, it ""borrows"" a lot from ""Macbeth"", ""King Lear"", and ""The Odyssey."" And some of the dialogue was trite...

On the other hand, it's probably the most realistic depiction of the middle Roman Empire in film to date. The use of CGI was outstanding, specially the reconstruction of the Colisseum.

I enjoyed the minor details a whole lot: the dresses in the Roman empire had more to do with how people actually dressed in the Middle Ages, than the greco-roman ""toga and sandal"" vision that Hollywood created. Also, notice how the nobility wears blue colors: it was the most expensive color for fabrics, since very few things in nature have that pigmentation.

I enjoyed seeing the palaces with actual furniture, (unlike in classic Hollywood), and the nobility using glasses and glass utensils. Romans were incredibly skillful at glassworks. Unfortunately, only a few pieces have lasted until today.

It was also quite impressive how the movie starts by showing you why the Roman Empire was so powerful and lasted so long: their technology and war machinery was ages ahead of the rest of the known world. Most of Europe was still living in tribal societies. As we can see in the opening scenes, the tribes of Germania barely entered the bronze age when they got beaten by Roman war machinery.

And of course, I appreciated that the main character, Maximus, is not from the Laetium (Rome), but from Spain, one of the provinces of the Roman Empire since about 100BC. Spain, Portugal and Southern France (Hispania, Lusitania, and Galia) were the second most important provinces of Rome.

Spain was kind-of like their ""Cambridge, Mass"": they sent their future Caesars, senators and Emperors to the many Roman universities in Spain (Salamanca, Complutum, Caceres) and military academies. Even Julius Caesar, for instance, was educated in Spain.

With its minor flaws, ""Gladiator"" was definitely a great show, highly entertaining as well as educative.",9
3 July 2014,A movie I could watch over and over!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",8
3 August 2000,"A Remarkable Epic, and the best in it's genre......","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a success on so many levels. It's a wonderful epic, an intense action/adventure, a touching story of redemption, loss and betrayl, and an all-around rousing entertainment with glorious scenery and atmosphere. Though it's clear that digital computer effects play a part in serving the scenery, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. In fact, it enhances it. The performances are top notch, particularly from that of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix, who is deliciously diabolical as the villian. The battle scenes are simply some of the best ever created for cinema, ranking in the same league as Braveheart. This and M:I-2 are the year's best offerings so far, and by far the best films of the summer.

3 June 2000,As the Crowe Flies,"Okay, I haven't seen a gladiator movie in a long time, but, I thought they were all rather simplistic. Sword and sandals epics, they√ïre called. Togas and tigers. Chariots and fire. Arenas and amphitheaters. Columns and colosseums. The new movie, Gladiator, is chance to see all that stuff. That was about what I expected. Not a day at the beach.

You have to remember the genre. The filming expenses became greater than the box office totals, so, they haven√ït made this kind of movie in almost 40 years. The subject matter is violence. Got that? A gladiator fights to the death. Therefore, the main course here is bloody, hand-to-hand combat, served with war, duty, ambition, murder, injustice, betrayal, and revenge, with small side orders of politics and philosophy. And for dessert, more blood and death. A friendly word of advice? Don√ït sit in the first two rows. By today√ïs standards, it has to come out different than what√ïs been done before. It comes out dark, somber, dour, gloomy, and computer-generated. Yeah, I really miss those light-hearted films about ancient Romans and barbarians, too, but what do you think it was really like? I know I wouldn't want to live back then. Neither would Kirk Douglas, Charleton Heston, nor the late Victor Mature, nor the late Steve Reeves, I'm guessing.

This movie is getting mixed reviews. I suppose it could have been better in some ways, but that really depends on what you√ïre looking for. It√ïs a tragedy, not √íthe feel good movie of the summer.√ì Do some people just not get that? This may be the reason for the conflicting opinions. It doesn√ït matter if you know the story ahead of time. Just don√ït expect to be uplifted and spiritually renewed. All I expected was good acting and some entertainment value. I spent $4.50 at a 1:30 p.m. matinee, and can say I was entertained at times, and certainly didn't feel it was a waste of time and money. Not at all. The ones who get short-changed are women. Their roles in these kinds of movies are nearly always dumb. No exception here.

Russell Crowe is always good. He is the movie. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that at times he sounded exactly like Mel Gibson, especially in a rare split second when a line of dialogue was delivered with his back is to the camera. Must be the Aussie influence. His commitment to his work, both physically and mentally, is amazing to watch. We have far too few, and can never have too many actors like that. Somebody said they√ïd pay money to watch him stand around and drink beer. What greater compliment is there?

Somebody has to play the bad guy. Joaquin Phoenix has the perfect look for the part, and seems committed, but ends up looking like he√ïs in over his head. Okay, he got this acting job to do a movie with none other than Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. That might be a bit intimidating, no? It would be hard for most of us not to look like we suck sharing the screen with those guys. It√ïs a part for a young Roddy McDowall type, and Phoenix did provided the insipid total psychopath needed, but nobody in this movie was even allowed to have any fun.

The late Oliver Reed√ïs farewell performance was excellent. I loved him in the Musketeers movies of the 70's, and was glad to see him working until the end. That√ïs one way to go, isn√ït it?

I thought the special effects were rather seamless, though some of the landscapes do look like gorgeous computer paintings. Though no doubt it makes Rome look better than it was, I thought it strange that I never saw an aqueduct, nor any sunshine. I couldn't tell that England wasn't Germania, and Malta, where a lot of this was shot, is really one awesome-looking place. As far as the action, I noticed from the first battle scene that they had so many fast cuts and too-close close-ups, and so much shaky camera crap that it was mission impossible to actually follow what was happening physical-action-wise from moment to moment. That bothered me, but I doubt they wanted to be too graphic too soon, and figured they first wanted to give a basic feel for the violence, rather than glory in the bloody details. Maybe it was a ratings thing, too. It wasn't quite as guarded later on, though still sometimes challenging to watch.

This a must-see, even if it√ïs just to make up your own mind about the highest-grossing movie of last weekend. You can decide for yourself. That√ïs the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.",

21 May 2000,Dull,"I'll admit it -- I had a tough time paying attention to this movie. Time after time during it's weary 2.5 hours my mind would start to drift away to more interesting and substantial things. This movie is unfortunately nothing more than a dull remake of Braveheart. It has all the stock characters in place: rugged, down-to-earth hero, his slain family, the princess who loves him and the effiminate prince who hates him. The whole movie was filmed in a murky indistinct way, and half the time you couldn't tell what was going on (except in the oddly lucent ""floating"" flashbacks when everything seemed very computerized and unreal). There are no high points of emotion in ""Gladiator""; an epic movie needs ecstatic joys and breathtaking lows, but all this movie gives us is grim unpleasantness, which is not fun to watch. I don't know why there's so much crowing about the acting here: everybody does what they're required to do, but nothing extraordinary happens that couldn't have been done by thousands of actors across the country.

27 June 2000,Wonderful Stuff,"What we do now .. echoes through history...

A true masterpiece from director Ridley Scott, Gladiator has everything a epic movie could wish for. From the battlefields of Germania to the Gladiatorial contests of the coliseum.

It stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a brave Roman General who is betrayed by the evil Emperor Commodus. Left for dead he is rescued by a Gladiator trainer( played by the late Oliver Reed) who trains our hero as a Gladiator. He eventually fights his way to the Coliseum in Rome when he confronts his enemies and his destiny

Everything about this movie echoes pure class. The battles, the sets, the direction. The cast is superb especially Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and our own Richard Harris as the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius.

What the author really loved about this film was it's authenticity. Ridley Scott shows the filmgoer what Rome must have looked like at her height, decadent but wonderful. This film is a must for anyone who enjoys real entertainment, after all isn't that why cinema was invented.",10
9 May 2000,"Action ... and a story, too!","""Gladiator"" is a good movie without being a great movie. It's not that it had any huge flaws in it, it's just that it never built upon itself. Instead of getting more and more powerful with each battle and each scene of intrigue, the film just resets itself to its previous level. This effort to keep itself in check is what kept the movie from being ""great.""

It started with a great battle and, like I said, just cruised along after that. It had no grand climax, just a quiet ending.

The story is intriguing -- a tale of treachery, revenge and triumph -- though I'm told it was lifted from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire.""

Technically speaking, ""Gladiator"" is intriguing. Here's why:

>>>Unlike Roger Ebert, who criticized it's muddy tones, I thought the use of two major colors -- blue and brown -- was impressive. It helped bring it together thematicly if you think of it. Blue for the sinister politics and brown for the Maximus' battles.

>>>Another interesting thing was the use of snakes. Just before some of key gladiatorial battles in the film, they always showed people playing and taunting snakes. Perhaps it was director Ridley Scott's way of saying if you mess with Maximus, you get bit.

>>>Particularly pleasing is that Christianity or Judeaism wasn't in the film at all. Why? Because every other film I've seen like this makes a point to show that it was the hero's religion that made them the good guy. In fact, ""Gladiator"" goes out of its way to show Roman/Greek religion as it was truly embraced by the Romans. It was a nice touch.

And finally one minor criticism: A recent cliche that has surfaced in movies about ancient times is that the villain is always considered sexually deviant. He's a homosexual. He's in love with his mother. He wants to sleep with his sister. He's a sadist.

Why is this? Isn't killing people in cold blood a good enough reason to be a villain? Why do the writers have to continue their ""character development"" into the sex thing?

4 June 2000,"Not an epic, but entertaining nonetheless.","Gladiator turns out to be a fairly standard revenge story, but one that is good enough so that if you're reasonably willing to be entertained, it will have you cheering for the good guy in the end. The story is not all that deep, and while none of the characters except the bad guy are really fleshed out all that deeply (they're pretty much all stock), you are given enough of the story to make all of the characters' motivations quite believable. The movie occasionally attempts to make a social or political statement, but never really delves into the meaning of it very far before the story changes gears. I was quite impressed by the effects, though, and enjoyed being given the architecture of Rome in her glory than just seeing lots of things blowing up (some shots of the Colosseum are quite impressive). When the action is on, it is good with some exciting, if hectic, fight scenes. But this is not an action movie by any stretch, with the fights really being few and far between. The actors and actresses all turn in very good performances. Crowe's character wasn't called on to display a wide range of emotion or to show a serious internal struggle, as his ""job"" is made quite clear from early on. But he still commands a strong presence onscreen and easily becomes a hero you feel good about rooting for.

While not quite what I'd call an epic, due to its fairly straightforward (though far from dumb) story and lack of a strong message, I was still highly entertained and left quite satisfied at the end. If you're looking for serious subject matter or deep characterizations or loads of action, steer clear. But if you're not overly cynical when a moviemaker is just trying to entertain you, this will most likely be an enjoyable experience.",7
11 June 2000,Hands-down My Favorite Movie,"I loved this movie! Terrific in almost every aspect. I thought the plot could have been a little better, but the acting, fights, settings, and everything else makes up for that!!! Russell Crowe delivers an excellent performance as the main character. Joaquin Pheonix is a superb villain, much to my surprise. Again, an outstanding film. I'm sorry, but if you didn't like this film, get your thumbs out of your ass and go watch it again!!

22 May 2000,"A decent, though somewhat shallow film.","Transient thoughts came to be the call of the day as I sat at the theater watching ""Gladiator."" Not because the subject matter was prosaic, for that was not the case, but rather, due to the film's longevity and amateurish characterization techniques.

Despite the abundance of events taking place throughout the course of the story, by the end of the movie I felt cheated in the sense that the conflict and main characters themselves lacked what one may refer to as ""soul."" The former half of the movie presented an excellent backdrop for the final battle that was to come--but unfortunately, it all quickly collapsed from there as the characters displayed stagnant traits that went on far too long, and were elaborated upon far too little.

At one point, it is mentioned in the movie that the crowd is fickle; it will revere a winner one day, and have forgotten about him the next. The movie accentuates the fact that by winning the crowd, you can win your way to the top. Yet I found it difficult to believe that after two fights, Maximus had become the champion of the people. And I found it even harder to believe that after two fights, the viewer was supposed to regard Maximus in the same light.

A quick rule for emotional storytelling: Allow the viewer to be capable of relating to the character through his actions and feelings. Dismal demeanor along won't do a thing if the viewer cannot realize that the character is as human as them.",8
13 June 2020,Gladiator,"Although we cannot choose fate, we can choose how to face death. Today I saw a slave stronger than the Roman emperor. You have written to me four first virtues, wisdom, justice, perseverance and temperance. When I saw it, I knew I didn't have these virtues. But I have other virtues, father. That is to let me surpass others' ambition, resourcefulness and courage.

7 January 2001,"Big and very exciting, but ...","This movie has lots to admire and little to like. Its many plusses ¬ñ spectacle, beautiful photography, action galore, superb effects ¬ñ create only sporadic involvement. Its popularity may be based on the fact that its defects are overwhelmed by its vast scope. But look behind the on-screen uproar: the hero is an empty symbol, the linear story goes straight as an arrow from event to event, and the tiny amount of real feeling (other than excitement) is introduced artificially. The music seems to belong with another film. Russell Crowe, as the gladiator, is more stolid than heroic. Acting honors go to Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Emperor Commodus. (Accent on the first syllable.) At the climax, the script soars completely out of control, creating the movie's single authentic surprise. The emperor, a deranged weakling, ensuring that he holds every conceivable unfair advantage, pits himself in the arena against Rome's greatest gladiator. Even the delusions of the real Commodus weren't quite that insane, and the vision of Phoenix vs Crowe in the Coliseum is outright ludicrous. Perhaps it isn't possible to make a epic of this scale that can create any emotion beyond a feeling of awe. Possibly many of the defects are in the genre, not in the movie itself. But by all means see it, revel in the spectacular images, and don't think about it too intensely.",
16 June 2000,"Hardly original, but terrific entertainment","""Gladiator"" is not an original film. There's tons of comparisons to ""Braveheart"" floating around, but there's dozens of movies that came before, and dozens more will come that have this same basic story. Sympathetic powerful man is wronged by those around him, loses everything, comes back to attempt vengeance against the forces that destroyed him. Frankly, there's much better comparisons than ""Braveheart"". ""High Plains Drifter"", ""Rob Roy"", even films like ""Payback"" just to name a few of many.

But this is unimportant. A film like ""Gladiator"" is not about originality. It's about sweeping vision, high production value, and engrossing entertainment. And ""Gladiator"" achieves all this extremely well. You'll hardly believe 2 1/2 hours have gone by when you reach the end of this film. The portrayal of ancient Rome is exciting and believable, the story is predictable yet gratifying, and the directing is interesting without being distracting. I particularly enjoyed the rapid cutting of fight scenes, which Ridley Scott has managed to make both exciting and excruciating without showing excessive gore, and without highlighting fake swordplay.

While I think the cries of ""Oscar!"" only serve to illustrate how haphazardly Oscars are handed out, the performances are very good. Joaquin Phoenix is particularly effective as the despicable, creepy, yet pitiful Commodus. Russell Crowe is an excellent fit for our grimy hero, and Connie Nielsen lights up the screen with her refined beauty and presence.

Ridley Scott has demonstrated his slick professionalism as a director in a way that has not been seen since ""Blade Runner"". ""Gladiator"" is a big movie, and it deserves to be seen on a big screen. Go to the theater before it's too late, there hasn't been a movie as deserving of a big screen and big sound since ""Titanic"".

I rated this movie 9/10.",9
8 September 2000,"Great special effects, shame about the story","As we can expect of a modern blockbuster, the special effects, cinematography, acting, and music are all brilliant. Unfortunately we also get a very implausible and predictable plot. There are lots of very showy fight scenes, but they were all so long that I rapidly found them boring.

28 May 2000,Behold! Braveheart with that cop from L.A. Confidential!,"If there's one thing that gets to me while I browse through movie reviews, it's pedantic, bitchy rants about ""historical inaccuracies."" I'll be honest--SCREW HISTORY! You don't go to the movies for a history lesson; you go because you want to scarf down popcorn while seeing two people kick the flying crap out of each other! Intelligent movies are the ones you watch at home... with the exception of Gladiator. Sure, some people can say that it's all action and not much else, but compared to the rest of the action epic crop, Gladiator pumps the most brain power out of all of them. Name another action movie this year that makes you wanna go ""ick"" at Commodus' incestuous advances towards his sister. Name another action movie this year that almost brings your critical ass to tears when General Maximus comes across the ashen remains of his old life. To end it all, name a Roman epic that tops Ben-Hur and Spartacus in spectacle, and you have Gladiator. Sure, Kirk Douglas would beat Russell Crowe into a body cast, but I'll go with Ridley Scott's prettier, CGI-powered Rome. And it's by DreamWorks, which is always a good thing in my book.

7 May 2000,remake of Fall of the Roman Empire,"What nobody's noticed is that this is basically a remake of the 60s epic 'Fall of the Roman Empire', with Alec Guiness, Sophia Loren, Christopher Plummer and Stephen Boyd. While 'Gladiator' has great acting and a surprisingly involving story, not to mention amazing action scenes, the older film beats it in one very important area: producer Samuel Bronston rebuilt the Roman Forum in Spain, so the sets are real. 'Gladiator' is all digital and looks it. There's probably not one bit of natural light in the entire film. That's too bad, because otherwise it's very entertaining. As for 'Fall of the Roman Empire', it's pretty dated, but it's also one of the most visually stunning films ever made and has a GREAT Dimitri Tiomkin score. Try to see it letterboxed if you can.

12 February 2001,A Great Film...But Not As Good As Awards Make It To Be,"I watched ""Gladiator"" last night to see if it deserved to win over ""Traffic"" at the Golden Globes. And while I still think ""Traffic"" is better, ""Gladiator"" still proved to be a really good film. However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.

The story begins in wartime b/w Rome and Germania. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is the general of the Roman army, and he leads them into battle. To sum it up, they kick major Germanian army booty in a really bloody battle (if you are intensely disturbed and grossed out at this point, don't continue watching the film). Anyway, the Emperor of Rome currently is all proud of Maximus, and it turns out he really admires Maximus after his good work all these years, which, of course, sparks intense jealousy from an already ""bad dude"" Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the current emperor's son. So when Commodus becomes Emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. But Maximus dodges being killed, returns home to find his family dead, and then while wandering around lost, he's picked up by some salesmen and is held as a slave. He's then sold as a gladiator. The rest of the story chronicles him being a gladiator that sort of teaches Rome with his fighting and rebellious ways to be more powerful than the Emperor...which Commodus isn't too happy about.

This was a better movie than I thought it would be. The story was good: it was creative, pretty, touching, and interesting all rolled together.

The acting was exceptional. Russel Crowe captured the intensity of Maximus' feelings and displayed them well for the audience to intake. Connie Nielsen was convincing as Commodus' sister. But the best performance in the whole movie was Joaquin Phoenix as the nasty Emperor of Rome, Commodus Caesar. He gave his character an evil that was seen through coyness and nastiness, both blended to give Commodus that bad guy touch that really makes you fear and hate him...and yet he seems so innocent at times. The only other time I've seen a performance like that is when Topher Grace played slimeball Seth Abrams in ""Traffic"".

I loved the cinematic artwork in this movie, namely seen during the first battle in the story. The camera dissolves and movement were all used to just make you say, ""Wow!"" throughout the whole movie. I also liked the color usage: blues for outside scenes at the beginning battle, brownish oranges for inside, brightness in the gladiator arena, and darkness surrounding the Emperor. These techniques managed to turn a summer popcorn movie into a piece of art that can be appreciated through many movie goer's eyes.

This film is definitely in my top 5 of 2000. While I personally think ""Traffic"" is the best film of the year, I won't ask, ""How much money was under the table?"" if this movie wins the prize.

I give it an 8/10, being it was a little overly long. Length wasn't the problem; after all, ""Traffic"" was 147 minutes and I loved every minute. But unlike ""Traffic"", ""Gladiator"" got really boring at times and I found myself looking at my VCR clock a little too constantly.",8
4 February 2001,Great film!,"First, I must admit bias. Any film dealing with ancient Rome stirs my interest. I had no problem, whatsoever, with the CGI in this film. Rome has never looked so good! The sets, costumes and acting are all of superior quality. The score, by Hans Zimmer, is beautiful.

Now, if you want a history lesson...read a textbook. Just as Titanic was a fictional story within a factual framework, so to is Gladiator. Few films dealing with history are accurate. View Gladiator for what it is, a grand spectacle and a great film.

24 June 2001,Maybe It's Better On The Big Screen,"I have probably missed out on a good part of this film's appeal by only seeing it on video, which medium doesn't really preserve the grandeur of big battle scenes and scenic vistas. Still, I can't imagine the acting or dialogue would be much improved by seeing it in the theatre, and watching it at home allowed the viewing audience to guiltlessly engage in an ongoing game of Spot-The-Cliche. That interactivity and Joaquin Phoenix's OTT performance actually kept us more-or-less tuned in for the full two and a half hours, which puts this ahead of quite a few blockbusters and/or Oscar winners in my personal top ten thousand.

2 August 2001,"Good, but a poor man's Spartacus","""Gladiator"" is a good action movie, but it's overrated. The battle sequences in the Colisseum are excellent, but outside of those scenes the film moves too slowly and is too long. I rate it 7. Russell Crowe's character is fighting for an ideal that is never really explained (what - a slightly less oppressive Roman Empire?), and so some of the drama seemed thin to me. Basically, Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" (1960) does everything ""Gladiator"" wants to do, and does it much better (including the fact that Spartacus is fighting for the more noble cause of ending slavery).

There is rarely a movie that I can watch over and over but this is truly one I can because every time you watch it there is always something else to see. The scenery is great and the music is wonderful. I think this is a must see movie.

24 April 2001,Falsification of history,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",4
30 May 2000,The Roman Epic returns in great style,"I am very glad one of the best Hollywood directors (just remember Blade Runner and you understand what I'm saying) decided to advance on such a project supported by a great studio.

This movie proves the Roman Epic is back in great style. The ambiance an production design created in all scenes is fantastic (from the battle in germania to the fights in the arenas). The Emperor is a very interesting and troubled character magnificently portrayed. Russell Crowe is a sort of a Mad Max of Rome. The dream scenes are magnificent and I could go on and on. What makes this even more interesting is that this Roman Epic shows Rome without Christians, and focuses on their thirst for bloody spectacles (the arena shows given to entertain the people).

Don't miss this fabulous film if you love the Roman Epic.

26 March 2001,Best picture? Please.,"Both ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Traffic"" were far superior movies, and both will be hailed as enduring classics. Glandiator will continue to make money in rentals and retail purchases, as its star has undeniable appeal to women, and the action is certainly watchable, so it hits both sectors of the market. But Best Picture of 2001? Pleeease.

3 January 2001,A brilliant film!,"All I can say about this movie is that it is absolutely brilliant. The story is strong, the acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix) is exceptional, the fight scenes are thrilling, and the computer generated Rome is great. This is hands down my favorite movie of the year, when I first saw the previews I immediately was interested, there hasn't been a Roman epic in Hollywood for years, my expectations were high and it delivered! Everything from the incredible cinematography to the powerful score fit the movie perfectly, this is a great movie, I give a 10 out of 10.

30 April 2000,"Crowe, Scott shine in mesmerizing epic of revenge","By far the best movie of this year and best action-packed epic since Braveheart, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" shines from the start to finish. In fact, this movie is so mesmerizing that it's worth the price of admission to just go and look at the beautiful images. Gladiator, however, also features excellent performances (especially Crowe), a great script, and action-packed, fast-paced battle sequences. These battle scenes are very exciting including an opening Saving Private Ryan-esqe style forest battle and several unique gladiator fights. Yet, the movie's success goes to 2 people: Russell Crowe, who will probably be nominated again for an oscar, as the tough, rough, and seriously ticked off general/gladiator Maximus and Ridley Scott, who returns to great form after average movies like GI Jane. So see this movie when it comes out, as it deserves to be seen at least once on the Big Screen.

28 April 2000,Cecil B. would be proud...,"Great movie! I would see it again if only for the well realized environments. Ridley Scott has done for Rome what he had done for the L.A. of the future in Blade Runner. The battles are intense and sweeping. The arena contests are brutal and well staged. Many nice little cinematic touches.

Russell Crowe is again exceptional and believable in this role. He conveys his feelings with a subtlety where there could have been much scenery chewing and gnashing of teeth. He allowed me to care about Maximus. A lesser actor would have been lost in this production, there is so much going on. To be honest there is some heavy melodrama but that would seem to be inherent within this genre. And in spite of some slow and indulgent stretches there is actually some injection of sly humor. Joaquin Phoenix actually humanizes his evil character who is nonetheless in the end, evil.

Gladiator is a spectacle, larger than life and this is why we go to movies. Isn't it? See it.

27 April 2000,Cecil B. would be proud!,"Loved this movie. It is clearly a throwback to a long dormant genre. Not perfect mind you, it has it's flaws. Those flaws would be inherent in any movie of this type. Heavy-handed melodrama, and obvious indicating of good and evil. Not much that is subtle here. But, y'know it is a Roman empire/gladiator movie, right? Russell Crowe has shown he can carry a movie, and he carries this movie superbly. Man, he's good. There is clearly a sly sense of humor at work in many of the performances. Joaquin Phoenix is very good as Commodious the evil emperor, he almost makes you want to empathize with him. This is the late Oliver Reed's last role he will be missed. The action is very well done and this movie is violent! (no guns) Ridley Scott directed Blade Runner and what he did for L.A. of the future he does for ancient Rome, nuff said. Great opening battle scene. Aside from a couple of slow spots and its inevitable though historically inaccurate ending, this is a great movie! See it!

24 December 2000,"S'alright, but only that.","An all right but not very worthy heir to Roman epics like Ben Hur and Spartacus, Gladiator runs overlong for its meagre story and fails to dazzle with pitifully poor fight scenes. It has a good cast and a decent plot, but there simply isn't enough of anything to keep one's attention for two and a half hours. Some judicious edits and a new choreographer would have served this piece extremely well.

15 November 2000,Breath taking,"This movie is excellent. It's graphic, yes. Too much for my taste, but the fact that this is one of my favorite movies says a lot in that the graphic nature of the fight scenes doesn't diminish my enthusiasm for the wonder of this film. All parts are cast well, right down to the young son of the Caesar's daughter. Usually child actors' inability to act distracts me from the plot, but this boy didn't steal the scenes nor did he deliver unbelievable lines. He was just there, and that was good.

I would recommend this in the theater but also to own at home. Its message isn't preachy, its story is captivating.

5 May 2000,A movie made the way movies should be made,"Anyone incredibly disappointed by Star Wars Episode I should do themselves a favor and see Gladiator. This movie recalls the greatness of the original trilogy. Like Star Wars, Gladiator has no big stars, opting instead for very talented actors who do not happen to be famous. Gladiator has a terrific hero and villains worthy of the name. The battle that Maximus wages is both personal and epic, and the amazing backgrounds that the story occupies create a very real world. This movie is immersive unlike any other movie in a very long time. Where Episode I failed to give the audience characters they could care about or a plot they could decipher, Gladiator keeps things simple, elegantly depicting the conflict without clutter. The plot is a combination of a royal drama similar to Shakespeare's plays, and an Anglo-Saxon battle epic. Everything works, and just as Lawrence of Arabia makes you thirsty, this movie makes your pulse pound.

19 December 2022,A Modern Day Classic,"This is easily one of my most viewed films that I've seen over the years. I recall good memories watching it with old friends in high school and family members alike. The story is written well enough where it keeps you inthralled and the fighting and action sequences have aged well for a movie that's over 20 years old.

The acting is really good. Characters are engaging and likable with the villain leaving a sour taste in your mouth. The CGI has aged a bit in some scenes but it's not not distracting enough to really take you out of the film. I recommend this film for anyone interested in gladiatorial history.

15 June 2000,"Not a classic, but still a winner","This movie was not without faults (the one that first comes to mind is the thumb-out, thumb-in error), but none of them are worth recommending for anyone to see who can stomach a lot of violence. The plot is far from original, a betrayed warrior's wife and children are murdered by the new Roman emperor and he goes through hell and highwater to meet him in the obligatory fight scene climax.

The characters in this movie are good enough, but they are always so sad. I think Russell Crowe only smiles once, but then again, his life is in shambles. Joaquin Phoenix (who should be praised just for taking a role whose character's name is Commodus) suffers from some sort of twisted form of the Oedipus Complex. All of the supporting cast do a good job of filling their roles even though they're basically invisible. Just throw-in characters to feed the plot between Commodus and Maximus. And I'm not sure everyone's accents are consistent with how they actually spoke back then, considering the era.

What the picture lacks most, though, is special effects. A movie like this should strive to serve up eye-candy, but instead it looks like second-rate computer graphics. I was expecting a glorious view of ancient Rome, but instead the colisseum looks drab, almost like someone snapped a photo of a video game using high speed film. Even the scenes that show flashbacks and past emotions look... easy, for lack of a better word.

But I must praise this film for its engrossing qualities. Any movie over 2.5 hours in length is subject to get boring, or at least experience a lull somewhere during the middle. But not Gladiator. The character development is sufficient and it makes us care about the characters and what happens to them. The battle scenes are passable, and the director wisely uses choppy editing techniques to disguise the sword fighting abilities of Russell Crowe and others. Usually that's not a good sign, but the point here is to see and feel the intensity and vengeance that Maximus fights with, and it works.

So based on what I wrote in the last paragraph I'm recommending this film. It is by no means transcends its genre and probably will not be considered a classic, but it does well as a stand-alone movie, and it is entertaining.

20 June 2000,A TRUE RIDLEY SCOTT MOVIE,"Ridley Scott who is in my opinion one of the greatest movie directors in Hollywood history is back in form mixing style and substance very cleverly to deliver a movie that will catch your heart and your imagination.It is quite similar to Braveheart actually since the story does involve a fallen soldier seeking justice.

Scott who did not have a very goodtime in the nineties except for Thelma and Loiuse is in top form here and showing everybody what is talents are whether it is action drama or beautiful sets.Jaquain De Phoinex gives a very convincing and admirable Performance as the spoilt Prince.Costumes are beautiful and I will be very suprised if it does not get an Oscar nomination.

7 May 2000,A LONG LONG time ago...,"The first and most important thing I need to say about this movie was that it was too freakin' long!! This movie could have been made within the typical hour and forty-five minutes to two hour range, but two and a half hours is just unreal. Honestly I found this movie to be a little on the dry side. Not all the scenes connected and I found myself trying to concentrate more on what was going on rather then enjoying the film.

Russell Crowe offered an excellent preformance as did Connie Neilsen and Joaquin Pheniox. The cinemotography was wonderful and the costumes were outstanding. These are really the film's only redeeming points. The plat was dull and somewhat tedious. It took two hours to finally get to the point of the movie. There were many extra scenes that could have been eliminated because they really had no point. The fighting scenes were well done, and there was a few scenes that had the emotion in it, the emotion that I am sure was supposed to placed throughout the entire film, yet was not. I would have to say that this was not one of my favourite films, but if you are planning to see it, then definitly go to the theatre, because with the specatuclar scenery and fast paced action sequences, this one needs to be seen on a big screen. However, if you are looking for a movie with a more gripping plot, more emotional acting and something worth your money, then you may want to look elsewhere, because ""Gladiator"" just doesn't cut it. I give it a 5 out of 10.",
9 May 2000,Excellent,"I went into this movie thinking Braveheart. It is not at all like Braveheart, which by the way is one of my favorite movies. This movie is just as good but totally different. I thought the casting was excellent and there was plenty of plot and story. The special effects are amazing. I would highly recommend seeing this in the theater. I think seeing it on a TV would lose too much of the splendor of this film.

And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
8 May 2000,Cash the check Russell and get on with it.,"Gladiator is Ridley Scott's attempt at a Quo Vadis/Ben Hur for the year 2000. Scott has been responsible for some rather good films, i.e.Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise. He has also done some TV commercials that are dazzling. Gladiator is beautifully filmed, although the special effects are labored and somewhat annoying. It is basically a popcorn epic without a thought. What holds the film together is Russell Crowe's remarkable presence. Together with Ralph Fiennes he may be the most talented screen actor before the public today. The camera loves his face and the soundtrack his voice. Supporting his efforts is a cast of absolute perfection. Connie Nielsen as the quasi- love interest is not a great beauty, but is hypnotically interesting. Joaquin Phoenix as the resident ""mad hatter emperor"" leaves no scenery unchewed in a sort of Freudian twist on the genre. They are backed by a veteran British cast of absolute perfection: Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, a bloated David Hemmings and the late Oliver Reed. What in the end makes the film come a cropper is dialogue from the screen writers that is utterly laughable. You won't be bored by the film, but I wish Russell would just cash the check, ( I hope it is a large one), and get on with his appropriate business of making first rate films that can make use of his enormous talent.",7
14 March 2005,A bit of a dog with some highlights,"Hard to understand how this uneven flick won the Oscars it did. Russell Crowe has moments, but they are all of a single mood. The sets are tacky (think how gorgeous they are in Fall of the Roman Empire with Loren and Plummer), the cinematography is strangely muddy, and the story leaded.

The exception is Joaquim Phoenix's compelling reading of Commodus. The first time Crowe and fellow slave gladiators fight in the arena, Phoenix eclipses the scene with his convincing depiction of blood lust. One could watch the film again just for those few moments of insight into a genuine character.

25 May 2000,"Titanic in a Coliseum-and I wasn't a fan of Titanic, either","Normally, when I comment on a movie, it is to encourage someone to see some little ""gem"" that I think was overlooked. This time, I'm going against the grain. I didn't HATE Gladiator; the production values were great, the directing good --- I guess it was mostly the story, and (believe it or not) the acting that I take exception to. In my summary, I called it ""Titanic in a Coliseum"", and I wasn't kidding. I found Titanic to be an okay, but overlong movie. That's how I found Gladiator. Actually, it wasn't tremendously long...but about three-quarters of the way through, I found myself glancing at my watch. I simply didn't empathize with Crowe's character...I found too many thing ways way too under-explained (like his becoming a slave...no spoiler, they tell you that much in the trailers), and I also didn't find many of the supporting characters particularly charming me. All in all, I'm probably one of only three or four guys in all of North America who didn't love the movie. But again, let me make it clear...I didn't hate it. It simply didn't ring my chimes. The plotting was murky at crucial points, the sound track too ""Titanic-y"" (that soft, ethereal music just didn't cut it for me), Russell Crowe simply didn't impress me all that much, and neither did most of the other stars of the show. Sorry. Not a thumbs down, but I won't be rushing out to buy a copy.",5
12 May 2004,An Amazing Epic!,"Ridley Scott demonstrated his excellent directorial skills in this epic movie. Opening with a wonderfully choreographed battle scene, Scott manages to integrate the personal strife of Maximus with the exciting action sequences, all set with the political backdrop of late-Empire Rome.

Of course, when talking about Gladiator, one cannot ignore the powerful performance of Russell Crowe as General Maximus - 'Gladiator'. His icy stare, bold delivery, and convincing stunts and fight sequences made him a deserving winner of the Oscar in 2000. Crowe is well-contrasted in the movie by Joaquin Phoenix as the ruthless Emperor, longing to expand his own glory, while ignoring the needs of Rome, and the wishes of his father.

One aspect of the movie that is less publicized is the musical score. Hans Zimmer did an excellent job putting together a score that captures the emotions of the movie and fitting with the historical background.

My problems with the movie? Really only one: Maximus is too perfect. Is that a reason to dislike the movie? Not at all. Just being nitpicky really. To me, Gladiator had all the right tools and made the most of them, and that is why I think it is one of the top movies!",10
14 May 2000,It Coulda been a Contendah!,"Overhyped!

Gladiator is perhaps the most frustrating movie that I have ever seen. Expecting either an action-adventure popcorn movie, or Braveheart 2 I sat down with baited breath. However, the opening battle scene was completely uninteresting except for the special effects firepower. Then the movie slinks into a long series of poorly written scenes that serve no thematic purpose (no matter how much they pretend to) but are only there to forward the plot. I was almost entering REM sleep when the movie shocked me awake with something very strange, a well-written scene. Once Crowe is sold into slavery, we finally get some movie magic working. Oliver Reed and Djimon Honsou enter with well written characters and powerful screen presences. Strangeley Crowe's, Phoenix's, and Nielson's characters suddenly become more interesting as does the plot. The battles begin to have meaning, as does every word. I exstatically awaited the ending... only to see the writing go back to hell and end in a poorly handled, overly simplitic, and flat out bad ending. In 3 hours I saw a bad pseudo-epic turn into the next braveheart, only to give way to an ending only found in a bad action movie. The acting is fine, Crowe is a commanding screen presence and can bring dignity even the most horrible of lines. Reed's performance is gripping and wonderful, as is honsou in a very small role. Nielson is dignified and beautiful, Phoenix's characterization oscillates as much as his role does, but he is effectively complex and twisted. Unfortunately they were all wasted on a Great script wrapped in a horrible beginning and ending. It's worth a peek, but it should not be an Oscar contender.",7
15 September 2012,Gladiator + Ridley Scott = Masterpiece,"Masterpiece doesn't even begin to describe this film. General to slave, slave to gladiator, gladiator to ?. The story is beautiful, the cast is fantastic and the acting is amazing. Not to mention the directing. Ridley Scott is placing himself at the top of the Director food chain with yet another great film. Russell Crowe is Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix is Commodus, the battle lines have been drawn and let the war begin. Not just for country but for the love of a father. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are so good in this film it is truly a shame that they will not be around to entertain us in the future. Gladiator shows us that a well written story and a well acted and directed movie can transport us to another time and place. That in the middle of battle, feelings like love and compassion are still there. The love for women, fellow man and family are the strongest of bonds and are not easily broken.

20 May 2000,"Entertaining...but not a great ""Roman Epic.""","Russell Crowe - very good performance. Great fight/battle scenes/tiger shots etc and even the special effects worked well - cool shots of the Colosseum. The film however lacks the quality of other Roman epics such as ""Spartacus."" Apart from Russell Crowe and Richard Harris, the other members of the cast weren't too impressive.(perhaps due to poor dialogue and lack of character development).

Contrast this to Spartacus - Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton and of course the fantastic Peter Ustinov (best supporting actor Oscar) - what a cast! Yet again like so many other films - music was unnecessarily included in scenes where silence would have been far better. Especially that early scene in the film (*spoiler alert) where Marcus Aurelius tells his son (the irritating Commodus) that he will not become Emperor. What follows is is a way-over-the-top emotionally charged sobbing scene with highly dramatic music involving two characters we hardly know. Its as if Ridley Scott is shouting at us ""You must feel emotion here!"" - ridiculous - the viewer doesn't care about Commodus at this stage of the film! - it made me cringe instead. Btw: What was with all those ""flashbacks""?

The choice of music was iffy at times and the ""incest"" overtones - how did that help the film? The character of Commodus was poor - extremely annoying at times (like a brat) and cowardly. Apart from all that it was an entertaining film - it was an epic in terms of duration but not in quality. 7/10.",8
12 August 2000,Absolutely amazing.,"Many of my friends and I (who at our local high school are probably considered the nerdy group--and couldn't care less) anticipated this movie since the first time we heard of it. One of my friends, who styles himself as a Roman history buff, was sure that the movie would stretch the truth in favor of entertainment value. Sure he would grumble the whole movie, the rest of us drew straws as to which would have to sit next to him opening night, and it was of course me. He grumbled all the way there, but once the movie started, he was silent the whole time. He found stuff he could nitpick after it was over, but while the movie was rolling he was in as much a state of awe as the rest of us. This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen, enough so that I saw it three times in theatre. I seldom see movies multiple times, exceptions being Jurassic Park(4 times), Independence Day (2 times), and the Matrix (2 times). I usually love science fiction movies beyond all others, but I can say I enjoyed this movie more than any sci-fi blockbuster I've ever been too.

15 December 2004,"Welcome to Rome, again. Please keep off the grass and watch the games.","'Gladiator' is one hell of a film to behold. This is one demonstration of the powers and wonders of film making. The original that defined the modern sandals and swords. Some how its hard to imagine anyone else other than Russel Crow as Maximus. Even by the likes of Lord of the Rings, the visuals; the story; and the characters hold together. Yeah, it's not perfect (loads of goofs to find if you like ruining films) but what we are still given is a movie that is nothing else than pure drama. To hell with the anachronisms. By the time the movie is over, you'll have forgotten all about the fact you could see the gas cylinder in the back of the chariot. For 2 1/2 hours, believe you are in Rome. Believe you are sat in the ampitheatres watching blood games. I think 'Gladiator' is well worth its experiences. And i will admit. 'Gladiator' is the only film where the ending brings a tear to the eye every time. Troy might be a wooden horse and that other Roman movie, King Arthur might be stuck on the wall. In my opinion, Gladiator will always have the heart where it counts and thats what matters most.

Alright, 'Contenders ready. Gladiators ready. 3,2,1...fight'

30 July 2000,Words cannot do this movie justice,"I went to see Gladiator fully expecting to be completely bored out of my mind. Instead I came out of the movie with a new all-time favorite. I can't decide where to start on what I liked most. The acting was absolutely brilliant. I have a great amount of respect for Russell Crowe now, due to the strength and compassion he put into this film. However, I feel that Joaquin Phoenix did the best job in acting. He took a character that could have been one huge cliche, and turned him into a sadistic and cruel villian that you actually had a reason to despise.This preformance alone has turned me into a huge fan. All people involved in this film are deserving of any awards they might receive. The manner in which the film was shot was breath-taking. From Germanian forests to Rome, the scenery in this film is amazing. I am also a huge fan of the soundtrack. Rarely has a soundtrack nearly brought me to tears, but this one does almost any time I hear it. Listening to it alone brings back emotions that I've never felt listening to a soundtrack. It's about time that there is a film out there now that makes you want to cheer for the hero, hiss at the villian and see the movie over and over again. Hopefully Hollywood will follow suit with more films like this in the near future.",10
9 January 2001,I wanted to be thrown to the Lions after 20min of this movie!,"Many have said that this movie was full of action etc. And that the acting was superb etc.

Well the acting might have been good and the action scenes may have kept my attention for a minute but this movie was so boring and so wrong, in terms of historical content that it isn't funny.

To begin with the king,Marcus Aurelius,does not get killed in his tent but on the battle field by his ""son"". He is stabbed not hugged to death.

Also the term Spaniard wasn't used for at least 500 years after the Roman Empire fell. Spain was still Iberia hence anyone from Iberia would have been called Iberian. It may seem anal to some but they could have at least gotten those facts correct. I realize that Maximus Decimus Meridius is a fictional character and therefore this movie is part fiction but it is also part non-fiction and they could have at least tried to get the facts right.

I was disappointed to say the least, DON'T waste your time!",
8 April 2001,This is the Best Film of 2000,"I'm really sure that many people will agree that this film will be the best film of 2000. Great acting, great story, great action, great directing and great score. This film won the 5 Academy Awards of 2000 including Best Picture and Best Actor. Russell Crowe was cool as hell in this movie and Ridley Scott did amazing job directing the action scenes. This movie was my one of the best film I've ever seen. This movie's DVD rocks too. If you want to see great action, great drama, see this movie. This movie will rock you.

I don't care if the film is historically inaccurate, but a best-picture nominated film should at least exhibit coherent writing and competent art direction. I guess as long as your decapitating people with swords, you don't have to make a good film to win an oscar. Ken Lonergan must be gnashing his teeth. Oh well, at least Erin Brokovich got nominated.

28 December 2021,great,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard.

10 November 2002,An Amazing Masterpiece!,"Gladiator is one of my most favorite movies of all time. You can't

help but sit back and go 'wow'. I purchased this movie along with

Shrek, Moulin Rouge, Tomb Raider, Braveheart, and Black Hawk

Down. Gladiator is deffinatley better than Braveheart, but I can't

seem to see if this movie is better than Black Hawk Down,

probably is. Everything is great in this movie. Acting, directing, editing, music,

and of course, story. It starts beautifully and ends beautifully. The

action sequences get your adreneline running and the ending

almost made me fight back tears. Something movies don't usually

do to me. Take my advice and watch this movie, it's one of my

favorites. 10*'s/10*'s.",10
20 September 2000,Overrated and over-computerized,"I saw Gladiator at a sneak preview in New York and I must admit, I walked away disappointed. I felt that the battle scenes at the beginning were too computerized and pixiliated--they just zoomed by so fast that the audience did not have a chance to see what is going on. Someone later made the comment to me that, ""Well, isn't that how you would experience a battle?"" And I would have to saw, I don't know, I've never been in one. But compared to the opening sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (not a perfect movie, in my eyes, but the opening battle scene was far superior to Galdiator's), Gladiator's battle was all whiz-bang, wham-bam, with no emotion. I whispered to my seatmate that it was too pixiliated and he whispered back, ""That's how they cheat,"" which pretty much summed it up.

As went the opening battle scene, so went all the gladiatorial scenes--all speed, no substance. I couldn't even tell how the Russell Crowe character won some of the battles, they were whipping by so fast, with such fake, fake computerized effects. To compare, a couple of days after seeing Gladiator, I saw Sparticus on the big screen. There is only one gladiatorial battle, yet it is much more exciting, suspenseful and real than any of the Gladiator scenes. I CARED what happened!

On a postive note, I did think Joaquin Phoenix's performance was fantastic, as were all of the performances. The computerized amphitheater was also pretty cool looking. Too bad the film makers felt that the computer could somehow take the place of realisticly choreographed gladiatorial fights.",5
18 March 2011,Gladiator: A breathtaking epic from Ridley Scott,"After a jubilant start to his career, I wasn't too impressed with Ridley Scott with his films. They sure were epic pieces, but they usually weren't masterpieces. I wanted to see something visually dazzling and also very good in every other aspect. Gladiator was a perfect example of that...

This breathtaking epic was visually sophisticated, well-made, and brilliantly acted. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with the brutal battle scenes, scenery, and characterization. This is truly his best film.

The performances are perfect and ravishingly powerful in every way. Russell Crowe simply took the daylights out of me with his outstanding performance as Maximus. The guy was literally born for the role! Joaquin Phoenix is creepy and mesmeric as the evil Commodus, remaining perfect the whole time. The rest of the cast is also great...

Overall, Gladiator is probably the best medieval epic you'll ever see. This is mainly because of Ridley Scott's brilliant direction, the outstanding performances, and the Oscar-worthy battle scenes. A must-see that deserved all the Academy Awards it got!",9

To live a simple life as Husband, Father, and Farmer. He had served his Country to the fullest and all He asked was this one request.

When Marcus Aurelius, the current Emperor asks him to serve his country even further, Maximus is torn between Love of Country, and Love of Family.

Commodus; Marcus Aurelius' Son, assumes he would be the next Emperor. When he finds his Fathers plan would be to have Maximus Heir to Romes future, He Shows his own true allegiance is to himself. He Kills his own Father, then makes it known to Maximus, his intention to have The Generals Family killed as well as having him executed.

As fate would have it, Maximus escapes, heads home to save his doomed family, only to find he is too late. He wishes life could be over and he could then be reunited with his loved ones. His last resolve is to live in this World for Vengeance. Righting the wrong that was done to him. He ends up doing more then this. Righting the wrong that was done to all his countrymen. Giving them a chance to save their families as well.

4 May 2000,"Maybe it's the genre, but this movie was awful","I thought the film was atrocious. Part of this was the mob

mentality that pervaded the college theatre where I saw it, with

hordes of frat boys cheering and applauding at the goriest

scenes. Do they not realize they are just like the Romans in

this sense? I couldn't believe some of the dialogue that was

allowed to come out of characters' mouths. Some of the special

effects were interesting, particularly the construction of the

Coliseum, but the sped-up look of the scenes was extremely

irritating. This film just seemed thoughtless and predictable,

while not particularly entertaining or insightful. Definitely

not worth 2 1/2 hours or $8 for the price of ad",3
12 March 2001,"Well recorded sound on DVD, little else","I rented Gladiator (1) to try out my new home theater speakers (upgraded from ""2.1"" to ""5.1"") are any good and (2) to see if Roger Ebert is right, whether this could be the worst movie ever to win the ""best picture"" academy award. The answer to both my questions is ""yes.""

Wow, this flick really sounded great on my stereo, dts encoding a special treat! Even the perfunctory and unremarkable ""epic music"" sounded good. I was able to tune up all 5.1 of my speakers, so don't touch my levels, I got them set just the way I want 'em. And now, the bad news.

Gladiator is overlong, overdirected, underscripted, and totally forgettable (aside from a being DVD showcase). It's hard to make a good epic. Spartacus this ain't. Moreover, as good as the sound was, the visual effects looked artificial. The tigers in one of the fight scenes were particularly cheesy. In the action sequences, it looked like the actors were filmed as they moved slowly, and then were restored to real speed through mechanical/digital means... this makes everything well focused, but ironically, a perfectly focused swinging forearm w/broadsword looks more like claymation than reality.

The acclaim of this movie doesn't astound me--people like gladiator movies. Indeed, all I kept thinking of as I watched was Peter Graves' line from ""Airplane"": ""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"" Hey, at least I got a laugh when I thought about this... 2.5 hours of total humorlessness is tough on a viewer. ""Saving Private Ryan"" had more laughs than Gladiator. Oh wait... the exploding firebombs in the opening fight scene had me howling. I love anachronism.

Such an oh-so-serious tone should be saved for the likes of Schindler's List or Judgment at Nuremberg. Gladiator fails at profundity. In trying to be an action flick, it fails worse--it's an hour too long. As an ode to history, I have no idea--I have problems identifying, much less cheering for, the ""good Romans"" of the reign of the Caesars.",3
28 May 2001,Overrated and derivative,"To give Gladiator its due, the music is good and aspects of the filming are also much above average. Unfortunately, there is little to either the story line or the acting to understand the ridiculous comments regarding the quality of this movie. The antagonist is reminiscent of Caligula with over-acting and a twisted personality that defies understanding where his political strength came from. The protagonist is wooden and compares poorly to all the prior ""heroes"" of this genre. Russell Crowe manages to make Victor Mature look good which is quite an accomplishment.

When you start a movie by having the aging caesar far removed from the political center of Rome decide that he will confront his perverted son and announce that the son is getting the shaft and the general is getting the glory, credibility drops like a stone. No one but Maximus, the son and the daughter know of the plans for succession. Oh, surprise! son kills father. Son kills Maximus' family. Maximus spends the movies going through slavery, remote gladiator contests, Rome and final confrontation. If there was one clever plot element along the way, I missed it. Gladiator=glad it was over.",6
7 May 2000,All too predictable.,"Gladiator had it's moments, but was altogether too blunt and predictable. There was some superb acting, but the way the film was put together just comes off being very superficial. If a ten-year old boy was to make a movie, this would be their approach.

In a certain sense, the setting of the film was a time of rather simple people, so in that sense the movie could work. However, all these dream sequences are tacked on seemingly to try and give the movie some kind of deeper credibility. In that sense, the movie as a whole fails. Too bad for Phoenix, Crowe & Nielsen who turn in fine performances. Excellent makeup too!

1 May 2000,An incredible Roman gladiator epic...,"...and the best film of 2000 thus far. Ridley Scott brings us the story of Maximus, fallen General of Rome and unwilling slave and gladiator. He fights because he must and for vengeance on those who betrayed him. I am so glad Hollywood is giving us these epic tales this summer (can't wait for THE PATRIOT in June) instead of the usual FX bonanzas. Here, the FX are used to bring ancient Rome to life with astounding quality and scope, great job by Mill Film. The cast is great (most likely Crowe's star-making turn) with Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and Richard Harris. R.I.P. Oliver Reed, you were great in this one. An awe-inspiring score by Hans Zimmer with the help of Lisa Gerrard. If you know the score from THE INSIDER, you'll recognize her great work here. A great theme for the Battle of Germania early on. That in itself is a sight to behold. See this film and love it for it's grand scale, it's superior performances, it's action, bravado and intensity, and the sheer joy of seeing one of the best films you'll view this year. Hopefully, Oscar will recognize GLADIATOR's brilliance come next March. A hero has indeed risen. My grade: a 95 on The BiggieScale.",10
4 June 2001,"The best film of 2000, hands down.","A film of incredible vision, brought to life by the best talent in all fields of filmmaking. The wonderful performances, the masterful cinematography, the god-like directing by Ridley Scott, and the best score of Hans Zimmer's career make this picture one for the ages. It was robbed of quite a few Oscars (Director, Score, Cinematography, Editing, Sound FX), but hey that's the silly Academy for ya. This is my #6 favorite film of all-time and I gave it a 96 on my rating scale. Now if only they'd give Ridley's brother Tony Scott a chance at such an epic...

Strength + Honor! Roma Victor!

17 December 2000,Overblown mess of a film,"Another case of style trying to pass itself off as substance. If this is 'art', then why are the camera techniques so distracting? Why am I always aware that I am watching a movie. It might look like art, but it's just an arrogant attempt to fool the viewer. Too bad, there was a good story in there somewhere. Lost that in the whispered, muddled dialogue.

30 July 2000,The best so far,"Simply put, Gladiator is the best movie of the year so far. It doesn't bring back the Rome epic, it redefines it. CGI has allowed Ridley Scott to show Ancient Rome as it truly was. Gladiator also has more than just special effects. It has a riveting story of revenge, amazing acting performances, and great action. The action is not as plentiful as in Armageddon, but the scenes do come and they are amazing. Breathtaking cinematography, and an epic as well as solemn musical score help Ridley Scott's grand vision. I predict best actor nomination for Russel Crowe, as well as best supporting actor nomination for Joaquin Phoenix. Go see this movie. NOW!!!!!

5 May 2000,"Less historical than ""Asterix the Gaul""...","...But who cares!!! In my opinion this film is far better than the hyper-realistic Titanic, which seemed rather sterile. Here we have a fictitious scenario based on real characters.

Marcus Aurelius, philosopher-emperor, who is remembered as a _philosopher_ (something he was concerned about in the film!!).

Commodus, the insane megalomaniac, who in *real life* fought in the Colosseum against lions and also other gladiators, thought he was a reincarnation of Hercules, and tried to rename Rome ""Commodiana""! .... Maximus is not a real character, neither are the events depicted in the film. But it is a great story.

Highlights:

-Seeing a CGI Rome in all its glory was awe-inspiring!

-Battle against Germanic tribes: exciting *and* quite realistic!!

-Commodus, the insecure madman (not mad enough, though) was my favourite character. Nice white armour!

-The ""Middle Period"" of Roman history is so little-seen on the big screen - nice to see Hollywood get away from the usual Early Roman Empire/Caesar period.

-Proximo was also cool.

Bad points:

-As a student of history, I can't help but notice things were a *leetle* bit off reality. Saxon and Islamic helmets in a Roman amphitheatre??! Who is Maximus??? (But as I said, I don't mind).

-Combat was bloody and exciting, but Ridley's cinematics were a little choppy.

-Script was lame in parts. How about cool dialogue like Spartacus and I, Claudius?? Also, not enough swearing for *real* Romans...

But overall, a grand experience. For once a big budget film has good acting, good storyline, and the most realistic ancient battle seen on celluloid! Up the Marcomanni!!!

PS. An earlier reviewer claimed the Romans had no glass. Well, in short, they _did_. It's just that Hollywood doesn't normally depict it.",
5 June 2000,The digital special effects were a disappointment.,"I went to this movie to see Russell Crowe and the digital special effects. The digital special effects were a disappointment. The biggest being when Russell Crowe went into the Coliseum in Rome for the first time. I was not impressed by the panning around the Coliseum. A good deal of it looked artificial to me. I could plainly pick out the digital stuff. When they were building the Coliseum and there was a shot going over the under construction building it was obviously digitized. In the movie there was a shot from high up towards the ground of the Coliseum and you saw all these small people and they seemed Sim City like. Any scene that had a flock of birds was disturbingly not realistic and poorly digitally created. I am sure that they could have done a much better job. I liked Russell Crowe in this film and just mused to myself what it would have been like if Dr. Wigand could have gone into a telephone booth and come out Gladiatorman and slaughtered all the CEO's of the tobacco companies at the senate hearings. It would have been neat to see right arms flying and heads rolling. The fight scene at the beginning of the film was truncated and did not seem to be as effective as it could have been. Check out Braveheart. The fight scenes in this film are excellent but Russell Crowe does not look like what I envision a Roman to look like. I think of Kirk Douglas. Russell Crowe has the looks of a bloke in an Aussie pub. One of the best performances in the film was given by Oliver Reed. I really feel this is one of his very best. Richard Harris also does fine work as Marcus Aurelius. I did not even recognize David Hemmings of Blow-Up fame. He obviously doesn't have the Dorian Gray portrait thing going on. The Emperor is a puff and I could not help thinking of the Monty Python film The Life of Brian where the Emperor says ""What do they find so amooosing?"" I recommend seeing this film for the performances of Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris but do not expect to be bowled over by the digital special effects.",7
2 June 2000,boys' film / bad computer graphics - what a disappointment,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but it was so badly made!

The plot was minimal, the computer effects were very unconvincing, and some of the acting was sub-Eastenders standard (Joaquin ""my little busy bee"" Phoenix).

Saying that, Russell Crowe & the late Oliver Reed were both very good - shame they didn't have one of Shakespeare's Roman plays to get their teeth into - if you want violence with a good plot, try Titus Andronicus.

The cinematographic equivalent of a Chelsea match - just a boys film, and not a very good one at that.

18 August 2000,AWESOME!,"The only thing lacking in this movie is slow motion in the battle scenes. That would have made it truely amazing. The opening battle scene was the greatest. Russell Crowe, YOU THE MAN! And River Phoenix's brother was truely a weasel. I had to see it twice just to get my fix....""Billy, do you like gladiator movies?""....LOL...Not until this one.

11 May 2000,A very good movie,"I read some reviews, complaining that there wasn't enough ""skin"" in the movie - whoever they were they wanted beefcake. I can only imagine what would happen if someone had said that about a ""chick flick."" But any way - this is a very good movie, very worthwhile. It is almost 3 hours long but I was never bored once. But if you don't like men fighting with swords don't bother, because although that's not all the film was, there is a a lot of that involved (obviously - it's titled ""Galdiator"" after all).

14 May 2000,Superb sumptuous sweeping epic,"I think this might just be Ridley Scott's best yet.

The story is good, not great, but it's just so well told and in such bold charismatic tones, that you can't help but admire it. Lots of political intrigue, a fair sprinkling of human dignity, much savagery and of course Scott's familiar brooding cinematography.

Crowe has just got this swagger about him, that you would for kill for. All the actors are intoxicating to watch.

Yeah, sure, it's a little cheesy and drawn out in places, but still easily the best movie of the year.

Go see.

9 July 2012,"Brilliant, brilliant and brilliant. Did I say brilliant?","Gladiator deserves nothing else than a 10! It has amazing shots, sets, story, music, acting and screenplay overall. The story is also historically accurate.

From the moment I start watching and till the end of it I am amazed by it.

This is and will probably be my favorite movie ever made.

There is only one thing I would change. I would have removed the guy wearing jeans. Everything else is perfect.

This film is and will always be a piece of art.

Thats all I have to say, hope you all agree with me.

18 May 2000,Quality epic,"What a film. The epic is back with a bang. This is a must see film. On the whole the pace is fast, and holds your attention. There are a few areas that are slow, but these are soon forgotten. The acting is excellent, and the sets are wonderful.I will always remember Oliver Reed in this film, a true master.

28 May 2000,Russell Crowe is a true and classic hero right from the start,"The opening scene of the film is excellent and ties you to your seat and draws you directly into the movie. Russell Crowe does impress immediately with his performance as Maximus. He is truly heroic from the start.

The battle against the German barbarians is one of structure against chaos. You can see clearly why the Romans did win so many wars with their formations and attack patterns.

After the opening scene the story develops quite well. I know that there have been a lot of negative comments about the story but I disagree. Maximus is a simple man of 'strength and honor' from the start to the end and he fights for his vengeance. There is simply nothing more to it and the script contributes to that theme quite well.

Connie Nielsen as Lucilla (Christabella from the Devil's Advocate) plays her role very well. She plays a tough aristocratic lady not to fool around with; her relatives (Marcus Aurelius and Commodus) don't want her as an enemy! When the story develops the true nature of Lucilla reveals as mother and fighter for the right cause but trapped in the web of her brother. Nielsen (well educated, speaks 7 languages fluently) must have prepared herself quite good for the role. Oliver Reed is quite impressive as Proximo, the big boss of the gladiators. While filming Reed died in Malta from a heart attack. Joaquin Phoenix is fair enough as Commodus but not as impressive as the other main actors (including Richard Harris as the old and tired Marcus Aurelius, the old Ceasar).

The photography is astonishing and sometimes breathtaking. The creation of the old Rome is quite an achievement. It is amazing what they can do with computers these days. (I read that the scenes of Proximo in the second part where computer generated because of Oliver Reeds death) The few times repeated weat scene works well and gives a peacefull quiteness to the violence and blood shed.

It is an excellent movie and I'm sure that we will see more historic dramas in the near future.",9
5 May 2000,Ben Hur for the twothousandies Contains SPOILER,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",
14 May 2000,A horrible epic,"This is the worst movie I have seen this year and I saw ""Romeo Must Die"". Popcorn farers will consider this movie deep, moving, and informative. In reality, the acting is horribly melodramatic, more sentimental and overblown than anything I have seen in a while. I felt like I have seen every scene in this movie about a thousand times before: that's how filled with cinematic cliches the plot is. Only redeeming future are a couple of great fight scenes, especially the one with the juggernauts, which was the only time I found myself cheering for either of the sides. That marks another major fault of the movie: in the opening scene, it is impossible to tell who the characters are, and what side they are on, with exception of Maximus (who we simply know to be a Roman from the ads) and one big German guy too animalistic to be on Rome's side. There is some foreshadowing done with a dog, who one expects to play a major role in the battle or to functon prominently in the rest of the movie, it does neither. I am not even gonna mention the historical errors, but looking up Lucius Verus or the Gracchus brothers in the dictionary should be enough. That, and I still haven't figured out why Romans should speak with a British accent. Oscar voters should fall in love with this: it's an epic, it scores huge at the box office, all performances are overdone. If you ever liked a Fellini or a Kubrick film, stay away. 2 out of 10.",2
17 June 2000,"Solid, but nothing special","Walking into this movie, I was extremely hyped. Walking out of this movie, I was reading the list of ingredients on the back of the Malteser packet. Enough said.

Gladiator is certainly worth seeing - the visuals are impressive, the action is fast-paced, and Russell Crowe is gruff and heroic. But that's about all. The script is so-so; the plot is basic and predictable; and, most disappointing of all, you really don't get sucked in emotionally. I mean, all a film like this aims to do is:

(a) present a two-dimensional hero;

(b) do some nasty things to his relatives; and

(c) get you squirming in your seat waiting for the bad guys to get what's coming to them.

It was like this in Mad Max ('Road Warrior' for you Americans out there), in was like this in Braveheart, it was like this in Rob Roy, and it was like this in virtually action/drama ever made. For the film to succeed, an audience should be 'angry' when the relatives get fried, and 'pumped' when the good guy gets revenge. I was pretty non-plussed on both counts.

As for specifics:

Russell Crowe is good but not fantastic (and nowhere near as good as his performance in LA Confidential)

Oliver Reed's character is overdone and annoying (the only thing he adds to the film is the 'pick which scenes Olly is dead in' game - as he died before filming finished and is computer generated in some parts).

The CGI effects are, as always, dreadful. Although the stadium itself looks ok from the inside, the wider shots of Rome look fake. Why they PERSIST with these crappy effects I don't know.",8
4 June 2000,Best of 2000,"Far and away the best movie I've seen since ""Saving Private Ryan"" nearly two years ago. I've seen it twice at the theater, and have every intention of seeing it again before the summer ends. I'm fervently hoping that Hollywood realizes how successful ""historical fiction"" can be. ""Braveheart"" is another excellent example. Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as the stoic Roman General Maximus. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Gladiator features plenty of action, but unlike so many ""swordplay"" movies, the action does not seem overly unrealistic. What really seperates Gladiator from so many other similar movies is the fact that one never loses interest in the plot as the action unfolds. There are no tiresome ""downtime"" sequences, nor does one get a sense that the ending of the movie was rushed in any way. The movie flows from start to finish, and is a great ride for the entire 3 hours.

I'm really hoping to see Crowe cast in similar roles...the hero in a serious/realistic movie. I'll definitely take note of any movie in which he appears from now on.",10
17 December 2005,Great Movie,"I find this movie great from all sides i mean actors music and every thing. It can be the best movie talking about this certain period of time. Also being able to convince people of every action the hero makes is great. The movie had great sound effects that added more greatness to the movie. The hero was general maximus acted by russell crowe who made the best role in his career in this movie. The movie shows corruption and hatred that is being found in human beings in all times and vengeance that fills the hearts. The greatest parts in the movie is the parts when the gladiators fight for their live(kill or die). The fights where pictured perfectly . Also what made me like that movie was the story as talks about a man who was a general and then became a slave the a gladiator and then he challenges Cesar to a fight for death that is amusing and special.

28 May 2000,kind of like an imax film,"Good graphics, good gore special effects, awesome decapitations. About an hour and a half of useless boring talking head crap that should've been cut or infused with decent writing. Semi-interesting but ultimately flat story. Reminded me of ""Payback"" (Mel Gibson takes on the mob) minus the humour. This guy was UNSTOPPABLE.. I mean, why didn't he just take on the whole Roman army himself? Totally unbelievable.

The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes are stylistic masterpieces. I have been to Rome however, I have seen the Coliseum, and I don't think it would ever look quite so ""gold"". Actually, everything looks ""gold"" in this film, giving the film a somewhat tacky commercial sheen. I wish he'd done something a little more rough around the edges like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan. The one dimensional story never approaches the emotional impact of Kubrick's ""I am Spartacus"" climax either.

Still, I must admit that this would make for a very nice Imax experience. The set design is impeccable and the background detail is meticulous. If you ever fantasized about visiting ancient Rome, this is as good as it gets.",7
2 April 2001,No I am not entertained.,"No I am not entertained. I went to this movie expecting little and receiving less. I could single out certain individuals to point the finger at for this artistic failure of a film, but can't seem to see the point in it, this film was bad in so many areas that it really is a collaborative debacle. Even the general audience failed, because in accepting this film the standards for what will be honored as a great film have been lowered dramatically. The dialogue was stupid, the characters were completely overdrawn, the performances were typical, the plot was as formulaic as it gets, not one moment in this film left me anticipating the next, not one character was original or intriguing, and the cinematography was unimaginative and monotonous. On top of this they kill off Richard Harris the best actor in the film at the beginning of this movie which crawls on its belly to the end. To its credit the film does a decent job of creating the coliseum which unfortunately is not as impressive given the fact that Spartacus the original gladiator film was done four decades before this release and was just as successful if not more in this aspect. This film never comes close to achieving the success of similar films made long ago. At best Gladiator is a watered down flat derivative of Spartacus. The film is as dead as the time period it was supposed to depict, and perhaps just as dead is the general public's knowledge of a good film. As a side note when one asks why it is important to have an appreciation and understanding of history in regards to art or a lexicon in the language of film I can think of no better reason than 'without a perspective of a variety of great works one will never fully be able to appreciate or understand what a great work truly is.' In short this film lacked everything that constitutes a great film. What is that? Great filmmaking.",4

13 February 2001,"Like a cheap chocolate Easter Bunny: pretty package, but hollow","There is a scene in Gladiator where Maximus is eating with a couple other gladiators. One is Juba, the man he befriends almost immediately after getting captured; and the other is the really big man (I'll call him Big Guy), I am not sure of the name, who Maximus refused to fight earlier, while the gladiators were, I presume, getting evaluated on their skills. In the scene Big Guy asks Maximus about his days as being a general. He asks if he fought in Germania, and Maximus responds, and I apologize for not having the exact quote, ""I've fought in lots of countries."" Something to that effect. When the question was asked, I thought to myself how interesting it would be if Big Guy had lost family in Germania. When you think about it it was a terribly odd question for Big Guy to ask. It became a distraction. I kept waiting for the great climax of the film, when Rome is safe and secure with Maximus finally being able to retire, when along comes Big Guy to do what none of the Romans could do: kill Maximus. And why not, I figured. After all, there were families killed in Germania too, right. Unfortunately nothing came of it, and I don't think I am giving anything away when I say that Big Guy eventually gets shot with arrows (despite the obviously apparent safety vest underneath his tunic). O.k. So I am giving something away, but he is a very minor character, as it turned out.

I only mention this delusion of mine because I think it says something about how hollow the script was, and what could have been. I mean, we had already been given a possible subplot during the ""evaluation scene"" when the two men give each other very serious looks, to put it mildly. I thought that this subplot would have given the film what it dearly lacked: something worth saying--perhaps a comment on violence in our society, how the brutality of war effects people on both sides of the battlefield. Frankly I would have liked to have had it happen. It would have made the experience much more enjoyable. Of course, the F/X still would have looked kind of cheesey, and the battle scenes would have been confusing and, quite frankly, poorly executed; but what a turn it would have made. Only a handful of people (possibly those who had long since gone bonkers) would have seen it coming. Instead of this we get nothing really. Just an especially brutal film that has nothing serious to say about anything.",5
8 June 2001,An excellent Action film with substance,"Gladiator was an excellent example of what action films can be, when the writer and director truly care about the total presentation. The film is mostly accurate with it's portrayal of the time period, and the writing gives the viewer a sense of connection with these men. The violence was shown in a manner that did not detract from the story. Before I saw the film I had trepidations due to the subject matter, but all the graphic shots were quick and to the point, showing the nature of the combat, but not ""gore for gore's sake"".

Overall, one of the finest films I have seen.

I liked this movie so much, I went out and got the special edition DVD. But there is something I must say. Joaquin Phoenix was the best by far! He's the one who should've

played Maximus! But he was cool as the villain anyway. I will always consider this Joaquin's best role! Anyhow, it was an overall good movie, kind of gross, but who gives a damn! This is a 10/10 for me. See it if you love action/Dramatic movies that keep you happy until the end.

17 December 2004,Bonus points for sword fights,"I love action movies, in particular movies that contain warfare. Modern warfare is okay, but I like to old school fighting.Swords will always win points with me. Dismemberment and decapitations will also win points. The movie has a great screenplay, good acting, good environments and the first battle scene was great! The chariot scene is pretty cool.It also has the ending that I felt was right. I was actually hoping it was going to happen, and when you think of it, does that make sense? It does for this movie. One of my all time favorite movies, I could watch this movie any night. I might watch it later this week now that I'm thinking of it.

21 May 2000,"A woman's picture, I guess","I was extremely disappointed. The trailer looked great, but the movie was so boring and trite I asked my wife if she wanted to leave 1/2 way through. Apparently, she was having a great time and loved the movie. I thought the plot revolved around punishing patricide, but my wife thought it a sweet story of frustrated love.

For some reason, we saw entirely different movies.

Getting back to the trailer, I hope someday there is a movie that matches the trailer's promise. I was willing to put up with a cardboard plot if the action and computer graphics were spectacular. They were not. The scale was all wrong... not realistic but cartoonish. In many scenes the action had a curious jerkyness, as if there was not enough money to create 30 computer frames per second so 15 had been used. I had hoped for an experience of 'being in Rome during a gladiator fight' but it failed to deliver.

3 February 2014,I think you've been afraid all your life.,"Although this film has many great actors it was Crowe and Connie Nielsen who give it heart. Crowe's presence fills the auditorium and convinces the audience important events are taking place. Crowe pulls you to his side and you root for him almost from the start of the film.

This work is his finest from his appearance as the fierce but reluctant general who was a farmer at heart to his work as the brilliant, unstoppable gladiator warrior to the final scenes when he finally faces the man he has cursed and vowed to kill.

He defies an emperor.

The Emperor is a yellow-livered, depraved poor excuse for a human being but he is no pushover. He is a determined worm of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ruthless in attaining his goals, always wrong-headed but unrelenting in his pursuit of satisfying his twisted desires.

The movie culminates in a life and death contest between the Crowe and the emperor and at times the outcome seems in doubt.

The film was lush and stunning representation of Imperial Rome and the action, both on the battlefield and in the Colosseum, is both beautiful and compelling.

This movie contains almost no historical truths but this quickly becomes a matter of who cares? ""Gladiator"" is story telling at its best and whether the naysayers, and there are many, like it or not, ""Gladiator"" is destined be a classic.

Connie Nielsen brings a strong and pure feminine energy to the film and her final scene, while is almost melodramatic, will remain firmly established in my mind as one of my favorite movie memories.

Could anyone have played the emperor better than Joaquin Phoenix? Possibly but could anyone else have given us greater insight into the twisted soul of the emperor? Could anyone else have allowed us to actually feel compassion for the tortured psyche of the emperor? I don't know but Phoenix did all that and gave us a portrayal of the complex and human side of a bad man.",10
16 July 2000,Too Long!,"We're not big fans of this genre but we enjoyed the special effects of the war scenes. I remember Spartacus as being better written and acted. But my wife's and my biggest criticism is that Gladiator is just too long. When Gladiator ended, we and others we overheard in the audience were really happy to get up and leave. We went to see Gladiator because it was so highly rated (8.4!) by the participants in this great website (IMDb) and because we wanted to see Meg Ryan's new love, Russell Crowe, in the starring role for which he has won praise for his acting. Because of the length of the movie, we came away wanting less. Save it for a rainy day and video when you have a lot of time to kill. (But you better have a big t.v. screen so you can appreciate the action). We rated Gladiator as a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.

14 February 2016,Some numbers just for fun,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9

14 May 2019,Good Watch,"18 year old movie and still elicits a range of emotions from excitement, anger, relief, hatred, and many others. This film stands the test of time and is still a great work of art. Costumes are on point, music that is epic and intimate, videography that takes you to battle and pulls out to show the scale of the greatest city before our time. While not historically accurate, its a great story that was told masterfully.

14 May 2000,"A hero, denied his rightful reward, is cast out of society, and makes his way back to his rightful place.","The Roman Empire is back, in all its glory and filth. The plot is simple and mythic: A hero is denied his rightful reward, is cast out of society, and makes his way back to his rightful place. Russell Crowe's Maximum oozes honor and dignity, even when all he knows is destroyed around him. Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is his antithesis -- an insecure, scared, and malevolent ruler. You know good will triumph in the end (it always does in such blockbuster films), but the hows and wherefores are worth watching nonetheless. Ridley Scott has created a visual masterpiece in his recreation of ancient Rome (the cityscapes reminded me, oddly, of Naboo in the Phantom Menace; surely my imagination was running overtime?). Depicting the Roman circus in all its gore (although most of the truly awful stuff is just off camera, leaving too much to the imagination), this movie deserves its R rating. But I enjoyed it, overall.

4 June 2000,"Interesting Story, but Historically Inaccurate","This was an interesting story, but historically was a little bit mixed up. It combines figures from different points in Roman History. The real General Maximus was declared emperor after conquering Britain, by his troops and some locals. He then went to Germany entered an alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Empire. He then attacked the Western empire and emperor Gratian and Gratian was killed in battle. Maximus ruled some of the northern and western provinces for a few years and then decided to invade Italy and took over the whole Western Empire for a year or so, then got into a war with the Eastern empire, and lost, and was executed. Marcus Aurelius was an interesting emperor, but he lived 200 years earlier. His chief general in Germany was Avidius Cassius, who usurped him a couple of years before he died, and the conflict forced him to appoint Commodus as joint emperor several years before he died. Commodus went insane, (possibly due to lead poisoning), and was eventually strangled by a gladiator as part of an assassination plot by his sister and his own cabinet. Enjoy the movie, but try to keep it in historical perspective.",6
21 May 2000,"Good, but not great","I thought that there were many good things about this film, but the story played like an episode of All My Children, and plot holes leaked the rain from outside into the theater (if he could escape being executed by the soldiers ... why couldn't he escape being forced to be a Gladiator?). I think Russell Crowe did a good job, but nothing about the Maximum role required him to act that hard. The best moment for him in the film was when Lucious approached him in the Gladiator holding cage ... very genuine acting. This film need more humour and tender moments. The biggest problem I had was believing the ending.

7 May 2000,Can't Stop Thinking About It,"For me, there was mostly nothing unlikeable about this movie. The fighting sequences were great. I do not doubt that battle at that time was just as it was depicted. Admittedly, I was into it although I would not applaud as many of my fellow moviegoers did over every death. The story was a really good one, too. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I thought it was a little ridiculous that Commodus would take Maximus on. But, for where the story had gone up to that point, if I were the writer I could not have seen any other way for the story to end, either. Gladiator, also strengthened one point in my mind. I couldn't help but feel a little sympathy for Commodus, whose father would have taken anyone for a son, but his own. He probably hadn't seen his father much in those 20 years he was off fighting barbarians and all. Not that it's an excuse for his behavior, but it's kind of tragic because that is easily how a lot of people lose their way in the world. Having been denied love and approval from parents and peers, they're easy prey for negative influences, people who shape their unloved, weakened spirits into evil and hatred. Or, in this case, their own idle minds think up evil things. It's really sad. I saw this movie twice this weekend and this idea stayed with me the last time. Movies are only partly make-believe. There's still some truth to each one, some humanity that we all recognize. Anyhow, back to that last fight scene...though I realize this is a movie, I can't believe Commodus went out like that. After the first few times, he should have realized Maximus was not affected by his weak punches. See, he was used to those chroeographed fights he had with his Praetorian buddies in the woods and didn't know how to improvise when caught without his sword. With life at stake you'd think he would've bit the guy's nose or kicked him in the nuts or somethin'. Oh well. I really like this movie on the whole. Each of the performances was great ! I for one, was paying too much attention to the action that I could care less whether or not I could see every person in the upper tier of the audience. Though I usually don't compare movies, I did think the opening music sounded a bit ""Last of the Mohicans."" [And it's bothering me that I can't figure out where I've seen Max's son before.] And, I've already told my Mom that we're seeing this again this weekend. If I didn't have to work, I'd see it tomorrow! Dammit, I'll be thinking about it all week long. :(",10
3 May 2000,The perfect example of why we go to the movies.,"I'm hoping people will discover it for themselves, so I'm not giving anything anyway. Suffice to say that nobody will EVER be able to say ""They don't make them like they used to"" anymore. Commanding performances, jaw-dropping visuals and shockingly exciting action sequences are only a few of the excellent components of Gladiator. I envy all of you who have yet to see it.

24 May 2000,An excellent spectacle and historical film.,"I don't know where all this sarcasm about recent films is coming from(perhaps too many previews), but in this film it is completely undeserved. Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix as his archenemy delivers a splendid if not disturbing (after his innocence in ""Inventing the Abbotts"") performance as well. The story may be old, but is not known to all. How true the film is to the true story I cannot say, but the performances and the excellent cast alone is worth seeing it for. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are excellent as well as their young counterparts. But be warned~ I did not expect the violence and gore that was displayed in the battles. However, this film will move you and the ending is very touching. I talked two friends into seeing it with my husband and I, and they thoroughly enjoyed it.

Enjoy, Carmen :0)

22 May 2000,Ridley Scott finally delivers the goods again,"I saw ""Gladiator"" three weeks ago, but only now I've got the opportunity to write a comment: the opening battle sequence alone is absolutely impressive and perfectly sets the tone for Maximus' story. Russell Crowe was good but with his powerful Jeffrey Wigand (from Michael Manns modern classic ""The Insider"") still in mind, he didn't impress me as much this time around. Yet, I can't think of another actors to be more suitable for such roles as Russell Crowe and it's clearly to his credit that ""Gladiator"" is such a fine movie. Joaquoin Phoenix is much less convincing, I actually found him pathetic. But that is as well one of the few minor weak points in an otherwise decent script: they should have come up with a tougher, more dangerous emperor - Commodus never convinced me as a serious nemesis for Maximus. Richard Harris, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (if much of his appearance in the movie had to be computergenerated due to his death during the shoot, then I must say, the result is baffling - it's never obvious, though you might guess where they used CGI) and particularly Derek Jacobi as the senator who strives to dethrone Commodus were so good in their roles that they easily compensated for the shortcomings in the characterization. Visually, ""Gladiator"" is ravishing to look at and the battle sequences are some of the best I've ever seen (dull remake of Braveheart? Bah! Braveheart is self-indulgent and plain idiotic - eat your heart out, Mel Gibson).

Admittedly, there were some images in the movie similar to those in Leni Riefenstahls NS propaganda movie ""Triumph of the Will"" but so what? There is no fascist ideology (neither obvious nor hidden) in Ridley Scotts film to worry about. If Scott borrowed images from Riefenstahls propaganda piece then in the intention to establish the sense of epic proportions, to show the power and glory of the Roman Empire, nothing else. ""Gladiator"" has been compared to ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" - time will tell if it once will be hailed as a classic. I personally like it more than ""Spartacus"" (from which maestro Kubrick distanced himself), but it comes nowhere close to Wylers ""Ben Hur"". But it must be said that it is Ridley Scotts best movie for a long time (though, by no means as good as Alien and Blade Runner), exciting and breathtaking. Bring up ""Hannibal""(8,5 out of 10)",8
2 January 2001,Great Film,"`Gladiator' (2000)

*** ¬Ω Out of ****

A great film about a man who is forced to kill to get to his family. Russell Crowe plays a man who is supposed to be king but the son of the last king ends up getting the crown by force. Then Russell has to fight as a gladiator to stay alive. He ends up being very good at it and becomes the crowd's favorite. He continues to fight on his way back to his family

Russell Crowe does an excellent job playing his role and the special effects in this movie are extreme. The story never shifts directions and the plot is one of a kind. The only reason this film did not get 4 stars is because of the other characters. It is uncertain to the viewer whether they are supposed to like or dislike some of them and that is confusing. It also brought the story down because you cannot decide whether the character is good or bad and you don't know who to support. There is no question to support Russell but every one else is in a gray area. I would recommend this movie to anyone but if you are the slightest bit squeamish don't go see Gladiator because although great it is a very extreme movie.",
7 May 2000,The first blockbuster of the year,"Gladiator is in the top 3 best ""Roman"" movies I have seen--and I have seen them all--along with Ben Hur and Spartacus. Many people talk about the opening battle in Germania, but to me the highlight was the Carthage gladiator battle in the middle. Russell Crowe is going to be hotter than those flaming balls of oil. The production values were superb, and I just cannot conceive of any film coming up this year beating Gladiator in all the technical aspects--Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, Score (I HAVE to get that CD!!), Film Editing, Visual Effects, and Sound. Anyone who doesn't see it in the theatre is nuts (and I have a vested interest in hoping this does well so we get some more blood and sand epics like this one!). Long live Gladiator!

13 January 2001,The best movie of 2000!,"I was lucky enough to see Gladiator on the big screen, and I'm glad I did because it was an experience to remember. I believe this is one of the most brilliantly made films I have ever seen, and I could not point out a single flaw. The cast was exceptional, not least Russell Crowe, moody and magnificent in the title role. Joaquin Phoenix was also utterly believable as the twisted Commodus. I had never heard of Connie Nielsen before, but found she gave a very convincing performance as Lucilla. British fans will not be disappointed either, for an excellent support headed by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi adds even more strength and depth.

The story itself is powerful enough, helped along by some truly awesome special effects. The view of the Colosseum is so real and yet purely digital, the battle scenes are sometimes gruesome but always breathtaking. Finally, a masterful score by Hans Zimmer gives this film its heart-wrenching edge and brings out every emotion in the brutal tale.

Anyone who thought this an over-hyped blockbuster in the way of 'Titanic' is utterly mistaken. It is a masterpiece and historical epic that brings back the true meaning of cinema. I only hope that the Oscars can do it justice, if for once they get it right.",10
24 March 2001,Only a flesh wound,"Gladiator isn't a great film by any means, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviews would suggest. Sure, it depends mainly on big budget spectacle and production design to achieve its effect, but it's surprising how far big budget spectacle can take you.

I disagree with those who say that Russell Crowe was more or less interchangeable with any other Hollywood action star in the main role. I thought his basic persona - the strong yet vulnerable man carrying deep hurts - was quite well used in this film, and his performance and Connie Nielsen's lent a semblance of human interest to a script that didn't give them much to work with. The film's ability to build human drama isn't helped by its failure to provide a credible villain: it's obvious from the beginning that Commodus is no more going to be a match for Maximus than Frank Burns was for Hawkeye and B.J.

Some people have also criticized the film for its gratuitous violence, but I'm not sure if I go along with that either. If you are going to make a gladiator movie, you might as well go for broke. As a number of commentators have pointed out, we go to gladiator movies for pretty much the same reason as the Romans went to the Colosseum. To see blood.

Having said all that, I don't think the film was particularly well made. The film seems if anything to get less spectacular as it goes along, and what should be a series of climactic sequences at the end come across as hurried and confused. There are also rather too many places where the film is unintentionally comic. There's the film's odd notion that the Roman ruling classes all spoke in upper-class British accents. Then there are what look like odd borrowings from, or maybe misplaced tributes to, other films: the American Beauty-style falling petals, or the slow-motion battle sequences, which looked elegiacal in Kurosawa but seem Pythonesque here. Actually, even Maximus' name struck me as Pythonesque - I kept wondering whether his first name was Naughtius, and whether he had a friend called Biggus. Perhaps Naughtius Maximus would be an apt nickname for Russell Crowe in real life.

Once or twice the film does hint at higher ambitions. It touches on the theme of Commodus', Gracchus' and Maximus' relationships with the public, and the potential was there for the film to be a very original type of political thriller - something that would have given point to all those crowd scenes and all those power plays. But that theme isn't developed. In the end, Gladiator is not that kind of film.",6
16 March 2001,Epic of the Year!!!,"Epics have come a long way since the 1950s. Gladiator is a gem of a movie. Outstanding from first frame to last, this is moviemaking at its best. The opening battle scenes which were filmed in Surrey I believe, have to be seen to be believed. Russell Crow is perfectly cast as the Roman General who is betrayed, loses his wife and son who are both murdered, and then ends up in the Arena seeking revenge against Emporer Commodus. Some of the action is brilliant to watch. It is also a fine tribute to Oliver Reed who sadly died during the final shooting. Won't beat Ben-Hur for oscars though, but should gain a few.

13 June 2020,Gladiator,"Sometimes the story of a slave changing into a general, although there are many films of the same type, looks very shocking. But the same is true in history. If there is oppression, there will be resistance. The resistance crowd will always have a leader, and each person who acts as a leader has his own unique place.

7 December 2006,"In Gladiator, the main character Maximus is a former general for the Roman army and is a friend of Caesar.","I think this movie was really great because the story line was really emotional and believable. The locations for the filming were impeccable. The acting and actors were astounding. This movie had it all drama, action, romance, comedy. A must see movie. This is the kind of movie that anyone (except young children) could enjoy. With all the fighting and gore, it would attract the males. With the love and romance and all the things Maximus does for love and family it would attract the females. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it is just so awesome. I highly recommend anyone go see this one of a kind movie.

6 September 2010,"Not bad story, some solid acting, crafted with extremely well choreographed martial-arts action sequences","Back when this movie was born, I didn't get the chance to watch it. I'm glad I did today, of course, the 10th anniversary remastered version.

In general, it's a typical action-oriented Hollywood blockbuster, where there's not much plot involved. But this film successfully keeps its pace at a mid rate that doesn't make audience fall asleep, which is good for its genre. Compared to action thrillers like Bourne films, it lacks twists, while compared to formulaic ones like Kill Bill and 300, it still offers you a lot to see; not to mention that it's got a good ending.

As for the acting, not THAT much can be pointed out as outstanding since for a historical epic like this, it's mainly about men's bravery and the like. But, Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus is beyond awesome! He really brought the character into life as well as some depth. And of course, he's looking handsome as always (said by me, a boy who's not gay :D, LOL). Other characters do well enough to keep the film go on, but perhaps it's due to the simplicity of the parts for them that they do just good but not great on the whole.

On the other hand, directing, coloring (post-production), score and staging are all very well done. The colorful cinematography reaches state of art. Everything, ranging from constructions, sceneries, costumes to decorations of rooms, is beautifully colorful. Action sequences are where the film truly stands out. Apart from being well choreographed, there're also many little innovations to them that are very original.

The major flaw is certain useless subplots that slow the already-not- fast pace down, especially in the 1st act. But that doesn't hurt much, as the later scenes' intensity makes up for it.

5 November 2020,A lot of Sus-pince and drama,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",7

11 May 2000,Too long,"This 2.5 hour film was, easily, half-an-hour too long. There are several spots where boredom sets in during oh-so-excessively-too-long scenes. Yet, Ridley Scott opted to use rapid jump cuts during the battle scenes, leaving me almost dizzy, and not totally certain of what I had just seen.

At 2 hours, this would be a much better film. As is, I gave it a ""fair"" ""6"".

10 July 2000,"Give me 3 hours of Russell Crowe in a skirt, I'm a happy camper!","I was ready to loathe this movie and I found myself enjoying it immensely. It has craters in the story the size of the Colisseum, but Russell Crowe makes it all work. He is totally believable as a hero, as a gladiator, as anything. He is a rare combination of star power and awesome acting skills, and he grounds and dignifies this movie even when it gets manipulative, cheesy and vulgar. Also, the writing was surprisingly mature. I loved the way the Colisseum looked, I loved seeing Oliver Reed again, and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic too. The music sucked big time. If Gustav Holst was alive he would sue the composers for stealing unashamedly from his symphonic poem, ""The Planets"". Gladiator is the best film Ridley Scott has done in a looooong time, but that doesn't mean much, does it?

It is well worth seeing. Hugely entertaining and not too dumb.

25 September 2000,Is this an authentic Scott at all???,"Even if ¬´Gladiator¬ª weren't as weak and banal as it is on it's own right, the fact that it was supposedly done by the very same man who created ¬´Blade Runner¬ª and ¬´Alien¬ª would be enough to damn it in all eternity.

What an unbelievable loss of filmic quality! What a shamefully predictable plot! What quaint dialogues! What - even that! - poor videogamey visuals! All right: there's patricide, there's revenge, there's lotsa blood. There's even almost incest. But all oh so underscored and looked at in such awe and abomination that it can only be there to cater for a bourgeois (or adolescent, for that matter) need of a thrill, quickly followed by the reestablishment of order. Nothing more. No discussion, no actual leap into the dark. Nothing really unsettling, for the gods will eventually see to it.

Not worth one of Sigourney Weaver's gasps or of Harrison Ford's broken nails.

Whatever's the matter with Ridley Scott?? ¬´Alien¬ª shaped all our nightmares afterwards and the future was never the same after ¬´Blade runner¬ª. And then, ¬´Gladiator¬ª... There's this very popular phenomenon of director's senility (just take a look at Coppola's ¬´Jack¬ª or Antonioni's ¬´Jenseits der Wolken¬ª for the sake of illustration). But then, R.S. isn't THAT old yet, is he...? Can't really fathom it.

Due to a very strange paradox, I doubt ¬´Glads¬ª would ever attract as much attention as it did, were it not done by the great author of ¬´Alien¬ª and ¬´Blade Runner¬ª. Whoever would have enjoyed it anyway would enjoy it and forget it. More reasonable people wouldn't be seen dead in the theatre, not even gagged and handcuffed. For one thing, -I- would definitely not be wasting my time writing about it. But, again, justice must take its course.",1
5 January 2001,Escapist fun,"This is the Robin Hood TV series of the year 2000. Not a gentle movie, but full of good goodies and bad baddies and a bloody good time at the movies when you don't want to be intellectually challenged. Great good fun. Highly recommended for anyone over mid-teens. Absolutely verboten for the very young or sensitive.

7 May 2000,Not quite there,"The show was good but not great. It would, hopefully, revive the sword and sandal genre on a more epic scale. There were a few ""big"" moments like the opening battle scene but everything just peters out towards the ending. Even the gladiator fight scenes, though well cheoreographed, were not exactly epic in scale. The only other visual feast was when Comedius returned to Rome as the succeeding emperor but that was in the first third of the film!

Russell Crowe does a fine job but the most interesting role belongs to Connie Nielsen. She seemed morally ambiguous and her claims of fearing her brother and being coerced into certain actions were only half-believable. She could be more opportunistic and manipulative than cowered and a victim of circumstance. This role could be explored deeper but I'm glad there was such a character to cast some doubt and shadow in an otherwise black or white morality storyline.

Watch the show for it is a fine piece of work but NOT one of the best film that one will ever see.",7
18 May 2000,"This is a ""must see"" for everyone except young children","I wasn't expecting more out of Gladiator than a few good fight scenes. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. This movie was fantastic! In fact, quit reading this review and just go see it, right now.

Well, if you need a little convincing¬Ö

Gladiator is the story of the Roman General, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who was charged by dieing emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) with returning the government of Rome to the people. However, before the emperor can announce his wishes publicly, he is betrayed by his son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). General Maximus becomes hunted and eventually thrown into slavery where he finds himself fighting for survival in the Roman stadiums of Africa.

I can think of nothing to criticize about this film, so I'll borrow a criticism from a friend who thought the movie was too long and was monotonous in some parts (I disagreed).

The battles were quite graphic at times, but trust me, you will enjoy this movie.",
15 July 2000,Good Movie; Computer Graphics Overdone,"Having read in a Los Angeles major newspaper critique that this was the BEST movie of the year, I witnessed this movie expecting a 4 star performance. However I was somewhat disappointed by the extreme use of computer graphics. I deliberately haven't read any comments from other viewers or any other reviews so I could write unfettered. The emperor, the son of Marcus Aurelius, was the best actor along with his father. The fight scenes were excellent but they were mostly camera motion and sound effects. How one man could survive hand to hand combat with a never ending no. of physically fit combatants was hard for me to believe. And lastly, I missed out on hearing a large number of words. My wife seconds the motion on that one as well. All in all a relatively fast-paced entertaining movie but it did not come close to The Patriot which I thoroughly enjoyed.

3 November 2000,A film so good it hurts,"Most films are 'quite good'. That, as a critical comment, is applied to the kinds of films that are well-made, thoughtful, etc. Gladiator is not 'quite good'. It is beyond goodness. Watching it, on the first weekend it came out, in a packed cinema and the volume turned up to the max, it actually felt like the Christmas you've always wanted as a child.

Russell Crowe is 50% of the reason the film is so great, as he actually makes you believe in, and care about, the character. The other reason it's so good is Ridley Scott; this is easily his best film, by a mile and a half. Buy the soundtrack, DVD, poster...it's the best film of the year, and the best film I've seen since Face/Off (1997).

What begins in life, echoes in eternity.

15 July 2001,"Good, if you like Roman history","2 remarks:

1. This is the first time I saw such a great scene about a Roman battle against Germans. You can see the Roman war methods in action.

2. I found the buildings at Forum Romanum a bit different from what you can see there as tourist. The real Senat seemed to me (a) much smaller than in movie (b) and the real entry into Senat did not lead towards the Coloseum, as it is in the movie.

27 September 2006,One of the greatest movies of it's kind. Rent it.,"I think Gladiator 2000 was one the finest movies of it's kind. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar and I think that Phoenix should have received the best supporting actor Oscar. The battles, the intensity, the overall rawness of this movie is right up there with Ben Hur, Sparticus or any other movie of it's kind. When ever I want to sit down and watch a great movie I'll watch Gladiator. Cinematography is excellent. I can't actually find any fault with this movie. Phoenix was so great and so genuine as an evil ruler you want to go through the screen and choke him to death. All the fight scenes with gladiators against gladiators, and gladiators against with the tiger was outstanding. The friendship of the gladiators waiting for there turn to live or die in the arena's was also a big part of this movie.

22 May 2000,Spectacular!,"Spectacular is both a genre description and my personal opinion. I won't repeat raves about Russell Crowe or attempt to show my knowledge of Roman history by pointing out the inaccuracies. I'm sure Tacitus would be forgiving. I will simply say that the movie was vastly entertaining and left me slack jawed with it's depictions of ancient Rome. I am SO impressed with the state of computer graphics. The costuming was VERY accurate (not an ""attic"" helmet in sight). The combat scenes were convincing and engrossing and bloody. Also having seen ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" it was interesting to compare the filmmakers' ideas and conceptions of the characters. What's more, my WIFE liked it, and cried at the end. How about THAT! ""Gladiator"" will definitely go on my list of favorite movies.

15 May 2000,Disappoint Much? Contans Spoilers,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",1
2 July 2000,almost the top of its genre,"The battle scene in Gladiator presents the dichotomy of the human butchery below and the serenity of the sky above. That image becomes the theme of the film itself. Like all worthy films, Gladiator is a love story. Love being a complex emotion with two faces, it is the character of the cruel and cowardly emperor Commodus that truly stitches this movie together. As Commodus, I found that Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance comparable (if not exceeding) that of no greater a portrayer of cinematic villainy than Christopher Plummer. Plummer, the most noted Iago, Shakespeare's ultimate bad guy, of the 20th Century, also assayed the part of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964). In that, lesser, film Plummer's Commodus provides the common foe that enables the love connection between Sophia Loren and Steven Boyd to shine. In Gladiator, Phoenix's brooding depiction of a man balanced on the edge of insanity lends his victim the pedestal of greatness, and in turn propels Gladiator above other Ancient Roman era epics, with the exception of Ben-Hur. It is love that sends Commodus over the edge, not love of a woman, but love of himself, when he finds that he can't truly kill his father, the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose spirit carries on in the person of the betrayed general and eventual gladiator Maximus (Russell Crowe). The battle scene and the scenes of gladiatorial combat are not cheap gore. They underscore the inherent brutality of that place and that time in history. There is blood, but just enough to make the point intended. Another theme in Ancient Roman costume epics has been the birth and fruition of Christianity, most notably in Ben-Hur and The Robe. This is touched into the canvas of Gladiator with a fine brush, as if Seurat had painted the scene, but it never comes forefront, almost thankfully. Like the sky above the battle scene, it is simply there, in the love of Maximus for his absent wife and son. There are some noted actors who contribute to Gladiator: Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius; the late Oliver Reed; and Derek Jacobi (who has had plenty of experience in a toga as the star of the I, Claudius series). Gladiator is a worthwhile and uplifting film, well-acted and well-directed. It does not succeed to the top of its genre, but very nearly so.",8
27 June 2022,Amazing Movie,"Gladiator, it's an incredible movie, I really love the plot, excellent action scenes, there are several moments that I consider very sentimental and that the music of those moments makes me relax, I identify more with the main character, Maximus, like other characters, that I love so much, from amazing movies or franchises.

25 November 2000,a movie you have to see at least once in your life,"The first time i heard about the Gladiator, I thought it would be all action and no story. Although the story wasn't that complicated, it was really compelling to watch. There are some political issues discussed in the movie but do not expect intrigue like in the ""I Claudius"" series (although Derek Jacobi who played Claudius also stars in ""the Gladiator""). The whole movie looked great and reminded me of movies like Spartacus and Ben Hur. The action was very well choreographed and was fun to watch, even if it was a little gory (we have to be realistic: using swords can be a bloody affair). Russel Crow carries the movie. You really feel his pain when his family is killed. Actually the entire cast was good. Hans Zimmer did a excellent job on the musical score. The runtime of the movie is about 155 minutes, and not once when i watched the movie i was bored, the movie is over before you know it. So ""The Gladiator"" is a movie you have to see at least once in your life.

Beautiful cinematography, sound work and lovely acting of Russell Crowe and all others made it a marvel. I didn't rated it 10/10 because I feel nothing in this world can ever be 100% though in past 20 years this movie never made me feel like it has gone old yet in coming 10 years there might be a movie that might be placed at higher level.

22 December 2000,Someone Please explain why it's so good...,"In all seriousness, will someone please try to explain to me what is it in this movie, besides the awesome action, that makes it that good. Honestly, I must have seen this movie a solid 7 times, twice in theaters. Every time I go into it trying to find what all the buzz is about. I still don't see it. Mind you, Crowe was great, most of the battle scenes where definitely on point, but why is it so good. What am i supposed to take out of this movie?

If you ask me it's overrated, but it could have been much better. The plot lacked as the movie progressed and the final battle was anti-climatic. No one can honestly tell me going into the final battle that they could not predict the outcome. It was by far Maximus's weakest opponent.

A pretty good movie, but if you ask me, I'd rather see Braveheart ten times before i watched that movie again.",7
8 July 2006,Spectacular,"A movie like Gladiator is extremely rare and the concept involved does raise some question marks. However, the movie is so well made and so brilliant that it makes this one of the greatest movies ever made in history. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely amazing and brilliant and I'm surprised that he gets little mention and is often overshadowed by Russel Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly one of the most underrated actors of all time. The special effects are brilliant and the gore depicted so realistically that the violent is impactful yet not disturbing. The only minor nitpick about this epic is how Commodus is so easily hated by all and maximus gets so much support and backing so easily.

6 September 2001,overrated,"I've seen this twice. Once in the theater and again on video. Each time was a disappointment. Judging from the look of the film it truly desires to be great, but ultimately it fails. Talk about woeful miscasting - Mr. Phoenix is atrocious (he is so much better in Clay Pigeons, and U-Turn). I can hardly watch him anytime he is on the screen. And what's with Lucilla's son? He looks like a pre-pubescent Adrian Lyne circa ""Fatal Attraction"". I disliked the score by Hans Zimmer - yet another component of a film that yearns to be epic, but isn't. Disappointing also in it's outright theft of Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"". Lisa Gerrard's beautiful voice is unquestionably suited for a vast, cinematic opus. This isn't it. This film suffered from too much explaining of it's special effects. Knowing how fake the Coliseum is with it's liberal use of CGI robbed me of any awe it could have produced. I didn't like the slow-motion effects in the opening battle scenes. And the dog jumping through fire? Please. A film that should have been great, but is just another over-hyped (but I did love the Kid Rock trailer-music promo), poorly executed waste of two hours.

22 May 2012,Absolutely Amazing,"This film is a masterpiece. I would type just that but IMDb requires ten lines so I guess I will say a few words. The film revolves around Maxmius, a Lead General that was a great friend to the emperor. Once the Emperors son takes over, Maximus loses his rank and ends up as a gladiator. Russell Crowe is an amazing actor and it shows in this movie. The plot,acting,characters,set,props and anything else that can be named is flawless. There is non-stop excitement when watching this film whether it is a massive fight scene or a tense emotional one. I was on the edge of my seat and it is absolutely breathtaking.

And yes Maximus, I am entertained.

8 April 2002,"Alas, the truth is not beholden...but it is I...","Gladiator reveiled the truth about Rome's past and its barbaric period. Russell Crowe was magnificent and filled more than he should in the role. And that is a very good thing. He was so truthful and mad the story seem so real. I cry whenever I see this movie, so far I watched it about 9 times and every time I cry so deeply. For I was touched and never want to kill a man for the taste of victory. I enjoyed the movie so much, I recomend it to parents who want their kids to know about story of what was once the ruler of the world. Is now a tourist attraction in Europe. I am very young and I never had nightmares because of this movie. I am not afraid. For if I do have a dream about it, I wake up crying because it was so sad. The movie touched my soul, and it will surely touch yours.

12 August 2003,An awesome film with excellent effects.,"Gladiator reminded me very much of The Patriot. Both men were respected because they were heroes, both are threatened by the enemy, both lose their families to the enemy(although in The Patriot, the man's wife was already dead), and both seek revenge for what has happened to their families. Gladiator, to me is one of those movies that leaves you thinking for several minutes after the ending. Gladiator is very well acted, very well directed, and has very good special effects.

Rated R for strong fighting, and gore.

24 October 2003,Very good movie,"It's a epic story set in ancient Rome. Roman's general, Maximus (Russel Crowe) fight in the arena as a gladiator, for vengeance. His family was murdered on the order of the bad emperor, Commodus. Maximus was badly injured and sold to the gladiator's school. He didn't have any hope - he wanted to die, but first he wants to kill Commodus. It's a story about friendship, loyality, honour and love, who wins over death. The movie's director is Ridley Scott, a famous British director (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Black Hawk Down). Fantastic good music composed by Hans Zimmer & Lisa Gerard (she's stars in the group Dead can dance). In my humble opinion - it is one of the best movies that I saw for the last five years.

11 September 2006,one of the best movies ever,"This is one of my best movies ever. I've read a lot of great reviews and a few bad eggs. Surprisingly to me the good eggs outweight the bad. The movie has an 80%+ acceptance and 20% not. From the 20% who said they didn't like the movie, well their description of the movie was quite dry. Pure context without content. They sound like they like blow up sheeps. Movies don't have to be real, or actual. Some have high expectations of the movie- boy should they have been directing the movie- we might get a piece of their mind.

This movie along with, Saving private ryan, top gun, braveheart, etc are my favorites.

16 November 2003,The General who became a Slave. The Slave who became a Gladiator. The Gladiator who Defied an Empire.,"At its barest bones, Gladiator is the tale of a wronged man seeking revenge. That plot framework will be familiar to most, but Gladiator combats its cliched roots well, offering dizzying action, political intrigue, and powerful visuals.

Perhaps the most stunning thing on display in this film is its all-around superb acting. Russell Crowe's turn here as Maximus earned him an Academy Award that solidified his stardom. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as the complex and disturbed Commodus. And the late Richard Harris is notable as the great, aging, philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (here is his last performance) and just about everyone else are also outstanding.

The title, `Gladiator,' brings to mind bloody arena contests, and the battle scenes don't disappoint - they are well-choreographed and filmed with creativity and intensity. (The graphic portrayals may be disturbing to some. If you don't like films that show blood and gore, don't see this one).

The Academy Award-winning special effects that resurrect ancient Rome and restore the Coliseum to its former greatness are triumphs, and the Academy Award-nominated score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, is riveting.

Some of the film is historically accurate, but most of it isn't - expect to be entertained, not informed. Plus, there are a few distracting goofs - such as the clearly breathing corpse in the foreground of several scenes, and another presumably dead man who blinks when a woman lowers her hand to close his eyes.

But these few blunders pale in comparison with Gladiator's many strengths. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy a good dramatic/action film that is also worthy of being called an epic. Gladiator is an astounding experience.

7 February 2018,Great movie,"This is one of the best movies I ever saw. Maximus has awesome armour and there are some cool swords. The opening fight scene is something I like to watch. If you like war movies, then this is a good one!

3 June 2005,My favorite movie,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
25 May 2000,10+ (out of 10),"I have waited for this movie almost a year. It's easy to be disappointed then. I was not. I have seen the movie twice, and will see it again.

Actually, we have seen it all before: We saw Titanic go down in many movies, but never as realistically as in the movie from 1997. We saw D-day in The Longest Day, but when we saw Saving Pvt. Ryan in 1998 we felt we were there. We have seen gladiators fight and ancient Rome hundreds of times, but this was something different. Why? Because of the possibilities of modern technique. You actually felt you could almost smell what you saw.

But Gladiator wasn't just special effects - it was a dramatic story as well.

Ridley Scott, I thank you for bringing back the genre I love so much, the historical epic. Let's hope the era for these films starts again.

There is only one bad thing with this film: it will lose very much on the small TV screen. See it on the big screen while you can!",
26 June 2000,"As his character commands legions, does Russel Crowe command his audience","In a spectacular historical drama such as Gladiator, the acting must be on the same scale or the whole thing becomes comical. Russel Crowe brings brings a style that portrayed a character of heroic proportions while at the same time making him accessible to the average person. Crowe has a approach to this role, as he did in ""The Insiders"" that shows the human foibles of his characters without making them look weak or pathetic, but rather human and vulnerable. This makes the character look all the more heroic in their pursuit of the quest, their meeting of the challenge. A hero is all the more appealing when he disposes of a truly despicable adversary. Meeting the challenge to provide the evil, in this tale of good over evil, is Joaquin Phoenix. This guy gave us a totally corrupt and spineless adversary from frame one. Playing the power hungry, selfish, insecure, lying and witless, son of the Emperor, who kills his own father to gain power and then tries to seduce his own sister to satisfy his warped desires, Joaguin succeeds handily at turning the audience to the side of the out manned and helpless hero. All of this played out on the stage and setting of ancient Roman Empire. The action scenes were spectacular and well thought out. The costuming was interesting, but I think not accurate historically. Except for a couple of incidences of scenery players, guards and line soldiers, chewing gum, I felt that Director Ridly Scott did a good job of taking us back to a time when there was only one ball game in town, The Roman Empire.

It reminds us that while world conflict takes nasty turns and is fraught with danger from the unknown and unknowable, it is equally dangerous to put all of the power into the hands of the few for the convenience of peace.",7
22 December 2022,So bad it's kind of decent,"This movie is FILLED to the brim with absolutely zero logic moments, actions, and content. All the movie has the constant feeling of the cheap corny Hollywood commercial understanding of what life was for roman soldiers, gladiators and citizens. It doesn't mirror reality and has so many flaws in the most very basic things it was 50% hard to watch, which is pretty bad for a movie. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely brilliant playing the role and is the main reason I could bare watching. He made Commodus such a realistic character, at a certain point I actually felt bad for him. He's truly a great actor. I don't regret watching this movie, and I can't say it's TRULY bad, but honestly it's not a good movie either. Picture it like this. It's like 300. Absolutely disconnected from reality and made to impress certain demographics. I'd say this movie wants to be like Braveheart, to be a story of love and war, but fails miserably at delivering the same authentic experience. Everything feels like it was grotesquely sewn with a very wide line of turquoise plastic. You simply can't ignore the stitches, they're Right in your face.

Oh and it was at least 1 HOUR too long.",6
14 June 2000,A Visual Stunner and Nice Escape on a Hot Summer day.,"First the good, I finally got to see what the big deal about the Roman Empire was. When you read it in books and see it in pictures it doesn't have the same punch as when it becomes a living breathing thing as it does in Gladiator. Russel Crowe is great as Maximus and Phoenix makes Commodus the biggest wussy in recent cinema. Overall, I give a big yippie-yahoo to Gladiator for a nice escape from whatever you are escaping from. My only complaint? It was just a wee bit long and the drama-love story aspect of it just was a bit of a letdown. How long did it take Maximus to get from Germania to his house anyway? Did anyone else notice that his hair had grown out? Who cares, right? Enjoy the show...but, I suggest you buy a snack and hit the head before settling in.

8 May 2000,Spectacular and entertaining,"This exceptionally well cast and beautifully directed 2-1/2 hour spectacle nevertheless left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied. It has neither the lyrical beauty of Last of the Mohicans nor the grit of Braveheart nor the deadpan violence of Private Ryan. But on the other hand, it stands up well against all of the Roman epics of the 50s and 60s, including the somewhat (in retrospect) sillier Spartacus. I felt like Gladiator had more to give but somehow it didn't. I never really felt, watching the movie, ""WOW! I need to see that again!"".

Gladiator will cement Russell Crowe's ""serious yet accessible"" actor status. Crowe will be beseiged with offers for the lead in the next ""Lethal Die Hard"". I kept trying to mentally rub the makeup off of Connie Nielsen to see if Annette Bening was hiding underneath.

I kept looking for James Mason and Patrick McGoohan. Well, Mason's dead, so he would have been hard to cast. (And where was Terence Stamp? Oh, he was a senator in the last Star Wars movie. Nevermind, that satisfies his ""senator quotient"" for the time being.) And surely there must have been a part for Patrick Stewart!

The score was surprisingly bland and uninvolving. Especially the Enya-esque themes used in the dream/hallucination sequences. This is one area where Last of the Mohicans had it all over Gladiator. You can be sure that any story holes in a Michael Mann movie will be patched over with wonderful music.

Gladiator is solid entertainment. It could have been more, but if nothing else, it means Ridley Scott is back to making good movies. Now, let's hope his next move is back into science fiction or adventure, and not Thelma and Louise: The Next Chapter.",
3 July 2001,"A real inspiring,beautiful and magical film","I first watched the film 'Gladiator' last year at home with my parents. Foolishly I didnt go to the movies to watch it, but my parents rented it out and as they had already seen and thought it was a 'must see' , me and my younger brother trusted their judgement. All i can say is 'WOW'. The film opens with that beautiful eastern-sounding music (Lisa Gerrerd) and from that moment I knew that this film was going to be unlike anything id seen before.The actual story is so wonderful and the director (Ridley Scott) and talented actors (Russell Crowe to name but one) make this film magical and definatly one that you won't forget in a hurry. I remember thinking to myself during the film 'Oh my god! this film is fantastic'. The ending is a guaranteed tear jerker, and i felt that lump in the back of my throat and knew that in a couple of seconds id feel my eyes filling up! Ive since bought the Film on video (watching it whenever i can!)I think I know each characters complete script!! I also purchased both the Gladiator soundtracks because me and my dad fell in love with the music! I love the way that Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer worked together so effectivly,they are definatly names we'll be hearing more of in the future! I enjoy all the tracks, as they all remind me of the movie, and I have listened and watched so many times that I know just from the music , which part of the film im at, and if i watched the film and turned down the volume i bet i could even tell you what music was playing! All i can leave you with is one comment 'Experiance Gladiator' You'll come away smiling,humming the music and Madly in love with the man you know you cannot have 'Russell Crowe'! A tip from me, There are certain situations where playing the soundtracks has been wonderful! 1) On the way to work..turn up the volume of those battle scenes and you'll soon be riding in a chariot rather that your Ford Focus! 2) In the bath, the slow romantic tunes are so magical! and finally 3) Listen to Elysium,Honor Him and Now we are free anywhere anytime and you'll instantly be taken back to ancient rome and that magnificant collisium!

8 May 2000,"Despite Flaws, Worth Seeing","At his best, few people can make a better movie than Ridley Scott. *Alien* and *Thelma and Louise* are masterpieces of two wildly different genres, sci-fi/horror and the on-the-run movie. Here, Ridley jumps into yet another genre, historical drama, and while his success isn't as great as it was in those two movies, it's still way ahead of some of his less successful efforts. (*Legend* comes to mind: a movie so boring that even Tom Cruise and Tim Curry couldn't save it.)

Let's talk about the bad stuff first STOP READING HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!

It's common for historical dramas to take liberties with the facts for dramatic effect. However, I hope it doesn't come as a surprise to you that no Caesar was ever killed in the Colloseum. Stop and think about that for a second: Suppose someone made a movie where they fudged the facts a bit so that Richard Nixon died in a duel with a The Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Okay, so this story isn't really historical fiction after all: It's historical fabrication.

While I heard some TV critic complain that the accents were all over the map in this film, that actually wasn't a serious criticism if he meant that all the accents should be Latin (a language whose pronunciation we can really only guess at, by the way), that's false. By this time (several centuries after Christ), Rome was a cosmopolitan empire, and its armies were drawn from all over the empire, from Scotland to Egypt. However, whenever Russell Crowe talked, I could close my eyes and hear shades of Mel Gibson. One accent you can be sure wasn't present in Ancient Rome was Australian.

The movie was strangely lacking in color. Almost everything was brown or metallic and dark. When the camera moved over the virtual recreation of the Colloseum, it looked like the Colloseum on a cloudy day.

Probably the worst visual problem is the filming of the battle scenes, which was done in a jerky style that gave the effect of something like 6 frames per second. This, combined with very hectic cutting and editing, made the battle scenes somewhat headache inducing.

The digital tigers were a bit less than convincing, too.

Okay, enough for the complaints. Now on to the praise.

Russell Crowe (accent aside) was perfectly cast for this role. Imposing enough to be believable as a master warrior, he is also a good enough actor to bring off the dramatic aspects of the role. I'm sure someone would have preferred Jean-Claude VanDamme or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but those would have been too much. This was not a kick-boxing epic or *Son of Conan the Barbarian*, after all.

All of the supporting performances were very good, I thought, and I must say that Connie Nielsen (Lucilla) is simply one of the most beautiful women on the screen today. (If she seemed vaguely familiar, but you couldn't quite place her, you probably saw her in *Mission to Mars*, *The Devil's Advocate*, *Rushmore* or *Soldier*.)

The story, despite being 100% historical hogwash, is compelling once you let ""willing suspension of disbelief"" kick in. The production design was first rate, too.

The computer-generated recreation of Rome and the Colloseum were pretty good, although the virtual tigers were less than 100% convincing, as I said earlier.

On the whole, I recommend this movie, though I wouldn't nominate it for *any* Academy Awards. But then, who am I?",
12 May 2002,"okay, but nothing to write home about *little spoiler*","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down.

13 October 2006,gladiator,"Gladiator is an extraordinary film because it is very spectacular and, at the same time, powerful, intense, vibrant, with a remarkable introspective analysis and representation.It also gives people a positive and edifying message. This film is accompanied by a splendid sound track, sometimes strong and intense, sometimes passionate and touching, that increase its value. Some passages of this sound track remind the music of Beethoven. In my opinion the film deserved more than five Oscars. In fact given that Gladiator in a very painstaking job, it should have deserved many more Oscars. For example I think that Gladiator is more exciting than Ben Hur which got eleven Oscars. Then I was very much disappointed that a a master as Ridley Scott, one of the best directors of the world, didn't win the Oscar. It's unfair that masters as Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrik have never won an Oscar. Every time I watch again the film I always think that it should have been still more memorable with the participation of Marlon Brando, who should have been perfect for the spirit and the style of the film. He should have been an unforgettable old roman senator. As a matter of fact in my life I have never seen an actor so able to express power, intensity, passion, magnetism, charisma. Just the characteristics of an important ancient roman personality.",10
13 December 2000,one of the few good ones this year,"After all the box office duds I had serious reservations about going to see this film. But after we got there - wow! I was completely glued to my seat and didn't even feel the true length of the film. It just flew by for me!

I wasn't prepared for such an epic! It may not have been another I Claudius, and definitely not historically accurate, but damn it was a good film!

The acting by Russell and Joaquin was fabulous. They were both very believable in their roles. A perfect tool for them to further their careers, I have no doubt!

The movie actually had a plot! I was pleasantly surprised to see some depth to the characters and the conflict felt so real - it made me feel like I was right there!

Ridley Scott did a bang up job with this movie. I have to hand it to him. Interesting angles, nice effects. A good movie all around!

19 May 2000,can i get a wide-angle shot please,"this movie was definitely entertaining. it was engaging, it had my full attention, and it was a visual feast...well, sometimes. but what is going on here? why does everyone love it exactly? i saw the film at one of the most beautiful theatres, the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd., which added to it a lot. but if i sat up front, i would have ran out of their screaming. people complain about the Blair Witch project? i didn't know what was going on half the time. this was me at about 5 points during the film: ""what? he got hit? yeah he did.. but.. he who? WHERE?!""

the recreation of Rome is fantastic, and those shots are excellent, as are the effects and art direction. the fights are fun in all their gore, with the exception of the chaotic camera movements. and certain shots, for example of the fields when Maximus's hands are brushing against the tall grass. beautiful. but not enough to get the praise it's been receiving.

and character development? hello? ""Lucilla, you should have been a son."" oh really? ""Lucilla is a strong woman this, and a forceful soul that."" how so? i couldn't tell. and bratty Commodus, played by an excellent Joaquin Phoenix, just was not fully explained in his insanity. Russell Crowe is great (as always) as the vengeful Maximus, but even with his character something seemed lacking. and way to go with the subtle ending. (no, that was not sarcasm).

overall the movie entertained me, but i walked out confused (as to whether i liked it or not). and when i walk out of movies confused i wait for the next day.. and the next day i was not satisfied. some great shots and color, cool costumes, Crowe finally confirming himself as a star, Phoenix confirming himself as an actor, and Nielsen confirming herself as a hottie who can act. it'll do. but it would have been better off had it been done by someone other than ridley scott. (gosh.. he better not butcher Hannibal). it deserves no spot on the IMDb's top 250 much less the top 100.",

31 October 2000,A must see film - but with some flaws,"Dont get me wrong - i totally enjoyed this film. It has action, history and love all rolled into one. In other words, passion simply oozes out of the screen at you.

However, I felt that the link between the battle scenes at the start and the gladiatorial combats was a bit weak. In fact, the battle scenes were in my eyes far more spectacular than the colluseum scenes. I wanted to find out more about the roman army - i wanted Maximus to continue his campaign. The scenes of the Roman army in combat were so utterly realistic that they took my breath away. I wanted to find out how this army conquered all of europe - hence my dissapointment when it was over after one battle scene.

So, the vista is left open for someone to tell the story of the Roman Legions - not about some trivial gorey battle in the Collesium, but about the real life and brutal facts about being in a Roman legion and going out there and conquering the world. That is a story that is still untold, and is waiting for some director to really do it justice.

On a final note - Russell Crowe was superb in this film - absolutely brilliant. A long , and Oscar awarded career awaits this guy. Watch out for him...",
13 December 2005,A fascinating picture of ancient Rome.,"""Gladiator"" is Ridley Scott's attempt at a sword-and-sandal epic, with Russell Crowe at the helm as Maximus. And it doesn't disappoint. The picture is beautiful, Scott pulls out all the stops with scenery, costumes, weapons, and (the most important) faces. This is a country who is recovering from brutal wars against the Germanic tribes who are, at this time, trying to take down this vast kingdom.

Maximus (Russell Crowe) is an instant fan-favorite. There is no growing up for this strapping military genius, he already knows his stuff. All we have to do is sit back and watch him do business. He outwits the antagonist to the point where he is in control (to understand this feet is to understand a Gladiator's position in the Roman caste). The villain, Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) plays a pathetic and sadistic young man who, much in the fashion of Macbeth, descends into darkness and uses violent means to achieve a position that was supposedly taken from him.

""Gladiator"" is worth seeing. The only complaint I give is the watering down of the characters who are devoid of any complexity, Ridley Scott tries too hard to distinguish who's who. He doesn't let the viewer decide. He might as well have his characters yell out, ""Hate me! I just killed a good guy!"" It would have been nice to see Maximus show a little of his darker side to the audience. A man who is a victim of a tyrannical dictator, a man who suffered the hanging and burning of his son and wife is not made of complete honor and integrity. At least not in reality.

28 July 2000,"""I Claudius"" meets ""Ben Hur""","The best parts in this movie are the action scenes. Not only are they expertly done, most of the violence is not graphic but inferred by clever use of sound effects. But, alas, there's a story. It's a variation on the much used ""evil twin"" formula, which for some strange reason brings to mind Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. It's not always believable, the characters are almost cardboard-like, and the dialogues sometimes range between formula and pretentious. The movie moves sluggishly between the action scenes, and seems to jumpstart each time. In short, it's not a bad movie, only it should (and could) have been much better, shorter and fast-paced.

5 June 2000,Don't believe the hype!,"Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is. For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.

Firstly, it is far too long. Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length. Wrong! I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film. It takes far too long to get going. After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins. This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.

The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen. You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film. That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement. It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.

Thirdly, there is far too much CGI. Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill. And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful. Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.

Fourthly, historical accuracy... oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...

And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!

I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.",6
8 July 2001,Why I prefer Spartacus,"I found this film to be massively overhyped, and was unbearably derivative, particularly of Spartacus.

Spartacus, on he other hand, is one of my all time favourite films. And given the immense similarities, I should have at least found Gladiator ntertaining. And I figured out why I didnt today - characters. Gladiator has none. Maximus the Gladiator is deliberately played by Crowe as a walking Zombie throughout the film, the Emperor is barking mad, and only Oliver Reed's part has any sort of substance, and even then is a carbon-copy of Peter Ustinov in Spartacus.

And speaking of carbon-copies, the emperor bears a strong resemblance to John Hurt as Caligula in the classic tv series I, Claudius (incidentally, Derek Jacobi, Claudius in that series, crops up in a small role here). However, Hurt's character had far more depth and believabilitly, and most importantly, was better played.

None of the other characters here really got anything to do, so that rules them out as well.

At least the emperor was fairly enjoyable to watch. Joaquim Phoenix has a lot of potential, he should go far.

And another thing. The score was dreadful. God knows why it sold so well. And God knows how come this film got so any Oscars. Russell Crowe as best actor? How difficult is it to look grim and stand still a lot? Dear oh dear.

The best scene was the opening battle. That, at least, was brilliantly filmed and very powerful. If only the rest could have lived up to it.

If you liked this, you should vastly prefer Spartacus and I, Claudius. If you havent seen this, dont bother and watch those instead.",6
27 October 2000,Breathtaking!,"GLADIATOR

***** See this now! **** Great! *** Quite Good! ** Not Horrible, Nor Good. * Big Mistake!

Gladiator was everything I expected it to be. A brilliant acheivement and an Oscar-worthy flick.

Maximus (Russell Crowe) is told he must be the Roman emperor from the sick and dying current emperor of Rome. Maximus tells the emperor he must go home and see his wife and child. Not long after, The Emperor's son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) discovers that his father was planning on letting Maximus take charge of Rome and puts Maximus in the Roman arena, to battle the champion gladiators. And, wouldn't you know it...in the blink of an eye, Maximus has become a hero!

Gladiator is an exciting, excellent and breathtaking flick. Although the history is inaccurate, Russell Crowe's born-for-it performance as Maximus makes you forget all the possible flaws about this memorable, brilliant film.

*****",9
11 June 2021,"Cliche, but good nonetheless","Acting (10)

Exceptional performances from the entire cast. Of particular note are Phoenix's portrayal of the petulant emperor and Crowe's honorable, vengeful Maximus.

Plot (4)

The plot is simple, and at times unrealistic. For example, it wasn't clear why the crowd in the Colosseum was okay with their emperor deciding to duel Maximus. Wouldn't this have been incredibly strange?

Characters (5)

The characters are largely cliche and uninteresting. Gracchus and Proximo had potential, but weren't developed enough.

Sound (9)

The music was wonderful. Gave the film an epic feel. I really liked ""Honor Him"".

Cinematography (6)

Nothing special. CGI Colosseum looked a bit choppy.

Enjoyment (8)

This is a revenge story that ends well. While simple, the plot is one anyone can get behind. Together with superb performances and a great soundtrack, the film has an epic feel to it, as if you're hearing the tale of a hero passed down through legend.

Overall (7)

Average of scores.",7
26 October 2000,Enjoyable,"A very entertaining movie with a reasonable storyline. More flashy but not as good as ""The fall of the Roman Empire"" which had better acting.

The action footage was excellent but some of the character to character dialogue could have been improved, also the actor playing Commodus wasn't very convincing. Special effects were excellent, the creation of the atmosphere of the Colosseum was breathtaking. You felt like you were there.

Opening battle scene was brilliant. Go see it!

14 December 2000,A MUST SEE,"""Gladiator"" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled.

""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece with all the trimmings and is destined to be an instant classic.

Also, ""Gladiator"" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. Learning about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome. The film is so rich with history of these items people do not even have to visit to learn about Rome; nonetheless, if ""Gladiator"" did one thing it made me want to visit Rome.

Gladiator"" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film. ""The Patriot"" and ""Braveheart"" were very similar to ""Gladiator"" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood.

""Gladiator"" may not win best picture of the year at oscars next year, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know ""Gladiator"" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did.",
17 March 2001,in the top 3 as a masterpiece,"i personally believe that of all films top notch as the biggest hits. This should fall somewhere within the first 3.

I believed the cinematography, cool fight scenes, a great length in running time and a reasonable plot with a great actor really filled in positive slots. Making there be no room for negative comments. I saw this a month ago and the whole thing was a memorial to me.

I'll never think of Rome or Russell Crowe the same again.

17 June 2002,Masterful historic epic,"Brilliant acting, brutal battle sequences, and a concise story propel ""Gladiator"" to epic status, making it quite possibly the greatest epic of Ancient Rome ever filmed, rivalled only by ""Spartacus"".

Russell Crowe proves himself to be one of the great actors of our time as he plays General Maximus, a man who only wants to live a quiet, peaceful life with his family. Instead, Maximus is hailed for his abilities in battle, first on the battlefield as he helps Emperor Marcus Aurelius expand the Empire, then in the gladiator arena after he is betrayed, sold into slavery, and forced to kill for the entertainment of the barbaric masses. Crowe shows us the General's quiet desperation to get home after the battle in Germania, his unimaginable shock at finding his family murdered, and his intense desire to avenge his family by killing Commodus, a range of emotions that many actors these days have trouble playing convincingly, but which Crowe handles perfectly.

But a hero is only as good as his nemesis is bad, and Joaquin Phoenix portrays the insane Emperor Commodus flawlessly. Commodus is shown as more than a crazed dictator; he is shown as a young man who wanted to feel love from his father, but couldn't, even when his father tried to express his love for Commodus. His unsettling passion for his sister makes the audience dislike him, but his apparent love for his nephew makes him seem human, until he threatens the boy near the end. The audience comes to hate Commodus, but there is also a feeling of pity for him, and that is a hard balance for an actor to maintain. Phoenix shows that he has a long, impressive career ahead of him, and in my opinion, he should have been awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he was nominated for this role.

Everything about this production is remarkable, from the almost Wagnerian score to the jarring choreography and cinematography of the battle sequences. A true masterpiece of movie making.",10
7 December 2006,love it,"this is by far the best movie i have ever seen. i love every min of the movie. it was sad entertaining made me jump from my chair and also laugh at times i like the mix of people they had. the crazy weird brother ruler, the lovable sister who was strong. the hero and his gang of brothers. on the Lil boy who love excitement and of course the crowd of people who cheer for blood death and more blood-Crow does a great job in acting in this movie he really made his character come alive. i have watch this movie many times and i still can not get enough of it. i try to watch it on TNT when it comes on by i find myself go to get my DVD and watch it uncut because there is no other way to watch this movie.10 of 1o!!! excellent

1 July 2021,"Awesome movie, actors and music.","I don't know what it is with this movie, but every time (5x) it blows me away.

For me it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

So I had to make this journey to The Colosseum in Rome where it all happened thousands of years ago.

And believe me it was amazing.

The very friendly guide told me all about gladiators and offcourse he knew the movie.

Rome is one big open air museum, But The Colosseum is one of the biggest highlights with great history.

6 October 2002,"2003-2004 will prove better, I hope","A host of Roman related films such as Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, The Robe, Fall of the Roman Empire, etc. preceeded Gladiator. I enjoy Russell Crowe but felt his Oscar award should have waited for A Beautiful Mind...not Gladiator. Juaquin Phoenix was very nearly as good as Christopher Plummer's Commodus in Fall of the Roman Empire. I enjoyed watching the film for it's special effects and opening battle scene to see how closely Scott came to recreating a real battle. I looked at the costuming, weaponry, etc. and in all respects I think Ridley Scott did an outstanding job...I was convinced I was seeing Rome, Romans, and Roman battle.

But, the story itself paled in comparison to the wonderful effects! I felt in my heart the animosity, the loathing that came between Ben Hur and Messala. I did not get that kind of feeling with Maximus and Commodus. You cannot help but feel the agony of Ben Hur who, having defeated his mortal enemy, finds out from Messala's last words that the ""race is not over"". At the end of Gladiator, it's ""who will help me carry a great Roman"" and off we go.

I never quite understood why the other gladiators were so quick to die for Maximus. After all, he was there to kill them. (the charioteers from the Battle of Zama scene were gladiators also..at least that's how it would have historically been). I could not buy into Commodus's thinking on letting Maximus live. The real Commodus would not have hesitated, Maximus would have been executed on the spot when he revealed his face. I'm hoping that more classically developed stories of ""real"" characters will be well filmed when they show up in 2003-2004 (""Alexander the Great"", ""Troy"" and ""Hannibal""). I'd love to see Ridley Scott-style special effects in all these but...with story lines that I can really feel in my gut.",8
25 May 2000,total crap,"The fight scenes are so awful I couldn't believe it. All in slow motion or fast forward it looked to me like Charlie Chaplin directed the fight scenes and not Ridley Scott. 100 years of movie development and he goes and shoots the movie in slow motion, give me a brake, If the movie theatre wouldn't be so crowded I'd walk out in first 15 minutes of this movie.

3 August 2004,Watching it again led me to wonder...,"...about the historical accuracy of the film. So, I did a few minutes of online research, and what I found was mildly distubing: the story borrows from history the names, dates and significant events (the conquering of Germania), but the plot is essentially fact-free, at least as far as what we know of Roman history can tell us.

I find this somewhat irksome because it's using just enough history to sound as though it's telling a fact-based story, when in fact it's fiction. Admittedly, there are others who take far more egregious liberties with the truth (Oliver Stone comes to mind) but the taking of names from history seemed pointless and a little misleading.

This is admittedly a nit against a tremendous film that deserved all the critical acclaim it received, but I do wish directors would be a little more discerning when it comes to blending fact and fiction.

9 August 2004,Four years on and still as strong,"Upon release this film set the world on fire. It was an amazing achievement. Four years on and it has lost some of its original charm but most of what made it great still remains. Russell Crowe deserves to be a superstar based on this performance alone. He controls the screen with such ease he was destined for good things from this moment onwards. This film also kick-started Ridley Scott's second career high which is a good thing for the movie world as he can be one of the best directors when he wants to be. The score by Hans Zimmer is as amazing as usual, I can't recall the man creating a bad soundtrack for a movie.

Now for the downside. The film is only really good when Crowe is on screen. Joaquin Phoenix put in an amazing performance as the new Emperor but that didn't help the scenes in Rome from being very boring. I also can't help but cringe at the ending, only because watching the slaves walk out into the coliseum and stand around while Connie Neilsen badly acts being sad was a terrible way to end such a good film.

1 June 2000,Maximus entertainment!,"Wow! An action movie that's great to look at, fun, exciting, and has political intrigue to boot. From the opening battle against the barbarians to the Colisseum death matches, the action never disappoints. Ridley Scott tries to spare us some exposure to the extreme violence with quick choppy shots...for which I was grateful. Great performances by all actors, especially the macho,sullen Crowe and a fascinatingly creepy Pheonix. And the wonderful costumes definitely deserve a mention at the next Oscars. Well worth paying full price on the biggest screen in your town.

28 August 2010,"Gladiator, 2000","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",9
1 June 2000,"Sword and sandal epic revived, as boring as ever","So Hollywood revived the long forgotten sword and sandal epic, absent from the screen in the last decade(s). In the case of Gladiator, it would have better still not be revived.

Gladiator comes along as a multi-million, box-office super-seller with actually nothing behind it. We get the mass battle scenes, some sword-dancing fights between gladiators and a lot of togas. The plot: not outstanding, the characters: clich√©-like. No character gets really developed, everything is aimed at a sensual overflow (sometimes intersparsed with un-motivated sun-set shots). In addition to that, the shooting is quite poor: murky, unfocused and plain. The body count is high, but triggers no emotions (kind like a splatter movie in sandals..)

To put it simple: I had to fight to stay awake, save your (over-time) money for some better films.

12 May 2000,Disappointingly Lacking,"When going to a Ridley Scott movie, I always feel a sense of security that I will be delighted with the cinematography, if nothing else. This foray into computer enhanced filming is horrible. Cleopatra, 30 years ago, was far more realistic since it was...well...real. Certainly, computers reduce the cost to produce a movie of this scope, but one is always aware that one is looking at a computer image. In old movies, where sets were built, there was no way to be sure that the movie wasn't filmed at an old ruin. The scenery was made of physical materials, not virtual images. Every time I saw those little pixels in the Coliseum flickering I was totally distracted. The whole movie, from a technical standpoint, is a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""

28 July 2001,Good but Oscar worthy???,"Ok is it oscar worthy yes and no. It is a very good movie and should get awards for the Visual effects as they were absalutly wonderful but best picture??? I think Not. For one yes it did have good directing but Ang Lee was better in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Acting. Ok it did have good acting but sorry Tom Hanks Did a better job then Russell Crowe. Other then that yes it was a good movie it had a ok storyline and for the acting that was good but lacked a few things as did the story line. For one the story was the same throughout the whole movie you knew what was going to happen before it happened. Fight after Fight. Sorry he wouldn't have lasted but maybe 3 fights not as many as he did. So people say it's a movie it dosn't have to be accurate. Well I think it should be somewhat accurate. other then that it did hold my attention and the music was totally good. Richard harris did a good job. It's a good movie and it's worth watching but it really didn't earn best picture in my opinion. That would go to crouching Tiger hidden Dragan. (own both on DVD) I'd Give it a 8/10

6 May 2000,A masterpiece that reaches back 1800 years to become ahead of its time!,"An evil leader who acquires power by lies and brutality. An evil man who despite the efforts of many good men continues to prevail. An evil man who wants to remove all the remaining traces of the republic. An evil man who wants to be loved by the people but is twisted and perverted . An evil man whose sole talent is knowing how to play to the mob. It is so close to the current situation in Washington that I'm surprised this movie was even made.

The beginning of the end of Rome started when Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army and turned Rome from a republic to a dictatorship. A similar point was reached recently when a corrupt and cowardly senate declared that a president in effect was above the law. Abuse of power was free to flow from that point and the life of Rome slowly flowed away with it.

This movie if anything embodies the hope that men of good character can still overcome a juggernaut of evil and turn the tide. To say that this movie provokes no thought or that the ending was a letdown only shows that they did not understand the greater significance of this movie. How it speaks to our own time and offers hope and inspiration to those few good men still remaining. That in this dark hour, when stock options act like bread and circuses to mask the accumulating corrupt concentration of power to one evil man, that character still DOES count and that good men with strength and honor can still prevail.",10
23 November 2000,"Nice effects, shame about the bits in-between","The gladiator scenes were, of course, stunning, it's just a shame that the movie tries too hard to be ""I Claudius"" in-between. By the second or third scene with the Emperor we know that he's thoroughly evil so we don't need it to be re-emphasised again and again. I'd replace some of those scenes with a really good chariot race!

6 April 2001,A well deserved oscar....,"To all the people who bash this film and or the performances..You obviously have no idea what your talking about. Russell Crowe(though he fared much better in L.A Confidential) was nothing short of brilliant. The directing was top notch by one of Hollywood's A-list directors. I do believe there was a flaw in the computer graphic's. The coliseum did not look real at all. My only complaint.

Just because a film is ""Hollywood"" and has a big budget does not make it a bad film. Hollywood has produced the greatest films ever made. Yes, Hollywood does favor historical epics but I think you have unfairly judged this film.

If you pretentious people want to sit around drinking zima, watching masterpiece theater or the latest Peter Greenway film, pretending not to be bored go ahead. I'll take Gladiator any day.

Strength And Honor... **** out of **** stars

22 February 2001,Old fashioned fun.,"When I first saw GLADIATOR in the theatre, I was amazed. I hadn't seen anything like it before. When I saw it on video, I began to actually consider the film, as one always does. I found it quite different.

What makes a motion picture good. The acting has to be good, the story original, the directing careful and good, the dialogue realistic, the screenplay well written, the cinematography original AND good, and entertaining.

In Gladiator, the acting is great, fantastic, even. Phoenix is evil as Commodus, Harris on target as Marcus Aurelius, Nielson convincing as Commodus' sister, and seems to care for Maximus and her child. Russell Crowe amazing, being exactly what the writer and director wanted him to be: tough, caring, slightly emotionless, though, and at times funny.

The story is quite original, it mixes true historical events and fictional sequences alike to create something wholly new. The pacing is perfect, and the dialogue and screenplay are good. The sub plots are involving and one comes to care for the charcters.

The cinematography tells a good story. Old fashioned camera angles are used, as well as technically impressive photographing techniques are employed in the film. The action scenes are exactly what Scott wants them to be, confusing, violent, compelling, and showing not only the common horrors of war and violence, but also those invovled's feelings and what it was like to be there in them.

There is no question that Gladiator is not entertaining- it is! Old fashioned Rome stuff and today's violence, as well as involving charcters.

So why not like the film? Okay, there are historical inaccuraces, but Scott doesn't want it to be real. Spartacus had inaccuraces, Ben-Hur did, too, no one is complaining of them.

In addition to the above things, the art direction is beautiful, the score compelling, the costume design good (however inaccurate), and some good old Braveheart style violence.

I keep thinking to myself, this film isn't that great, it doesn't even deserve a nomination, but then I think about what I tell you, and I realize it really is a great film.

I have not seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Chocolat, so I can't say anything about those. However, Erin Brokovich was just awful! But I'm reviewing Gladiator here. Traffic was gret too, but I have only seen it once in the theartre, so I have not really had a chance to truly evaluate it.

In conclusion, Gladiator is an amzing film, not to be missed. I give it eight out of ten, but even now I find that I am giving it a lesser score than I think it should. I don't want to like this film, but I can;t help it!",7
19 January 2022,Good,"An epic, historical film by the master of such films by Ridley Scott. Absolutely deservedly has a lot of awards, including 5 Oscars. The story of the Roman commander Maximus, who became a gladiator and lost his family due to intrigues. The film has amazing scenes with fights, I can't even believe in their staging. Russell Crowe, who played the main role of a noble and honest warrior, is very good, it's just a pleasure to watch him play. Of course, we need to say separately about the music of Hans Zimmer, which is one of the main actors of the picture, it is so expressive.

26 March 2001,"Entertaining, but really.....","After the Academy Awards, I have to temper my displeasure a bit. This was not a bad movie at all. It is quite good compared to, say, Demetrius and the Gladiators. But this has to be the most overrated movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. Even more overrated than Titanic. Take one part Spartacus, one third Braveheart, and one third Caligula and blend. The female character is pure window dressing, the effects are poor but thankfully used sparingly.The period armour and weapons are all wrong. The tacked-on ""going home"" racial liberation bit at the end is pure hokum. In it's defense, the film does have two very fine performances (rewarded) and some terrific action sequences.

Still, I am sad that we could not have seen the award go to one of the more challenging and visionary films, Crouching Tiger or Traffic. Sometimes popcorn is just popcorn, even with heavy butter. ** 1/2 stars, seven out of ten.

4 January 2022,"An astounding, ambitious and inspiring historical epic","Ridley Scott, writer and director of Alien which I also deem to be the best Horror movie of all time alongside ""The Thing"", puts on display once again his sheer mastery and dedication for his work.

Set in my personal favourite historical period, Scott makes sure to maximize the desperation and pain of the main character, further elevated by Crowe's superb acting performance.

From start to finish you can't help but hope with all of your heart that our protagonist will be able to push through all the misery and grime of the gladiatorial pits, which hide an ironic barbarism under the perceived ""light"" of Rome, as Maximus once describes it.

With very strong themes and an acumen for how to set up the right scenes with competent dialogue and directing in order to always send these positively piercing rush of emotions to his viewers, Ridley Scott never lets this film become stale at any point during the runtime.

Rusell Crowe embodies his character so well but it is worth nothing that without Joaquin's Phoenix masterful performance of the cruel, sleazy and emotionally scarred Commodus, the film's story would have never been so engaging. All of this combines into one of the most hated villains in cinematic history yet you can see where all of Commodus's frustrations came from, the lack of consideration and love as well as his own grand expectations of what was yet to come, all crashing down into a world of hurt which broke him.

Besides for it being entertaining and competent, the dialogue is also very solemn and inspiring a lot of the time, which results in the film containing so many memorable quotes.

It would be a crime to not mention the superb musical score from Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard that accompanies and enhances all of the emotionally resonant scenes.

The action is fantastic as well, there are some close-ups which almost puts us on the field of battle with the camerawork making it feel like you are amongst the people who are fighting. Other times we get some beautiful wide shots of all the action, the cinematography is also superb and there's some really smart use of colors that set the tone of some scenes.

The ending is not only satisfying all things considered, but very appropriate to the story and the theme of vengeance.

All in all, masterful execution of a very simple but emotional and engaging story that deals with strong mature themes.",10
18 February 2001,Overrated Garbage,"This movie redefines ""overrated."" It is nothing more than a paint-by-numbers revenge tale in which Russell Crowe does his best impersonation of a wooden board for a couple of hours. A more boring experience at the movies I cannot recall. And, to me, the worst part was the subpar special effects. This is something that you would expect a movie with this director and budget to really excel at, but in reality the fight scenes are just terrible. The animals in the Colosseum are clearly computer-generated, and their presence in these scenes provides nothing more than a chuckle. Unless you are a masochist of the highest degree, I would advise you to steer clear of Gladiator.

13 July 2012,The struggle of a man in finding justice,"Gladiator has been my most favorite film of all time. It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imagery and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting. All other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.",8
11 February 2006,And here it is! My favorite movie of all time!,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",10
30 March 2022,Amazing Movie,"One of the best epic movies ever!

The story is very compelling and I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.

10 June 2017,One of the best i've seen,"Gladiator is about the warrior Maximus . The film is set in Italy back in the Roman age . It tells the story of Maximus the warrior who became a gladiator that fights for his life in the arenas.

I love the story and the performance of the actors in the film . Russel Crowe stars as Maximus and Juaquin Phoenix plays the role of Commodus ( the son of the emperor ) . Commodus is my favorite character because he has a very interesting personality .

I think this is an ideal film for people who like action movies and bloody combats . It is a bit sad but it has a great ending to it

26 April 2000,"An epic for the 21st Century, visually stunning and absolutely engaging.","Being lucky enough to get a pass to a preview of this film I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be good, but I had no idea. It was great. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, the great Roman general and right hand man to Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. As well written as the film was, Crowe delivers an excellent performance as Maximus, making it nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance himself playing Aurelius' son Commodus who assumes the role of emperor after his father's death in an underhanded manner. Phoenix's portrayal punctuates Commodus' despicable demeanor. This film transports you to the era in the theater. It's totally engaging and shot beautifully. I really loved this film and I will gladly fork over my 8 bucks when it's released. Gladiator appears to be the first great Epic of the 2000's.

7 May 2000,People give this movie too much credit,"Although it was not a bad movie, it was not all that good of a movie either. Ridley Scott seems to get more entertaining scripts every time he directs, but he gets worse and worse at directing. The battle scenes drove me up the wall. The cameras are so close-up that all we can see is blood and movement. The resolution is grainy and dirty looking, which makes it even harder to see. Scott must also believe that the only way to show battle is by filming it like a music video. A few seconds of a camera shot is shown, then a second of another shot, then another shot, then another and another for five minutes straight. Now it's not only hard to see, but dizzying as well. A better director would have used longer shots to show off good fight choreography, development and tactics of battle. But Scott takes the easy way out.

Now we know we can't rely on the director for a good movie. The cast overall is good. Commodus (Phoenix) has a few good moments, but is just too dull to be enjoyed as a villain. Scott tries to give us pity for the bad guy to add depth to his character, but it doesn't work. I didn't feel anything for him, hatred or pity. I was a little surprised that Phoenix wasn't better than he was in the role of Commodus. He is a talented actor and he was by far the best part of '8mm', but he will work for this movie. The supporting cast does a good job in few scenes that they posses. The gladiators are big and mean enough, the senators do their job to move the story along, but the best supporting performances come out of Proximo (Reed) and Commodus's sister, Lucilla(Nielson).

As important as the supporting cast is, everything rides on Crowe's performance as Maximus. He does wonderful. He carries this movie on his back with little help. He broods and glares and doesn't talk much. He has great reaction shots and is a good physical actor. Without him, this movie has little redeeming qualities.

With Crowe leading the charge, the movie is marginally entertaining and worth going to see. But don't sit to close to the screen, the camera shots might make you nauseous.",7
6 October 2022,Classic Epic Movie Of Ancient Rome,"Where to begin...the wardrobe is amazing, the characters are so believable that years after watching these characters in other productions, one either roots for, loathes or pities these actors. The storyline is believable and we see even today the corruption of leaders and their followers for personal gain. We also see the loyal and morally driven with a purity of white hot unfaltering purpose. Russell Crowe epitomizes the Roman soldier's spirit of duty, while Joaquin Phoenix encompasses all that is evil when powers corrupts completely. This is also a brilliant story of balance of good and evil, family and power, greed and contentment. It is a must see movie.

24 June 2000,"Don't listen to those self centered critics, this movie is wonderful!","Gladiator will definitely win various Oscars next year because of the following.

Breathtaking score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard.

Artistic direction by Ridley Scott.

Wonderful Cinematography.

Terrific acting by all cast members.

And the film's impact on the viewers which stays in memory long after they leave the theater. Movies like this don't come often which is saddening.

I can only look at the people who complain and slam this film and wonder what the hell is wrong with them. They are poison people don't listen to them.

Now comes the extremely difficult task which is to wait for the DVD release which might not happen until 4 or 5 months from now, as well as the Hannibal motion picture the Scott will give us next year. (sigh)",
12 October 2000,Movie of the Year and Ridley Scott's Best work yet!,"A wonderful, spectacular film which we will still remember 20 years from now. Dreamworks best picture, Ridley Scott's best picture since Blade Runner, and the best piece of cinema sitting in the Universal Pictures film vault. Come Oscar time this film will take the awards ceremony by storm.

20 July 2000,Russell Crowe is a Roman god,"This movie was fantastic. Far from just a typical guts n' gore warrior flick, the actors succeeded at portraying genuine feeling, emotion, and motivation for their actions. While on the surface, the plot line may seem implausible, the characters' passion brings it to life and a shocking reality. You walk out of the theater honestly believing that Maximus' desire for vengeance, combined with his skill as a general, could lead him from slavery to the doorstep of the emperor. And as if that were all not enough, Russell Crowe is a modern-day Adonis. I'll be first on line when the DVD comes out.

22 October 2022,Great historical film,"As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.

So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.",7
