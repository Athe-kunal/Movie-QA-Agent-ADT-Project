17 June 2019,A romcom for effed up people,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
29 December 2012,Stunningly accurate look at the bipolar life.,"I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.

I did not know what to expect from this movie. It is a stunningly accurate trip into the mind of a BP sufferer. It shows the disease from the outside, too. It is amazing in its accuracy. The mood swings, the detachment from reality, the failure to learn from past errors are there. Here is a guy who has so messed up he is in the hospital. He is released into the custody of his parents. He improves himself physically yet cannot see what he has done, what he is now, and what the future portends with any sort of reality.

There are other situations in the film which mirror the BP life. There are job losses, broken relationships, unlimited optimism, anger, and a feeling that no one understands you. But he doesn't even understand himself. He thinks he is the only sane person around. He is in complete denial yet goes along with treatment just to get along with others.

The obsession with his estranged wife drives him. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her.

Then there is the hair trigger and the propensity toward violence which ultimately put him into the hospital. He has the belief that he sees with much more clarity than anyone else. There is also the hatred of medications and the belief that he doesn't need them.

Yet, there is hope. There is no miraculous cure. There is a negotiated peace between his illness and the way he must be to survive in the world.

The only thing I felt was missing was the crushing depression. But I understand that. Depression makes for lousy movies. The film is strictly about a manic life that wants to be better but cannot accept that he is badly off dead center normal.

If you are bi-polar and under control, see this film! If you live with or deal with a BP, see this movie. If you are untreated, you won't get it because BP clouds the mind.

My new wife and I went to see it. Up front I told her that I had this mental illness. She still married me. She is a health care worker with an understanding of illness and of treatment. After the film she asked me what I thought.

I told her that I was a bit frightened to tell her that the portrayal is spot on and that I had seen all of it before.

But like all bipolar sufferers, I wanted her to know that ""I was never that bad."" The truth is, I was....but we BP people don't handle reality all that well.",9
8 September 2020,Entertaining & good story about bipolarity.,"I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I can't really see why people would dislike this movie. Even if it's not really my genre of movie I thought this one was very captivating. Bradley Cooper did a really good job playing his bipolar character, to me it was one of his best performances yet. The Oscar for best female actress went to Jennifer Lawrence, which surprised me a bit, even though she did a good job here. But to me Bradley Cooper is the star of Silver Linings Playbook. The rest of the cast was also excellent, all contributing to make this movie very enjoyable to watch, with some good giggles, but most of all an interesting story. I find stories about the ""little bit crazy"" people always fascinating to watch and in Silver Linings Playbook Cooper did a great job playing a bipolar. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the extremely negative reviews on here, those people rarely are satisfied by anything in life.

16 November 2012,"It's a platinum lining, not just silver.","""I'm remaking myself."" Pat (Bradley Cooper)

Silver Linings Playbook doesn't play by the current romantic comedy book—No scatology, nudity, f-bombing, or feminist and gay bashing. It's simply a smart playbook about the mental institution's recently-released Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boy-man shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradley's new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).

But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized.

After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).

The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pat's relationship with that ""slut,"" Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingway's ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know you're in a film that follows no particular playbook.

The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bi-polar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes.

Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, you'll confirm she's one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year.",

16 October 2018,Enjoyed it,"People are saying that it's ""offensive"" and ""too happy"" to be real, and that surprises me. As someone who lives with mental illness (severe major depression with severe psychotic features), and was in psych ward for quite a while, I didn't find it offensive. I found it to be remarkably accurate in portraying some of my own struggles, with mind-dulling medications, unwanted outbursts, deep paranoia, odd tics, etc. that I have had for over ten years. As for the ""overly happy"" stuff? Too many movies and TV shows focus on being ""dark"" and ""edgy"", so I found it refreshing to see someone going through struggles being positive about it. I won't pretend to have had the most difficult life, but it hasn't been easy. I saw this movie a few months after I was released from psych ward (2016), and I can honestly say it gave me a bit of hope to find my own silver lining. The world needs more positivity.

13 August 2013,De Niro is back,"While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again. And a role we as viewers would actually like to see him in too. There have been a few lesser roles he played over the past couple of years. And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won't remember him for a movie called ""Freelancers"" and others in that vain.

But back to the leading couple. A couple that is really so far apart, that you know what that ultimately means for them. But Bradley Coopers character has a lot more going on than that. There are relationships that went wrong and it's really tough sometimes to watch him destroying himself or at least attempting to. A very good movie, with great dialog

8 September 2018,Crazy love for Jennifer Lawrence!,"This is without a doubt THE movie that launched Jennifer into stardom. And deservedly so! For all those who love Jennifer Lawrence and for some unexplicable reason havent yet seen this gem there is only advice: stop reading this review and start watching!

But this movie is much much more than just a fun filled Jennifer flick, because David O Russel wrote and directed this crazy love classic, a movie about 2 people who are crazy and in love. The guy is played by Bradley Cooper and besides his other role in ""American Hustle"" I truly feel that this is his best performance ever.

All David O Russell pictures are about families in chaos. Utter chaos. BUT despite all the chaos and craziness in David O Russell's pictures there is always a true love at the heart to be found. That is what makes Russell's pictures so endearingly huggable, loveable and crazy positive. It is so touching and uplifting to see the craziest dysfunctional people fall in love and support eachother despite all their sorrows, fights and utter craziness.

Terrific supporting role by Robert de Niro! Splendid soundtrack. Great story. What more could one wish for? It is the craziest christmas feel good film I have ever seen. Gotta see this one!",9

29 June 2013,You'd be crazy to miss this,"Based on a novel by Matthew Quick, David O Russell has both written and directed this variation on the romantic comedy in which both main characters are deeply damaged and variably medicated.

Patrick used to be a teacher before he beat up a fellow teacher (he deserved it) and was diagnosed as bi-polar and confined to a mental institution for eight months. Tiffany used to be married to a cop who died in circumstances for which she feels blame and she has not been behaving as quietly and demurely as is expected of the newly bereaved. Both lead roles are played by attractive and talented young actors: Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") and Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") and, by the time I caught up with the movie on DVD, Lawrence had been awarded a deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for this quirky performance.

One of the distinctive features of this wonderful film is that most of the characters are obsessive to one extent and in one form or another, most notably Pat's father who is charmingly portrayed by veteran Robert de Niro. At turns funny and poignant, this is at heart a plea for us to be tolerant of others because - let's face it - we're all a little crazy.",
3 July 2013,Life Is a Lot More Complicated/A Psychiatrist's Buffet,"I have to agree that Jennifer Lawrence is darn good in this. Bradley Cooper overacts with the best of them. But as I watched it unfold, I just couldn't buy into it. Of course, this is ultimately a comedy, though it is a dark comedy. Cooper is completely out of control when he is off his meds. This is pretty well presented at the beginning as he rants about getting back together with his wife (after having nearly beaten her lover to death). His strained relation with his father, a bookie/Philadelphia Eagles Fan/and a raving OCDer, is in the forefront. The dad, played by Robert DiNiro is about as off his trolley as Cooper. The mom wants everything to be nice, and is constantly caught in the middle of these ""crazy"" people. DeNiro has been banned from the Eagles' stadium because of rowdy behavior in the past and believes his not being present is the reason for their lack of success. Anyway, Cooper hooks up with Jennifer Lawrence who is newly widowed. She is also a nut case. She becomes his mother confessor and his link to getting back together with his wife. She is learning to dance and insists on his helping her with this in exchange for her participation in getting messages to his ex (there is a restraining order that keeps him from her as well as the high school where she teaches). Lost in all this is the seriousness of bipolar disorder. All the people in the movie are in serious trouble, and when the chips are down, the writer and director back off and turn it into a bit of a silly romantic comedy. Cooper is unrecognizable in the second half. Where did all the angst and despair go? These people don't have epiphanies. They are in constant battle with their disease. While it captivated me on one level, I felt it sold out and became less that it could have been.",7
13 April 2020,Fantastic,"A smart, impactful, and surprisingly entertaining narrative, Silver Linings Playbook does more than an impressive job of exploring the live of those with bipolar, and provides a fantastic story along the way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both give fabulous performances as the leads, Pat and Tiffany, as well as Robert De Niro as Pat's father. The film is really entertaining, engaging, and interesting to watch. It can be certainly tough to view at times, but as the world around these characters are broken down and break down in the process, the film does a masterful job of making us want to root for their sides. The film is incredibly clever and well written, and the work of the book can easily be seen upon the screen, and proves to be quite an impressive feat to match. The cinematography is interesting, and honestly provides plenty of shots that i'm sure in the future will be lead to be iconic. The pacing of the film starts off slower than the rest, but this justification, is by all means a great way to start it, and will be firmly enjoyed upon my future viewing. In the end, Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderfully romantic, emotional, and very clever film. It's approach on bipolar is a tour de force, and one of the many reasons that makes this such an important work of cinema. It's entertaining, captivating, and very impactful, and will easily not be an experience I forget anytime soon. My Rating: 10/10",10

25 February 2015,Insincere,"David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is ultimately a disappointing film: an unconvincing portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunction, with a weak romantic comedy subplot and an utterly meaningless second subplot featuring a dance competition. The central characters are not particularly sympathetic either: if they don't convince as mentally ill, they do convince as utterly self-obsessed - the attraction that the two leads supposedly feel for each other is asserted but in no way demonstrated. It's unclear what Russell was trying to do in this movie; but it's not funny, and nothing in it feels like it comes from the heart.

1 November 2012,Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre,"While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.

Written and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.

Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very cliché and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.

The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.

Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichés. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-",8
14 December 2020,Silver Linings Playbook,"The average romantic aspect of the film was excellent, but the dramatic side was poor. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was excellent and she deserved an Academy Award for her performance in the film. Bradley Cooper's performance was excellent. The body of the psychopathic character was excellent.

23 February 2013,"Solid performances but obvious direction and writing rob it of wit, intelligence and depth","Beyond the nominations for Oscars, I hadn't really heard much about this film so I didn't have any preconceptions to speak of and came into it blind more or less. The film focuses on two characters who are each struggling with mental and/or emotional issues that manifest themselves in acting out violently or sexually. The two get together to work on a dance project which appears to help them deal with their issues to a point, however family pressures, emotional pressure, sports pressure and just generally life doesn't just go away.

Given the cast involved and the awards it is up for, the one thing I did expect was for the film to be better than it ultimately turned out to be. It has a certain charm to it but mostly the film disappoints by being so very straightforward and never going really going anywhere dark or deep. Considering the backgrounds (and presents) of the two lead characters, this film is roundly safe and accessible. The mental and emotional struggles of the characters don't seem so bad – just bad enough to justify them as plot devices but never bad enough or real enough to really be an issue that would challenge the viewer or even make them uncomfortable. It isn't that it is comic so much, just that it hasn't got much meat on it. This continues throughout the film before finally it gives up any pretence of being more than just romantic fluff with an ending which does at least represent honesty from the makers – this is the film they were making all along. This is not to say that it is without value – because it is a big film with a lot of talent that is aiming to be accessible entertainment, and it doesn't miss that mark – it is just disappointing that it was aiming for the target generally, not the bullseye.

The cast certainly deserve better than they got, although of course they are generally good enough to make the most of what they have. Cooper isn't someone who appeals to me much but he was solid here. Lawrence will probably get the Oscar here and, whether she deserves it or not, she is pretty good – everything asked of her she delivers which is why it is a shame that the film didn't ask for more. De Niro is enjoyable in his turn while there is decent support from others such as Tucker, Mihok, Stiles and a few others – nothing amazing, but solid. Nobody really shines though – but this is down to the material, not them. Russell as writer and director doesn't seem to have any spark, nothing really going on that stood out for me – it is professional, has some charm but mostly it was workmanlike.

This is how the whole film turns out in fact; it is good in specific moments but it really plays a nice safe line throughout – ignore the subject matter, it may sound dark and interesting but it is nothing of the sort. A safe film that is consistently accessible and easy on its way to a conclusion that is at least honest about the type of film it is – it will charm many with the ending but the majority of the film doesn't charm or challenge, it just ""is"", and I found that to be disappointing.",
10 December 2012,Maybe I am missing something?,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",2

10 March 2015,Underwhelmed,"I think I must have gone into this with unrealistically high expectations after all the foo-fer-all made of it during award season because I came away underwhelmed. Sure the acting is fantastic and if this was meant to be a romantic comedy (?) its a good one, although I don't know how you could classify it as such. It is original in its storytelling though; sad, dark, fresh.

Bradley Cooper gives a great performance as a man just released from a mental institution after 8 months, trying to rebuild his life and win his wife back, or at least get the restraining order removed. Jennifer Lawrence is good too but again I think I was expecting more from her due to the academy award she received.

The ending was kind of meh, that's it? and I'll admit to being bored in sections as well as catching a couple of errors (duct tape appearing and disappearing on shoes). Philadelphia and their team The Eagles play a major role. There's a great supporting cast with Robert DeNiro and a refreshing role from Chris Tucker. 05.13",6
21 October 2012,Sooooooooooo good,"I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.

5 May 2013,This One is a Bad Bet,"Movies about Mental Disorders usually are given a pass by the Public and by Critics. Meaning they are given more latitude than most. That seems to be the case in this overrated Film that starts out quite good but around the second half it becomes unhinged and lapses into a formulaic and very predictable Picture.

There are some good Acting chops and the first part of the Script is humorous and the beginning of the Romantic Relationship is compelling but then something happened. That is nothing happened that was not either outlandish contrivances or painfully predictable. From about the time the Dance rehearsals start it missteps, stumbles and is quite irritating and boring.

The Movie dances around and then forces the ending with some betting gymnastics to the detriment of the subject matter. It relies on the most overused and unexciting Sports finale clichés so everyone can throw up their arms and shout Yea!!! This belongs in another type of pablum known as, we will score just when the clock runs out. Boo!!!

It's hard to imagine this as being sincere about Mental Disorders. More like a handle to grab some cash and awards, pulling the strings and gaining approval for articulating those with handicaps, but here, it all just seems like sleight of hand. There is nothing going on here that deserves any kind of appreciative accolades. In the end it is kind of a cheap shot at the expense of a sensitive, empathetic, and caring Audience.",4

22 January 2014,who thinks this was good? Not me,"After finally watching this over hyped film, I don't get why people think it is really good. I thought it was barely watchable because it was so boring. I don't get all the award nomination nor how Jennifer Lawerence could win an Oscar for this role. There was nothing outstanding about her character, Tiffany, to warrant a stand out role. And the worst part was the lack of chemistry between Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence. First he looks 20 years older than her, and why would a depressed widow want to hook up with a bipolar manic who has melt downs. Simple, it wouldn't happen.

The movie is about released mental patient, Pat, goes home and is obsessed with his estranged wife. He has mental break downs and meats Tiffany whom knows his wife. He agrees to be in a dance contest with her if she will give the wife a letter. And that's the story. Nothing much happens.

FINAL VERDICT: A big waste of time and it certainly wasn't one of the best films of the year. Skip it.",5
26 November 2012,Great Performances Bring Characters to Life,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Excellent performances highlight writer-director David O Russell's story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mentally unstable man who moves back in with his parents (Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver) after being released from a stint in an asylum. Once out he plans on trying to get back with his ex-wife but the restraining orders keeps him from doing so until he meets an equally disturbed young woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK contains some of the best performances you're going to see this year and it's great to see a film that's main focus is acting, writing, story and direction. It seems these things are awful overlooked in today's time but Russell does a very good job building up some extremely likable and believable characters and we got a terrific cast that really brings everything together. I think the main thing that makes this movie so memorable are the performances from Cooper and Lawrence who are simply wonderful. I thought the two of them did a terrific job playing disturbed without falling into any sort of stereotype. Both of them are so believable in their parts but what really caps it is the chemistry they have together. Whether it's romantic, fighting, annoying or just being calm, the two of them really deliver. DeNiro is also very memorable in his supporting bit as the father. I thought this role gave the actor a chance to do both comedy and drama and it's certainly one of his more memorable roles as of late. Weaver, Chris Tucker and Julia Stiles are also good in their supporting parts. Russell offers up a terrific atmosphere of working class Philadelphia just like he did with the setting of Massacusettes in THE FIGHTER. The only thing I'd say working against the film is that it's a tad bit too predictable and it takes a long time getting to where it's going but this here isn't all that bad since we enjoy spending time with the characters.",8
23 October 2012,Most Enjoyable Film of 2012 So Far,"I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all, I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies, it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love, and styles you'll hate, find the ones you click with and never let go.

Silver Linings Playbook has generated a lot of hype since its worldwide premiere at TIFF, and frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it deserves all the praise its received. It is by far the best film I saw at the festival, and is easily one of the most memorable films of 2012. Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, Silver Linings follows the life of Pat (Bradley Cooper) as he moves back into his parents' house after spending months in a mental institution because of a violent outburst that occurred after he found his wife with another man. The movie follows Pat as he attempts to get back his life back, but he meets a new challenge as Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, who is completely girl crush worthy) finds his way into his life.

I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie more from beginning to end. O'Russell brilliantly tells a heartwarming, yet complicated and hilarious tale, that leaves you on the edge of the seat. The cast is wonderful, and all deserving of nominations in the 2012 award season. If people didn't know of Jennifer Lawrence before, they will now. She's quirky, complicated, hilarious, and you really just can't get enough of her. DeNiro also delivers a strong performance as Cooper's Philadelphia Eagle's loving, somewhat OCD father.

If there is one movie worth seeing this year, it's Silver Linings Playbook. The story may follow a family in a very serious situation, but we can all identity with the truth and emotions that comes with struggling through times. It's a story that's easy to connect with, and it's a film that will make you smile from beginning to end. Catch this movie when it comes out in November, and I promise you, you won't regret it.

7 March 2013,"Tiffany and Pat, two volatile people","Watching Silver Linings Playbook tonight I got the feeling that the parts of the film good as they are did not add up to a perfect whole. Still the film has a lot to recommend it. After all it did get eight Oscar nominations from last year including one each in all the acting categories. And an Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress.

Bradley Cooper, nominated for Best Actor plays a husband who just did a stint in a mental hospital for beating the living daylights out of his wife's lover. All three were teachers at the same high school in South Philadelphia and that must have had the faculty and students gossiping for a year.

Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro play Cooper's parents and both were nominated in the Supporting players category for both sexes. Weaver had her son released in her custody without telling DeNiro who accepts the situation for peace at home. He's got his own issues, he's a degenerate gambler who drives Weaver to wit's end.

Some friends try to fix up Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence on the theory that two volatile people could help heal each other. Lawrence's issues stem from the death of her husband a Philadelphia cop. Although there is an attraction for them, both their joint volatility and Cooper's refusal to give up trying to win back his wife are obstacles.

All those things plus DeNiro's gambling habit combine in one interesting climax where the growing relationship of Cooper and Lawrence plus DeNiro's finances are on the line. I dare not say more.

Some nice location cinematography also distinguishes Silver Linings Playbook. Having visited Philadelphia a few times I recognized quite a bit of it. We get to see quite a bit of South Philadelphia where it seems everyone knows everyone and everyone's business.

Both Cooper and Lawrence come across as decent and three dimensional people trying to cope as best they can with mental illness. Lawrence just lights up the screen with her performance. I didn't see the other nominated roles, but they would have had to go some to beat her out for the Oscar and apparently didn't.

My main criticism of an otherwise fine film is that I see no silver linings for either main character. They'll have to do a lot to make the relationship work if they can.

Still Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful film deservedly honored with all those nominations and Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar.",8

17 April 2013,Unbearably dull,"I was expecting to like this film sadly my hopes were dashed pretty early on. The film started badly and just kept on going down and down. This is without doubt one of the most tedious films I have ever seen and I can only congratulate myself on sitting through the whole two hours.

I am struggling to see what this film was trying to be. Drama? Nope there wasn't any. Comedy? Nope not a chuckle to be had. Romance? I suppose you could make a half hearted argument for that one but watching two unlikeable characters fall in love is hardly romantic.

This film was just two hours of inane and boring dialogue. The acting was weak, I find it incredible that the charmless, expressionless and limited Jennifer Lawrence actually won an Oscar for this. Surely one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history. Bradley Cooper was just plain annoying and even Robert De Niro could do nothing to save this turkey although he is by some distance the best thing about this film.

There really is not one aspect of this film I enjoyed and it's rare I can say that about any film. Unbelievably bad.",4
2 October 2018,Zonked Right Out On Life,"Silver Linings Playbook is a touching, moving love story about two damaged people who find love and try to get over their past trauma.

The big plus is that the film is a well acted ensemble piece. The negative is that it is never going to be a true portrayal of mental illness.

We meet Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) when his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) takes him away from a mental health hospital after eight months. The doctors do not think he is ready to be released and initially you think they are correct. Despite Pat's positive outlook he is still affected by the memories of his disintegrating marriage. He found his wife in the shower with her lover who he then beat up. Pat was hospitalised as part of his plea bargain. A certain Stevie Wonder song still sets him off.

His father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) himself has some OCD, he is gambling in order to buy a restaurant. Despite hitting rock bottom, a friend introduces Pat to a widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence.) Tiffany married young and her husband who was a cop died young. She is volatile, depressed and is dealing with her pain by having frequent casual sex. It starts off well with a discussion on various medications they have been prescribed.

Both begin an acerbic relationship, which becomes tender as they practice for a dance contest. Pat still needs to come to terms with his relationship with his ex wife. Pressure mounts as Patrizio has laid a big bet based on the outcome of the dance contest.

Writer/director David O Russell probably knows what it is like to be manic. Actor George Clooney made it known how appalled he was with O Russell's on set behaviour in the film Three Kings. This was not an isolated incident.

The film is a funny, touching, gritty drama. It has comedy and feels heartfelt of people pulling together to help each other out.",7

The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",3
3 February 2020,I was strangely attracted to this film.,"Not only for its ""real life"" romantic comedy with tragedy (like last year's ""The Descendants""), but just the blunt honesty that the film brought to relationships. Turns out: nobody's perfect, but sometimes a ""5"" is a winner.

26 January 2013,Putrid adolescent garbage,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much.

12 May 2013,Great Performances In A Story Of No Great Note,"Bradley Cooper is wonderful. About that there can be no argument. He captured the character and the essence of Pat Solitano perfectly. Solitano is recently released from a psychiatric hospital, suffering bipolar disorder and after having beaten up the man he found in the shower with his wife. Released at the insistence of his mother (Jackie Weaver) and against the advice of doctors, Pat has to try to rebuild his life, coping with a none too normal family of his own (including a mildly OCD Philadelphia Eagles fanatic father, played by Robert De Niro.) His fantasy upon release is to win back his wife, who's taken out a restraining order against him. Attempting to reconnect, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) - a somewhat promiscuous widow who agrees to carry letters between Pat and his wife, who is an acquaintance of hers. Meanwhile, Pat and Tiffany discover a shared love of dance. Pat thinks that doing well in a dance competition will show his wife that he's back to normal. That's the movie is a nutshell. And I have to say that I don't get the hype. It did very little for me.

Yes. It features good performances. Cooper, Weaver, De Niro and Lawrence are all quite good. But they really can't turn the basic story into anything more than what it is - a completely predictable couple of hours that features absolutely no surprise in the end, and that seems far too easily to solve all of Pat and Tiffany's personal challenges. Sure it's mildly humorous at times. Pat going jogging while wearing a garbage bag as a vest made me smile - the first time I saw it. By the 35th time (or whatever) it was just a part of the movie and drew no response.

My biggest beef with this I think was the way it started. There was no real exploration of the character or his past. Yes, that gets revealed as the movie goes on, but somehow I would have liked just a little more of an introduction. Instead, all we got was Pat's mom showing up at the psych hospital and demanding that he be released. I wanted to know a little more about this guy before getting into the rest of the story.

Sure, it has good performances from pretty much everyone. but the basic story disappoints.",3
18 June 2013,Lovely Cute Movie,"Mrs. Dolores Solano (Jacki Weaver) brings her son Pat Solano (Bradley Cooper) back home in Philadelphia from the Karel Psychiatric Facility, in Baltimore. Pat had been interned for almost nine months diagnosed with bipolar disorder after finding his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) cheating on him with her lover in their home.

Pat is still in love with Nikki, but he can not get close to her since she has a restraining order against him. Pat has to go to therapy sessions and he jogs expecting to keep his shape, and his father (Robert De Niro) believes that he is a quitter.

When Pat meets the widow Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds that she is an unbalanced girl. Tiffany and her sister Veronica (Julia Stiles) are close to Nikki and she offers to deliver a letter from Pat to Nikki despite the restraining order. In return, he shall dance with her in a competition in the end of the year. Pat accepts the challenge and gets close to her training for the competition. On the day of the competition, Veronica unexpectedly brings Nikki to the theater, affecting Pat and Tiffany.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a lovely cute movie that won 1 Oscar and was awarded with another 60 wins and 71 nominations. The gorgeous and sexy Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful and deserved the Oscar. The story is original and touching and I really loved this movie that is full of emotions, has great performances and direction, excellent screenplay and adorable characters. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): ""O Lado Bom da Vida"" (""The Good Side of the Life"")",8
5 January 2014,Overrated but fairly typical indie drama,"Over the years, indie films have become, in many ways, as formulaic as the Hollywood blockbusters that are their supposed opposites. Silver Linings Playbook is such a film. It is a standard misfit romance that tries to combine quirk with pathos(as is often the case, its fence straddling between the two means it does neither well), and the ending is pat even by Hollywood standards.

It's also a movie that rings false throughout. This is not mental illness, this is movie-mental illness, in which a set of symptoms are chosen based on what the director wants the characters to do and feel. My social-worker girlfriend said the guy really struck her as more developmentally disabled than mentally ill, and while that would never have occurred to me, I can see her point. He's really more badly behaved than anything else, and it's hard to tell if his main problem is mental illness or just a streak of stupidity. His emotional evolution makes no sense as well; the change is too fast, radical and complete to be considered remotely real, and we don't really see it happening.

Even the dance contest in the end doesn't seem real; it is as though two separate contests are overlapped.

There are good moments in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence, while probably not really deserving of her Oscar, does a nice job of creating someone both tough and emotionally fragile. There are also bad moments, like a surprisingly off-key ""emotional"" scene with De Niro.

There was a time, back in the 1990s, when an indie movie promised something that was in some way different. I miss those days.",6
14 November 2022,Portraying Mental Health,"Silver Linings Playbook is one of the few Hollywood films that discusses mental health. This film came out 10 years ago and it remains one of the few to focus on mental health. Unfortunately, often times mental health is portrayed in a very erratic and impulsive way in films and television and while that is accurate at times, there are a lot of instances in which this can be seen as inaccurate. Since there are few movies around mental health, the erratic behavior which exists in films of those struggling with mental health, has become the expectation for audiences. This movie does have some instances in which the characters struggling with mental health can be viewed as crazy, but I hope that is not what audiences take away from this film, because there is so much more than the scenes where the break. The main characters being able to perform at the recital together is very powerful, because characters like the ones in this movie are usually portrayed as not being able to accomplish anything, and that's not the case. Just because someone has dealt with a mental health issue does not mean that their life is over and that they can't accomplish anything. Mental health can make life difficult, but you can still live your life like anyone else and I think the dance recital is a good example of that. While this film has many comedic scenes, there were some moments that were more sad than funny that audiences laugh at and that is unfortunate, because a lot of people do not understand the struggle of mental health problems. I hope that more films will be willing to talk about mental health moving forward, because it is a very important topic and there is still a lot of work to be done in accurately portraying mental health. Silver Linings Playbook does a very good job in its portrayal, despite how impulsive and erratic the main characters may be at times. Overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it, I would just say that while watching it, think about what the characters are dealing with, and be willing to have an open mind.",10

18 May 2013,Too gimmicky,"The Silver Linings Playbook movie follows a formula, with each character following the same basic development.

Step 1: Characters are neurotic and annoying, creating tension and wearing out the viewer. Step 2: Characters experience an empowering and revealing moment of vulnerability, bringing sympathy to the viewer. Step 3: Characters are supportive and no longer annoying, bringing relief to the viewer.

Every character follows the same routine. It's way too formulaic and gimmicky. The topic of mental illness and the dancing motif also smell like Oscar bait.

17 April 2017,Overrated; boring; unrealistic; too long,"This is a drama film which is misleadingly described as a comedy- drama. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands. It's boring, miserable, too long and not believable.

Jennifer Lawrence was far too young to play her role. Her character - a celibate widow who used to be a slut - is a ridiculous character for someone of her age to play. Count up the total number of widows in their early twenties whom you personally know. Is the answer zero? I thought it would be.

I don't know why Bradley Cooper received praise for his portrayal of a bipolar man. His acting in this film is wooden. He and Lawrence aren't believable as a couple.

There's an unnecessary gambling subplot which isn't in the novel that the film is based on. The subplot adds nothing of value to the film and is merely an unnecessary, tacked-on distraction.",1

3 August 2013,good rom-com with mental illness,"Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) lives with his father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after a stay at a mental hospital. His friend Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker) is also a patient. He is introduced to depressed widower Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who is dealing by having casual sex. He reluctantly agrees to join her in a dance competition.

As a rom-com, it's fun and functional. Cooper and Lawrence are two performers overflowing with charm. As a family drama dealing with mental illness, it doesn't hurt to have De Niro. As a comedy, it's got a few good laughs. What puts it over the top is Jennifer Lawrence. She's electric as soon as she shows up in the movie. She has some great exchanges with Bradley Cooper.

If there is any complaint, it's that there seems to be some missing scenes that's usually needed in rom-com. The movie is already 2hrs long, so I can understand some scenes were trimmed. The deleted scenes section has the necessary bits. Check it out. This is definitely worthy of recommendation.",8
30 November 2012,O no,"Following The Fighter, David O. Russell takes another familiar story and reinvigorates it with a spirit of ensemble chaos. Scenes are stagey and dialogue crackles, and gestures flail and faces grimace, as if everyone's aware the camera is there and they all want to play to it. It's an uncanny dramatic style, one that drags you along for the ride, even when it sits incongruously with the naturalistic aesthetic.

Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer snatched from the asylum by his nervous mother, and brought home to recover in a real madhouse. Pat is obsessed with the idea of rekindling his marriage, the violent break- up of which was the cause of his original breakdown. (We needn't worry about any scary unpredictable outbursts - Pat's much-referred-to anger is strictly regulated by the code of Hollywood morality and comedy.) To do so he enlists the help of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a dirty babe who needs a partner for a Dirty Dancing competition.

Silver Linings Playbook is ostensibly about mental illness, but really it's selling the age-old myth that any emotional dysfunction can be overcome with a Positive Mental Attitude. It does peddle it with vigour: there's real chemistry between Lawrence (more animated than usual) and Cooper (unsubtle but effective); the dialogue has an enjoyable runaway mine-cart quality; and the relationship between Pat Jr and Pat Snr (Robert De Niro, in his best role since Stone) is sometimes affecting.

But however Russell garnishes it, this is a predictable film which betrays its interesting setup by descending into a boring fairy tale. By the time the climactic dance-off comes around, rather than rooting for the meetcute triumph, I was desperate for Russell to claw back some anger or oddness or edginess, rather than following the Nicholas Sparks routefinder to easy soft-focus satisfaction.

It has the look and feel of an Oscar contender (in itself that's neither praise nor condemnation), but it's not clear for what it might win. The performances are decent, without plumbing the depths of those in The Master, while the script is zippy but thematically all over the shop. We'll just have to wait and see what's left after Lincoln sweeps the board.",5
10 January 2013,Doesn't know what to do with itself,"I felt this film was a mess. It starts out promising, with Bradley Cooper's slightly off-kilter gaze proving quite unsettling. You know he's been through a lot, and he knows it, too. We wonder what his next move will be--as does he. In the meantime, he's doing meaningful work with his shrink, who takes his job seriously.

But then he meets The Girl, and the movie slowly morphs into a madcap romantic farce. Goofy parents get involved, the shrink becomes a drinking buddy, and all sense of seriousness vanishes. The scene in Cooper's living room stretches on endlessly as subplot after subplot play out, and drama and comedy are mixed so you don't know how you're supposed to feel about any of it. Is this Rain Man or Abbott and Costello?

The old saw in movies used to be, Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back. Nowadays, it's Boy Gets Girl But Is Too Stupid to Realize It Until She Knocks Some Sense Into His Head. Of course, this rarely happens in real life. Silver Linings has The Girl for a while and then loses her, but neither the writers nor the director were able to get her back.",4

20 January 2013,This is NOT how mental disorders work...,"I was so curious what makes this movie the most awesome rom-com in the entire world that re-defined the genre and whatnot, because this hype avalanche came rushing at me wherever I looked. So I caved and I decided to see it for myself. It wasn't the best idea...

I've dealt with mental disorders in the family and amongst friends, and even myself. I know that doesn't make me an expert and I don't claim to be one. I can only draw from my personal experience with this stuff, and according to that, this is NOT how it works. Not even close. This movie is just using all the correct narrative tools to FOOL you into believing this is how it supposed to work. No, mental disorders, bi-polars, schizophrenia, obsessions, psychotic episodes are NOT quirky or slapstick, and people screaming nonsensical BS at each other is NOT drama. Also, no, you cannot magically cure mental illness by dancing with an equally mentally screwed up girl. That's not how things in life work.

I have to say the acting is first class across the board. No complaints there, it's excellent. That's all the 4 stars up there. I believe the actors did the best they could with the screenplay they've been given. But sadly the screenplay is so far torn from all things realistic, that's what makes it hollow. It has some genuinely good moments, at some places I really saw something shining through, but then it immediately does something so stupid, so predictable, so clichéd, so movie-esque that destroyed all the immersion that's been built up.

I know that's not fair to criticize a movie for not being realistic, because it's a movie, it's not supposed to be, but in this case all the praise I see unleashed on Silver Linings Playbook is about how realistic it is with real emotions and a realistic depiction of mental disorders. No, it isn't! If you want to see a realistic depiction of mental illness, visit a mental ward at a hospital. Don't worry, it's free, you can visit any time you want. Getting in is not the hard part, but getting out...

Long story short, this is an average rom-com movie, with great acting and a good story layout that's been ultimately destroyed by Hollywood clichés. It's certainly not the bestest, awesomest, genre-defining, Oscar hogging masterpiece some people make it out to be. Also, if you haven't dealt with mental disorders in your life, don't believe this is how it looks like, because it doesn't. Thanks for reading.",4
13 January 2013,Another film about mental disorders that CAN make viewers mentally-disordered,"Like The Descendants, this is another film that makes its characters shouts and screaming at each other all the time. But it doesn't work very well. Okay, if the main character has problems that is fine but his family, supposedly normal folks, doesn't look normal to me as they did not realistically try to keep things as low-profile as possible. As if they enjoyed the attention of them being the most annoying family in the neighbourhood. I am not convinced whether the movie is accurate in portraying the realm of clinical psychology, and it made even worse with a cliché and even more unrealistic ending. Maybe I am off-the-mark of what the film is trying to show here, but seems to me everyone (including the dancers which made a remark that I felt was really silly) and even the film itself is kind of dysfunctional and the only person that made realistic sense to me, despite her aggressive behaviour, is Jennifer Lawrence's character.

2 April 2013,"Good Will Hunting Meets Saturday Night Fever, Only It's Not Nearly That Funny","I totally adore Jennifer Lawrence, which is why I went to see this movie, but really I found it very hard to take. Every element thrown into the story looks like it was tested by a Hollywood focus group. The peons love dirty jokes? Check, everyone talks dirty. Everyone loves romance? Check, love blossoms even when the two main characters are obviously insane. The underdogs enter the big contest -- my God, it's a stunning surprise -- and then, well, they come out on top! All those big clichés were bad enough, but I found a lot of minor things annoying too. The condescending view of working class America -- yes, we're all foul-mouthed morons and we all love football, but do we have to paint ourselves green? The condescending portrait of the Hindu psychiatrist -- he's an okay guy once he starts watching football.

It was all so depressing to watch, yet, once Jennifer Lawrence takes hold you become like a mindless slave, unable to stop watching.

Oh, and one word about Bradley Cooper. He's not that bad when he shuts up and the camera just captures something mean and deadly in his eyes. When he's talking, and acting, doing his twitchy little man-boy Adam Sandler impersonation, he's vile beyond words. But when he sits still, you see something harder in his face. Something truer. Suddenly this isn't PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. It's THE English PATIENT. And he's Ralph Fiennes! So really, I give this movie four stars. Two stars for Jennifer Lawrence, and two stars for Bradley Cooper. But the rest of this mess, you can keep.

Oh, and thanks Liberal Hollywood. Thanks for letting the black man play the fool again!",4
5 October 2017,"""...it's a good thing, I'm remaking myself.""","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10
9 October 2012,"Incredible, incredible, incredible!","I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from Pat and Tiffany. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the ""silver lining"" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November.

4 April 2013,Jennifer Lawrence Outstanding In a fantastic movie.,"I've been a great fan of Jennifer Lawrence. I've watched all her movies and always rated her highly. With the exception of The House At The End Of The Street. I think a poor script was more to blame. She is a beautiful and very hot Actress. I first saw a review of her on bustybusts.com and have been hooked ever since. So about the movie....I like movies with a strong story line, this delivers on that score. Bradley Cooper plays a guy who is released from a mental institution and goes to live with his parents. He meets up with Miss Lawrence (Tiffany) and it's kind of a relationship that build only 2 crazy people can develop. I can't say much more than in fear of spoiling it. Just do yourself a favour and watch it. You won't regret it.

5 January 2013,A book with plenty of tricks up its sleeve,"Silver Linings Playbook, by David O. Russell, is one of those movies with a protagonist whom you fervently wish can overcome his demons but whose methods and goals you cannot easily reconcile. The movie is witty, foul-mouthed, very poignant, elegant, and, of course, odd.

Pat (Bradley Cooper, playing way against type) has just been released from an eight-month mental-health-facility. His doctors are reluctant, but his mother (Jacki Weaver) insists he's better and that the place is, well, no place for him. She brings Pat back home to live with her and Pat's father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro), hoping that after eight months Pat will be able to get his life back in order once again.

Pat, though, has other plans. He had been committed to the hospital because he violently beat a fellow teacher whom he had caught in the shower with his wife. Okay, so he snapped - he was lucky that hospital care was all he got. In any event, what he wants to do now is reconcile with his wife and resume his life. Sure, there's a restraining order, which is why he goes to the trouble of reading the books she teaches in her English class, anything to prove he's more mentally fit. Oh, during his stay he loses a lot of weight (apparently), something his then-wife had harped on. (Note: She sounds like a winner to me.)

Things do not go as planned. For one thing, Pat never takes his medication (he's bipolar), which leads to the occasional angry outburst; the song that had been played at his wedding and was played while his wife took her infamous shower is now a trigger for more violent behavior, even when he doesn't hear it. He wants badly to make amends, but he's aiming in the wrong direction, as his ex shows no signs of wishing to see him again.

To help him along, friends Ronnie and Veronica ask Pat over to dinner, and they invite Veronica's iconoclastic sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has social skills that are below even Pat's. The dinner isn't exactly a disaster, but Tiffany leaves abruptly and has Pat walk her home. A kindred friendship is born.

Although the reason for Tiffany's behavior is somewhat important to the plot, I won't mention it here, but somehow she sees something in Pat, something honest, someone she can relate to. Meanwhile, Pat Sr., a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, considers his son to be a lucky charm and practically begs Pat to stay and watch the game with him on Sundays. Pat Sr. desperately wishes to reconnect with his son (there's a recurring theme), but Pat is ambivalent. To cope with his own emotions, he jogs. A lot.

The emotional tug of war, punctuated by the Pat's own inability to control himself (still no meds for him) begins to ebb a little when Tiffany makes him a deal: she'll do something for him (not spoiling) and in exchange he will be her dance partner. You see, Tiffany studies dance as a way to cope with her demons, and there's a gala competition coming up - but one cannot compete without a partner, and she has nobody. Even her parents are wary of her. So that's the deal.

So on the one hand you have Pat Sr. believing his son is a lucky charm and wanting to spend more time with him anyway, and on the other hand you have Tiffany, who offers to help Pat achieve his overall goal if he'll help her. There's a lot of bickering back and forth among everyone; that is, when there's no jogging involved (note: there's plenty).

Okay, enough about the plot; I'll stop before I do give something away. Let's look at the performances. Cooper is exceptional. We've seen him be kind of a jerk in The Hangover and a ladies' man in The A Team, and here he is as a completely conflicted man who desperately wishes to reach a goal for which he's striven for eight months. His is a raw, laid-bare performance.

Lawrence is truly stunning as the somewhat-unstable Tiffany. She's passionate, angry, caring, bitter, sweet, and she possesses even more charisma than she did in The Hunger Games or Winter's Bone. Her jaw- dropping work here is very much deserving of award recognition; Tiffany can be brutal and brittle and still completely endearing. It's the best work Lawrence has done in her short but strong career.

Surprisingly to me, though, the standout in this cast is DeNiro. Now, DeNiro has been sort of phoning it in for a few years now, with the exception (perhaps) of movies like Limitless and Stardust. But here he really shines; it's possibly his best work since at least the 1990s. I've seen tough guys on camera get emotional, and often it just doesn't work. They can't sell it. There's a rare breed of actor who can do the macho angle and the sensitive angle and do it justice, and DeNiro, particularly here, pulls it off. Pat Sr., himself an emotional fellow, is a man full of love and passion and a man who is not without some regrets on how he's raised his kids. DeNiro brings all of that out flawlessly.

Silver Linings Playbook is not a lighthearted movie. It's compelling drama led by a cast composed of relative neophytes and grizzled veterans. It's quirky, just like its director, and it is a clear-cut winner. Here's the best thing I can say about the movie: It feels authentic. When someone is hurt, I feel bad for them; I don't feel that they're staging it. The script is original and idiosyncratic, and every morsel of every scene is one to cherish.",9
18 January 2013,Yuck (spoilers),"I went to see an Oscar nominated comedy. I got a grown man punching his mother in the face with a vicious sweeping elbow and knocking her flat. I got the man's father pushing him down, landing on top of him and beating him with his fists, slapping him and screaming at him. Oh yeah, people in the audience were rolling in the aisles laughing. In every scene there was nothing but tension and conflict. I kept waiting for it to turn around, for the ""good parts"" to show up, but they never did. OK, here's a pleasant break, let's see what happens now. Oh no, this is worse than before. On and on like that.

You want to make a movie about mental illness, fine. You want to bill it as a heartwarming comedy, NOT fine.

I stumbled upon this movie by mistake and chose to watch it because of Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. By the end, I was in tears. This movie (which is an adaptation of the book) is so incredibly emotional as it chronicles the attempt of Cooper's character to manage his life, despite his mental health. Jennifer Lawrence is a welcome addition to the cast in one of her most serious and well-acted roles to date. This film is a must watch of 2012 and will always hold a spot in my library.

27 February 2013,Game Plan,"As a saying goes when the door is shut, god opens a window. Yeah we all had out down points in life, however the truth about life is it's most of the time a matter of how you get back up from troubled circumstances is what counts. This is one of those romance stories I really like because like any plan in football that works it runs toward the goal line.

With any good romance stories and dramas this film has characters that I actually care about and really like. But also really love the quarky, bizarre yet down to earth nature of the film.

The dialog in this film is great, it is at times a little strange and humorous but I feel that's what makes the characters seem more human. It really felt like I was hearing people talking and not just fictional characters.

Pat is played well by Bradley Cooper this is probably my favorite role from him for now. Pat is a broken guy you really feel pathos for. The legal and psychological troubles he's been though, sure what it did isn't completely right, but the guy he beat up wasn't innocent; along with a painful divorce. I like how his aggressive attitude toward things which is not just a psychological problem but a quark. One really funny scene is when he does a rant on a Ernest Heminway book which he literally throws out the window, it's funny because he kinda makes a point. He wants to rejoin life again but the problem is he's calling the wrong play.

I really like how the film at times has some really intense scenes. Like one where Pat was acting out a bit from the fact he couldn't find the wedding video, you can't help but feel for the guy as he has both anger and sadness combined, the fact that the wedding video is gone reflects the life he can't get back because to him that was the only times of happiness. But I really like the humanity of his character, whenever he feels he letting people down whether it's his mom, dad, or Tiffany he feels awful about it and himself; I feel it shows he's not a selfish person he really does care about other people and letting them down is the last thing he wants.

However my favorite character in the film is Tiffany, played brilliantly by Jennifer Laurence whom I think is kinda hot and a more than capable actress. Her character reminds me a little of April Ludgate from ""Parks and Recreation"" whom is also a little similar. I really love how fiery, feisty, energetic, a little bizarre, dark, she has charisma which is black, quarky, or clever. However the best thing about her to me is the fact that she accepts that she's not perfect she has her psychological troubles but she accepts them. She also a character you feel pathos for since like with Pat had to endure a loss, with her though it was the loss of her husband. I like that she's is ambitious in a way, she loves dancing and wants to be a champion but also doesn't want to be alone wants someone in her life again.

You already know in the film both really are a good match for one another. Both are somewhat the same, like with Pat she's also has aggression in an intense scene in the restaurant just seeing her exercise it makes me feel she might be more aggressive than Pat. Both are broken and are trying to get their lives back together as well have more in their life that they haven't had. And the chemistry between them is great I really love the banter between them, there are sparks whether they know it or not, and they support one another in a way; heck both of them dance well together so that ought to say something.

And you want both of them together but not just yet because like with any good romance story I feel one or both have to earn it first. And both do, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film, as the film goes on both characters grow, Pat becomes more of a man and Tiffany more of a woman. And as that happens both start connecting, say things they probably never said to anyone else.

However this I don't think is just a romance about two people but it's also about love for family.

The supporting characters are also really good each with quarks and trouble of their own. Robert De Nero as Pat Sr I thought was great, just like his son he's psychologically troubled. And just like his son has a humanity, really like this one touching moment when he has a talk down with Pat and admits he hasn't been the best father. And we see in the film both of them also start growing closer becoming in touch with one another again.

I've said enough, Silver Linings Playbook is a touchdown.

Rating: 4 stars",10
18 November 2012,Disappointing and irritating,"Critical reaction and user reviews seem to be hugely positive. Let me offer up one dissenting voice. I thought this was virtually unwatchable and would have walked out if I had been seeing it alone. The theme of the film is that most of its characters are mentally ill, or at least damaged, to one extent or another. Unfortunately, this manifests in the form of characters angrily shouting at each other. This extends to about 75% of scenes in the film, at far too great a length, without any wit or craft. None of the major characters is remotely likable. This would be fine if the film was a serious depiction of mental illness. It sits very uncomfortably with a contrived, implausible romcom plot, largely free of originality or surprises. But sadly the romcom element does not extend to more than the occasional funny moment. Jennifer Lawrence is fairly good and the other performances are OK, but the film has nothing else to recommend it. By far the worst film I've seen for over a year.

30 August 2018,One of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen,"Silver Linings Playbook is technically a romantic comedy, but I hesitate to lump it in with all of the other cookie-cutter rom-coms out there. It is one of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen. Plus, it doesn't have that pretentious ""quirky for quirky's sake"" feel that many independent films do. Bradley Cooper is surprisingly good in his role and Jennifer Lawrence is impressive as always. This is an intelligent movie with an entertaining story about broken people who are trying to help each other become whole.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",
16 January 2013,"Terrible movie, expected much more","I really cannot understand what people are thinking and giving it such high ratings. The movie, according to IMDb is supposed to be a Comedy / Drama / Romance movie. Well... forget the Comedy. The jokes are rare and oftenly poor

Drama... Nope, didn't feel that Romance? Don't make me laugh. Cheesy and shallow as well. Does not creep under your skin.

I expected so much more from David Russell especially after ""The Fighter"". I expected so much more from a great cast like this also. DeNiro is OK, I really liked Jacki Weavers performance but I believe Bradley Cooper was a bad casting choice. He is OK for parts like Hangover or the pretty boy in others. I also liked him in Limitless but he could not persuade me at the role of the crazy person. I would prefer another actor in his place, maybe Jack Black (that could actually bring some fun into this so- called-comedy).

I think it does not even deserve a view, just proceed to the next movie choice and leave this one on the shelf",2
21 December 2012,Where was the playbook?,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much.

17 July 2013,Two Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.,"Former teacher Bradley Cooper is let out of a mental institution after having a mental breakdown after discovering his wife (Brea Bee) was having an affair. He tries to handle his bi-polar condition with the help of his parents Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as he moves back in with them and attempts to put his life back on track. His success is hit-and-miss at best and then another potential monkey-wrench is thrown into his life when he meets a young sex-addicted widow (dynamite role by the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence). Together these two very similar, yet very different individuals go on an emotional journey to reclaim normalcy and self-reliance in their lives. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is brilliant in most every way. The performances reach near epic heights with Lawrence leading the talented cast. The film's screenplay is deeper than it appears as it shows subtleties in its characters where you have trouble understanding who has mental deficiencies and who does not. In the end the movie is about humans doing their best, with the help of those around them, to find happiness and success against sometimes grim and seemingly insurmountable odds. In a crazy world, doing one's best in a dance competition and making that little extra money betting on the hometown Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL can become the most unexpected roads to individual happiness and group camaraderie. A definite winner. Kudos to director David O. Russell in keeping what could have been a schizophrenic screenplay (no pun intended) on the straight and narrow path to cinematic success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
20 June 2013,Some great new twists on a familiar against-the-odds romantic comedy,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

A great drama/comedy, both funny and moving, with terrific acting from a terrific cast. What more do you want? Ah, maybe a little more originality, an ending (and a dysfunctional family) that wasn't a twist on ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" something a little less sentimental?

All of these things. And yet, with misgivings intact, the movie is still great in its own way. Part of the reason is some hard, true acting. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are spot on believable, funny, and fleshed out beyond stereotypes. The rest of the cast, including De Niro as the Cooper's father, are simpler characters and yet the types they play don't quite become stereotypes. In fact, the three men (the dad and the two friends) are superb within their roles.

It might be Lawrence who sets the movie on fire most, even above Coopers volatile, yet tightly bound, performance. Lawrence is a kind of freed version of what Cooper must play, and she's more fun, less troubled perhaps, and utterly optimistic. Which brings up the point of the movie.

Beyond the plot of a pair of young people struggling with common forms of mental illness that require medication but allow for fairly normal lives, there is the larger point of rising up, of being positive, or making things happen by wanting to and following through. This is the moving part, the part that makes you love and identify and even envy the main characters as they show how to succeed within their malaise. It really is a common thing to face a mental flaw that brings your life down, or someone you love. And here is how to deal, how to try to deal.

Yes, this is pure Hollywood, without suggesting its happy ending in any detail. It lacks what someone like, say, Cassavetes would attempt in this situation (and the result would fail to reach a larger audience). But it has some brave aspects, making real a situation that needs some understanding without turning it into unmitigated nightmare.

Director and co-writer David O. Russell has a leaning to films that mix high drama and real human and interpersonal concerns. This might be his best film (""Three Kings"" is worth seeing for its mix of serious and comic aspects to war, and ""The Fighter"" has qualities of sadness and persistence that echo here), and it is one that sets his direction as a more serious, interesting Hollywood director. See this.",7

29 December 2015,"Good, but not great","Good, but not great. Well-intentioned, but flawed. Starts off very interestingly and engagingly, with many amusing moments. However, the story becomes more trite and predictable the longer it goes on. Plus, the plot isn't water-tight.

I was expecting something darker and more character-based, rather than light and plot-based.

It's the great performances that lift this movie to above the average. Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar, as did Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver their nominations.

Not as good as I was expecting it to be, but not bad either.

18 November 2012,Should've just tuned in to an Eagles game -,"even if I'm not a football fan. This movie almost convinced me that I would've had a whole lot more fun on my couch with some stove-top popcorn watching some live action touchdowns than I had at the theatre gobsmacked by this menagerie of looney tunes fumbling towards a Hollywood happy ending at any and all cost. Try as I might, felt zero affinity for most of these characters. Though you couldn't find two better looking actors than Bradley Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, their characters were either too aggravatingly loud and/or lame to keep me interested or root for them. In short, I found the characterization of Pat's bipolar disorder and his family's (not to mention his analyst and the policemen's) response to be so benign and simplistic to the point of absurdity and as crafty as she is, I also couldn't bring myself to care for the underdog lovestruck (sex-starved?) Tiffany. I found her character a self-serving desperate ding-a-ling and worse, a predator in pursuit of somebody more vulnerable to fix. While I can appreciate that birds of a feather might flock together, these two do not a happy & balanced love match make, unless you have high hopes for sustainable joy between a codependent manipulator and and an emasculated romantic. Hmmm, on second thought... Anyway, such a shame the movie focused so heavily on these two sad sacks because the rest of the head cases were much more likable. Chris Tucker was a hoot and so were Pat's friends, Veronica and Ronnie. I wish, too, that I could've chuckled a little more because believe that some scenes were meant to really have us rolling in the aisles or smiling subversively... but alas, not so much. (Some of the more funny moments are featured in the trailer and even those weren't gut-busters, right?) Found myself checking my watch, time and again. (And this from someone who applauds many performances by the remarkable cast and does enjoy unconventional romcoms. I'd sooner recommend three other films which didn't garner half the hype but are far and away sharper, funnier, and more original: ""Eagle vs. Shark"", ""Happy Accidents"" and ""The Science of Sleep"".) Now, if this film does manage to make it to the Oscar playbook, it would be deplorable and affirmation anew that in Hollywood - as in life - all that's silver doesn't glitter.",1
10 January 2013,Disappointing,"Started off on fairly interestingly, then devolved into a completely generic rom-com. The idea that true (or passing) love cures mental illness was a joke. (The premise worked better in the far superior A Beautiful Mind, where the main character at least reasoned his way to a more believable kind of sanity and stability, even if that's not really what happened to the real person.)

I do not get all the fuss over this movie. Jennifer Lawrence was good but I was disappointed it had such a pat, Hollywood ending that wrapped up these troubled characters with a big red bow.

Don't believe the hype: This is just standard Hollywood fluff.

14 March 2015,About what you'd expect,"Pat(Cooper, the barely repressed anger of other of his performances) with bipolar disorder is released from psychiatric care and moves back with his parents. He can't get along with anyone, until he meets Tiffany(Lawrence, confident, using sex to avoid her emotions, amazing as usual. Solid chemistry between the two. She alone is worth watching this for. It would be nice if the role wasn't still a manic pixie dream girl), and they can share about each other's issues, and examine their relationships with each other. She offers to help him get back with his ex-wife if he enters a dance competition with her. But will they develop feelings for each other?

I'm told there are differences from the novel, I have not read it. There are themes of dark and light, looking on the bright side. The ending really doesn't work, both as a sort of climax and the note it ends on. It became clear as this progressed that that's where it was going. Still, this does show, somewhat realistically, people who need help, and portray them as human beings. There are jokes about it, and there's drama with it, and they also get to be more than a diagnosis, have things going on that aren't about their issues. This is filmed in an interesting way.

There is a lot of strong language, violence including some bloody, and a bit of sexuality, as well as a little nudity, in this. I recommend this to fans of romantic comedies. 7/10",7
26 June 2013,"Genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene.","I was quite excited for Silver Linings Playbook earlier in the year when it seemed to be the big hit comedy drama like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine and Beginners that I find myself adoring. Then the trailers came and made it look like a messy chick flick shot by an amateur and my expectations plummeted. I had no intentions of even seeing it in the cinema but I'm really glad I did because it fulfilled the big hit comedy and more. What's so special about this simplistic film is that it comes straight from the heart. I've never been too much of a fan of David O. Russell. I Heart Huckabees seemed like a surefire winner for me but it missed the mark. The Fighter and Three Kings were good, but cold. Silver Linings is the film to prove Russell's worth. It's a very special experience that I already want to see again. It's very entertaining and easy to relate to so it cuts straight to the core. Although it is rough around the edges and the third act is a little cluttered, the second act is absolutely wonderful and is enough to make it great.

The most impressive aspect about the film is the intricate production design, with a very delicate and seemingly deliberate use of colour coding for each scene in subtle hues, it's one of its most consistent and interesting aspects as well as cinematic push ins on characters in dramatic moments. The script is what makes the film, fast paced, genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene. It's so great to see Robert De Niro great again after so long. His part is small and to the side and focused on two particular aspects, but it's classic De Niro that has been sorely missed with a few emotional scenes. Bradley Cooper is the real revelation here. I enjoyed him in The Hangover even though I didn't enjoy that film, but here he really emotes and his comedic side is put to best use. He really is deserving of all the acclaim. Jennifer Lawrence is certainly great, but if she were to win the Oscar for this it would probably draw far too much negative attention to being overrated as she was better in Winter's Bone. Easily one of my favourites of the year.

23 January 2013,"Neurotic, crazy, funny, screwball romantic comedy","¨The only way to beat my crazy was by doing something even crazier. Thank you. I love you. I knew it from the moment I saw you. I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. ¨

Silver Linings Playbook is director David O. Russell's second straight Oscar nominated film for Best Picture after the his critically acclaimed The Fighter. This film is very different from his previous work although it also has to do with family relationships in some sort of way. It is based on Matthew Quick's novel of the same name and the screenplay was adapted by Russell himself which resulted in a really quirky but sharp script. There are plenty of hilarious moments in the movie and Russell has really raised the bar for rom-coms by mixing it with some realistic drama. These romantic comedies are very hard to come across these days, but Russell manages to deliver a nearly perfect one thanks to his sensitive direction. He did take a huge risk with this film considering its thematic was a bit tricky since the main character does require some patience and forgiveness from the viewer. He is not a very likable character at the beginning, but if you stick with him and give him a second chance he will win you over. It is not easy to make a romantic film when you have two main characters suffering from bipolar and OCD disorders, and on top of that mix it with comedy, but Russell was very sensitive about the subject. I really love Russell's style of direction, and you either love his movies or hate them. I really found this movie to be easy to connect with as it is a heartwarming and funny story despite the complications and tricky subject matter. Critics are calling this film crazy good, and I agree with them because it is deeply romantic despite being strange and neurotic. Besides we are all a little crazy, and I think Russell was pointing that out through every character in this film.

We are introduced to Pat (Bradley Cooper) in the very first scene of the movie, who is being discharged from a mental institution by his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) against medical advice. Apparently Pat was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after finding his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), having an affair with a fellow co-worker and nearly beating him to death. He was sentenced to be institutionalized for eight months, and after doing so his mother was free to take him back to Philadelphia as long as he live with his parents and stayed away from his wife who had placed a restraining order on him. Pat is received with some surprise by his father, Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), who had no idea he was coming home, but Is happy to have his son back who he considers a lucky charm for the Eagles' games. Pat Sr. is a very superstitious guy and after losing his job he's been making a living through sports gambling. Pat's life changes when he meets another troubled woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has recently become a widow and a sex addict. Pat desperately wants to get back with Nikki and will do what it takes to win her back despite not being able to get near her. Tiffany offers to give Nikki a letter from him if he agrees to enter a dance competition with her for which they will have to rehearse extensively. Both characters suffer several meltdowns and seem to have some sort of shared neuroses, but in some odd way they end up helping one another and struggle together to rebuild their lives.

This film really deserves all the buzz that it received first from TIFF way back in September, and then from its recent eight Oscar nominations, including the big five (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) which hadn't happened since 2004 (Million Dollar Baby), and it also received Oscar nominations in all four acting categories, which hadn't happened since 1981 (Reds). The cast is truly wonderful in this film, everyone gives such great performances. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both expanded their range in this film and went way out of their usual comfort zone creating some unique characters. Lawrence especially surprised me with her quirky performance, and her entrance in the film truly shifts the momentum of the movie. I was really not sold with Silver Lining Playbook until she appeared giving Cooper's character a lot more likability. I loved her in two scenes; the first being the one she has a meltdown in the restaurant and goes off on Cooper and the second being the confrontation she had with Pat Sr. For those two scenes alone, Lawrence could win the Oscar. Cooper, De Niro, and Weaver were all outstanding as well. These characters were all well drawn and the actors took advantage of that delivering solid performances. The film has such a great pacing building the momentum up to the very climactic ballroom dance routine. It was something special. The message had a pretty positive outlook as Russell seemed to be reminding us that we should all look for a partner that can coexist with our craziness and not try to find one that will lead us out of it as we usually do. This was a great and optimistic film that deserves all the buzz it has been receiving.

29 June 2020,Excelsior!,"Funny, romantic (not cheesy) and accurate, a total change of the romance genre adding a philosophical and actually real side of mental illness, Bradley and Jennifer's chemistry is stunning and refreshing while Pat's parents are pure gold for the film.

12 January 2013,The best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! Jennifer Lawrence has never been hotter!,"'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK': Five Stars (Out of Five)

This critical darling and Oscar hopeful just picked up eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and nominations in all four acting categories (which is the first time this feat has been accomplished since 1981's 'RED')! Being a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence (she's my favorite actress and top celebrity crush), as well as the writer/director David O. Russell, I had been very eager to see this film since it went into limited release in mid-November (and even before that after watching the amazing trailers) but it still hasn't come to any cities near me and I had to drive 40 miles to the closest one playing it just to finally see it. I know the studio has been waiting to fully release it so it could build bigger business off of word of mouth and Oscar nominations but the buzz is already here! So I finally saw it in Salem, OR and it was totally worth it. It lived up to my expectations in every way and is my favorite film of 2012!

In the film Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper plays a former teacher, named Pat Solitano, who suffered a mental breakdown after catching his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) cheating on him with a fellow teacher. He spent eight months in a mental institution as part of a plea bargain for beating the man nearly to death. While there he learned that he's bipolar and has been suffering from the disease all of his life. His father, Pat Sr. (Oscar nominee Robert De. Niro), has suffered from violent mental breakdowns and OCD his whole life as well, he's also a sports nut who believes in superstitions that will help his team, The Eagles, win their games. Pat's mom, Dolores (Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver), takes Pat out of the institution when his committed time is done and brings him home to live with her and his father. Pat learns that Nikki left him, sold their house and filed a restraining order against him (out of physical fear) but he's so obsessed with getting her back that he begins stalking her (which is played off as kind of harmless in the film due to Cooper's good looks I think; looks prejudice once again). Then he meets a girl named Tiffany (Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who's never been hotter or more stunning) who's just as down on her luck (her husband recently died) and is almost as crazy as he is. She, like Pat, just lost her job as well due to a recent sex obsession and the fact that she slept with all her co-workers. The two immediately take a liking to each other but Pat fears what this may mean to him and his love for Nikki. Tiffany has been wanting to compete in a dance competition and needs a partner so they both use each other (in a way) as Tiffany agrees to get a message to Nikki for Pat. Things only get more complicated from there. Chris Tucker also co-stars as Pat's buddy from the psychiatric ward. It's his first film appearance since 2007's 'RUSH HOUR 3' and his first non 'RUSH HOUR' film since 1997's 'JACKIE BROWN' (which also co-starred Robert De Niro)! His part is minimal but funny.

The movie is a brilliant character study and the best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! I've had multiple family members suffer from depression and I've experienced it a little myself, as well as other mental issues, so the film was really relatable to me. I also love movies about outsiders and unique individuals who are brave enough to be themselves. Both Pat and Tiffany are brutally honest and not afraid to say what they really feel and like the Pat character says in the movie 'maybe they see things that other people don't'. I was just blown away by the characters and totally involved in what happened to them. All of the performances were outstanding; of course my favorite being Jennifer Lawrence but deservingly so. She's totally beautiful and sexy and maybe too much of a guy's ideal woman in this movie but she's also very confident and self dependent (like almost every character she plays). Her character also has the perfect touch of vulnerability, insecurity and mental instability that really make you feel for her as well. A lot of the biggest A list actresses in Hollywood wanted this role (most notably Angelina Jolie) but Lawrence nabbed it. Partially because she's so popular right now, probably the biggest star in Hollywood (like Julia Roberts in her prime after 'PRETTY WOMAN', and the same age, but about five times as talented) but also because she was the only actress that could play this part that well. Jacki Weaver is amazing too; she says very little but at the same time says so much with just her emotions and facial expressions. You can't not love a mom like the one she plays in this movie. Robet De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and is so complex and interesting that I would have loved to have seen a movie just about his character alone. Bradley Cooper gives by far the best performance of his career (as well as one of the best performances of the year) and is the perfect match for Jennifer Lawrence. Despite their more than fifteen years age difference the two have beautiful chemistry together and that's the driving force behind the whole movie. Of course the film would be nothing without David O. Russell's amazing directing and brilliant script. The man is a genius filmmaker and the movie deserves all the award recognition it's been getting. I'm so passionate about film and the characters depicted in them that when one really moves me it's almost like a religious experience. This is one of those films!

29 January 2013,"Pleasant, decent - but not impressive; apart from the cast, of course","The screenplay has several good moments, incl. strong characters, but, all in all, it is hectic and neurotic, like a movie of Woody Allen without Allen. True, the background allows this, motives are logical, but neuroses and shouting are not very catchy to follow and some laughs I had were connected with psychiatry and related topics. When Pat Jr and Tiffany meet, the following outcomes are fathomable already. The ending is too predictable, even plain.

The cast is great - it is seldom so that 4 actors receive an Academy Award nomination! However, I must admit that male performers seemed more interesting to me - Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro, Chris Tucker, Anupham Kher... Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Julia Stiles etc are less memorable.

I expected more of a comedy, but it was not, really. No hard/bad feelings, but I don't think I will see this movie again in the future.",7
1 August 2019,The real silver lining? The Oscar.,"'Silver Linings Playbook (2012)' is about as conventional as they come in many ways, if not most. Yet, even though director David O. Russell almost exclusively deals in this kind of 'Oscar bait', the film itself never quite seems like solely a soulless awards-grab; it's more concerned with telling a story than showing off its behind-the-scenes talent. While that talent are all, essentially, at the top of their game, it's the relatively unconventional and generally very well-rounded characters that set it apart from its peers. These may be involved in a predictable and slightly baggy plot, but their writing and performances combine to create some really compelling scenes. The entire affair is relatively compelling, actually. It's consistently engaging and, even, entertaining. Its non-condescending focus on mental-health issues is refreshing, too. I suppose, in a certain light, it could be considered adjacent to an indie flick, with a narrative worth exploring regardless of its potential in the awards circuit. Still, it's practically impossible to ignore the fact that it was clearly made for this purpose, especially given that it was only green-lit after Russel proved himself with the similarly successful 'The Fighter (2010)'. That's not necessarily to deprive it of its value, but perhaps to explain why it's ultimately a tad generic. In a way, though, it's a wonder that it's as good as it is, basically being genetically engineered to win awards. The silver lining isn't happiness, it's an Oscar. 7/10",7
2 April 2013,Silver Linings Playbook - A boy-meet-girl tale in modern age,"Finally a cinema-going to officially culminate all the Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee of last year, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK treads upon a traditionally crowd-pleasing boy-meet-girl romantic genre while smartly embodying two main characters with distinguished personal mental foibles, which is a masterstroke to keep them refreshing and connected with the present quirk-emancipated modern generation.

After his ambitious brothers-boxers drama THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), David O. Russell has ascended to the top tier of Hollywood where he can harness marquee stars and meaty source materials, thus, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK has all its edges to be winsome and lovable, but somewhat the final outcome doesn't live up much to the heated expectation, personally I am rather stolid from the American football fanaticism and the ""parley gamble"" bidding is by no means a recommendable action to be encouraged (but it is an intrinsic default in the source novel, O. Russell should not take the blame here I suppose), anyway, the scenario does make wonders to gyrate a captivating duo-dance between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both utterly committed to their characters, verbal ripostes are acetic and sharply accessible. The chemistry sparkles albeit of the age-gap of the actors (a inconceivable 15 years in real life).

Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-crowning has sparked (understandably)

controversies (like most of the years), but it is like the film itself, acceptable (for me), the stretch of her character may be impeded by the condescending male-perspective of winning the right girl, why on earth it always ends with a stale ""it is the girl who lingers on the verge of being hurt"" plot even under the exception of the mighty confidence discharging from Lawrence's character. Her youth is the double-edged sword in this case, thanks to her mature countenance, audience may not detect it instantly, and the film also bypasses to specify her age. So it is a younger example of Helen Hunt's win and looks like a future Jodie Foster career orbit, plus her Kristen Stewart popularity (THE HUNGER GAME franchise will continue lighting her path), she is the ""it girl"" in Hollywood right now and a role model of the industry.

Bradley Cooper, a later-bloomer in his leading man status, has seized an unexpected earlier harvest in Oscar-nomination than most of his contemporaries, although constantly in the danger of being overshadowed by his more sapient co-stars, performance-wise, it is his own victory. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, are not in my top 10 list of the year, since the script doesn't challenge them hard enough, but they do reflect the slice-of-life authenticity of the endearing parents (except that De Niro's weeping scene is too maudlin to endure). And forget about Chris Tucker, I don't know why he pops up here to interrupt his satisfactory (both to him and to me) holed-up.

So, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale full of mentally unstable people with various neuroses, the steady-cam cinematography looks hipster but also impairs one's concentration, the ultimate dance-routine is mesmerizingly shot, but the banal ending does causing a compulsive meh before the credits rolls, although the final speech is fine and (artificially) sincere.",7
14 May 2013,Cinematic Ambien,"When you fall asleep listening to Bradley Cooper ramble on with Jennifer Lawrence about absolutely NOTHING in the middle of this film, wake up 22 minutes later and notice that you missed absolutely NOTHING, it's time to give this piece of junk the review it deserves. I feel this way mostly since we entered into the on-demand contract to watch this drivel on the advice of the Academy and hundreds of delusional viewers who somehow feel this film has something to offer. Silver Linings Playbook is a poorly scripted and marginally acted film. It fails to deliver ANY semblance of anything. The script is horrible, the story is beyond boring, the ""chemistry"" between any of the actors is invisible, if not completely absent, and frankly, I couldn't have cared less how it ended. I think I laughed twice in two hours, that is, when I wasn't snoring. Jennifer Lawrence's apparently Oscar-worthy performance was completely overshadowed by the fact that she said NOTHING for nearly two hours. I mean NOTHING. Between her and Cooper, it was incomprehensible gibberish, and it went on and on like Ahmedinejad at the UN. Just two plus hours of rambling. The mindless, worthless script overshadowed Cooper's apparently reasonable performance as well. DeNiro was the only bright spot, but his performance was forced and he wasn't believable as Cooper's father - not even a resemblance. Bad casting. Wait, Cooper's character might have been adopted - I'm not sure. I might have missed that during my 22 minute snooze. Eh, didn't matter anyways if it were the case. The chemistry there was horrible as well. I can't even give away anything about the film in a spoiler because there's frankly NOTHING TO SPOIL here. I could tell you the ending and it wouldn't mean a thing - you could go ahead and watch away with nothing to look forward to except wishing you'd spent the $6 on a latte at Starbucks or a couple of discount rentals of decent films. Stay away from this film unless you really need some sleep.",1
12 February 2013,Plastic Linings,"To start, I want to know first if this movie is a rom-com, comedy, romance, drama or what!! 'cause I didn't find neither romance nor comedy,actually. I read a lot of positive reviews and heard very good things about it; unconventional romcom, funny, honest,...etc. So, I went with high hopes and expectations to explore this so-called masterpiece.

But what I actually found is it is not only a mere average movie, but also a shallow one with predictable incidents and a dragged clichéd plot. It is too busy; mental illness, sports, book making, dancing, positivity,...etc. Every thing you can imagine is found here, but you will come out with nothing. BY the way, I did not even smile except at a scene or two at most. It is not funny at all. At each scene I waited for the next hopping to enjoy the fun, but I was hugely disappointed.

Even for the soundtracks, I think Danny Elfman has done better before.

I am always moved by movies about dysfunctionality-mentally or physically- but this time I really disliked the characters; a man who hit his parents, a sex addict, a gambler father. What is more laughable is that these characters are supposed to be inspirational!

I can't explain till now why all that hype around it, perhaps for Bradely Cooper who was the only savior out of all that mess, and Jennifer Lawrence who's already loved by the audience. Even those two I felt the chemistry between them is lacking. Every one of them did well but each on his own, away from each other. Or perhaps people were tricked by the the hype and media to the extent that they laugh at nothing.

Truly speaking, it is unfair to rate it 1/10, but I did so just to lower its general rating on IMDb as it's much more unfair to rate this awful movie 8.1/10

Hope I watched LIFE OF PI once again instead of wasting my time and money on this thing",1
18 January 2013,Typical Hollywood cliché,"I give this movie a generous 7/10 only because it handled the issue of bi- polar disorder quite well and the performances were solid. However, other than that, this movie was nothing special.

Typical Hollywood cliché. Predictable all the way through, relatively uninteresting script, extremely cliché finale. SLP had heaps of potential. It was good, but could have been MUCH better!

I feel I might be pessimistic, but the run at the Oscars this year with the Best Picture Nominees has been disappointing, with not a single film giving me that amazing special feeling I have gotten in the past. Only Amour and Zero Dark Thirty await my viewing. I hope they're better than the average quality of film presented in the past year.

16 July 2020,A Poignant Rom-Com,"I finished this film and read a touching review submitted by a man long suffering from bipolar disorder. As a pharmacy graduate it is a mental illness I have studied and reflecting on this reviewers honest insight I believe Silver Linings Playbook serves as an incredible portrayal of the lifestyle and personality of an individual afflicted with manic bipolar disorder. Bradley Cooper carries the lead role extremely well - I actually believe it is his career best performance - and his chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence is what the success of the production cruxes on.

I would best describe Silver Linings Playbook as a poignant rom-com, and credit must be given to the director and the whole cast for pulling off such a genre bending feat so successfully. There were just a few things about this film that I didn't get, which ultimately has lowered my rating somewhat. I don't get why Pat (Cooper) was so hung up on his ex wife the whole film if he decided he was in love with Tiffany (Lawrence) the night he met her. The heavy American football theme throughout was a miss - it was actually the least interesting angle of the movie, and I usually always enjoy themes of sports in films. It just felt like a little bit of a distraction from the main story and the relationship unfolding between the two lead characters.

The viewer is led to believe that Silver Linings Playbook closes with a happy ending, but I'm not so naive to believe that two people suffering from quite serious mental health issues will constitute a stable relationship. We want the best for Pat, but I felt more grief than joy at the end as I don't believe Tiffany is the most sensible suitor for him in this moment in time. As the final credits roll, I sensed there is a lot more turmoil ahead for Pat and his family.

Regardless, Silver Linings Playbook is another hit from director David O. Russel. If I could, I'd give it a 7.5/10.",7
29 March 2013,Formulaic Waste,"I'm shocked at the number of glowing reviews this movie has. It was merely another formulaic, predictable rom-com with lazy writing.

It started off great, with the potential to be edgy and insightful, and throw some genuine light on mental illness. The first half hour or so contained some great scenes, with a good performance from the two leads, sharp dialogue and some decent commentary on bipolar. But halfway through, it lost all of its wit and vision, abandoning it to descend into yet another unrealistic by-the-numbers rom-com.

If that's all you're looking for, then fine. But I was lured into watching it after being misled into thinking that it would be something more. Very disappointing.

12 October 2018,One For Your Heart,"Fine little movie that combines very skilled elements of comedy, romance and drama, with some quiet moments and some feel-good moments, and yes, an end that is ""kitsch"", but as long as kitsch is well executed I don't mind.

Another plus: Silver Linings Playbook got an overall great cast with obviously a lot of fun playing their roles and the script provides us here and where with some unique moments/ideas and also shows the other side of the coin of having psychological/mental issues - not everyone affected by a mental illness is a depressed loner or a lunatic psychopath, but some got refreshing different behaviors from what is considered to be ""normal"" and their behavior is an invitation to rethink our own behavioral routines and structures.

Good.

12 January 2013,Life doesn't work like that!,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5
12 July 2017,Best chick-flick!,"I am not a fan of chick-flicks... as a matter of fact I avoid them at all costs, but saw this in exchange for my girl agreeing to see one of my action films.

I have to say, I was impressed! Director David O. Russell did an excellent job keeping the viewer interested all along, but the main reason this film kept me wanting more, were the performances and chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I don't think any other actors would have kept my interest. Add Robert De Niro into this mix, and you have a winner!

It's a well deserved 8/10 from me!

27 June 2018,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!,"I love this movie. It is one of my favorites and I have seen it so many times, I can't count anymore. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence portray people with mental illness and stress so well. They have great chemistry and they're both nice to look at too! haha. I can't get enough of this movie! Not really a family-friendly movie, but definitely worth a watch for adults! I would recommend to everyone :D

15 November 2020,"Not a Rom-Com, Just A Beautiful Motion Picture.","I don't understand why I'm seeing such a pervasive rom-com label attached to this film. This is a fallacy. In reality, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film of captivating emotional depth with a spot on depiction of bipolar disorder and stigmas within mental health. The acting across the board was sensational from Robert Deniro's best supporting actor nomination to the breathtaking performances of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. In my opinion, Bradley deserved the Oscar alongside Jennifer's but nontheless, Silver Linings Playbook is one of my personal favorites. A true gem of gems.

17 January 2019,Finally An Emotionally Gripping Mental Health Drama,"2 December 2012. Certainly not a Hemingway movie. Finally a full feature film with mental health as its central core that captures the visceral and authentic impact of mental illness without the cliques, stereotypes. At it is for the fact that director/writer David O. Russell avoids these pitfalls that allows the real captivating and emotive vibrancy of the this family and relational drama come alive. Such movies don't need the extra baggage of sweeping epic dramatization as The Sound of Music (1965) and occult horror special effects Constantine (2005) or unusual circumstances as Fly Away Home (1996) or The Wrestler (2008) to create fascinating characters and situations from fantasy and instead can follow a well-written script to make its emotive impact as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or even the more unlikely intensity surrounding Elizabethtown (2005) or A History of Violence (2005) or the exotic foreign look into Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Helen (2009) opened the door to mental illness as a decent movie drama sub-genre by itself following up with the authentic human drama found in Margot at the Wedding (2007). Silver Lining Playbook is a penetrating look at the behind the close doors and sometimes not so closed doors of real life disputes, family conflict without resort to hyper-drama disconnected with most lives in America or around the world as A Beautiful Mind (2001), The Fisher King (1991), or He Was a Quiet Man (2007). Even a relatively common as unemployment and poverty might be as depicted in Seven Pounds (2008) or even more closely aligned in topical matter to The Soloist (2008) dealing with schizophrenia, Silver Lining Playbook focuses on our family or a family that we likely know.

Silver Lining Playbook stands out from even Girl, Interrupted (1999) for its more accessible look into a family that that most in America can relate to in the family room, bedroom, in public streets, a cafe instead of hidden away residential facilities. Unlike Lars and the Real Girl (2007), the humor in this movie is in part based on our own uncomfortable feelings that are touched so much closer to home, a laughter based on the intensity of mental illness and the embarrassment that we might feel if we actually acknowledged the tragedy that periodically occurs in this movie, like slapstick comedy of the silent movie era. Much like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) made everyday things such a dog into a horror creature, Silver Lining Playbook allows its audience to take everyday life and begin to understand how any of our lives or those around us can be so easily touched by mental illness or the polite facades and idiosyncrasies we all surround ourselves with.

Silver Lining Playbook might be more closely compared to a more upbeat Little Miss Sunshine (2006)or the more artistic and polished American Beauty (2000) or the contemporary plight of economic recession on family man in Up In The Air (2009) or the more straight forward dance movie of Shall We Dance (1996 and 2004) or a raw dramatic look at family life of the 1950s of The Tree of Life (2011), the darker A Day of Wine and Rose (1962) which presented a stark and tragic look at alcoholism.

Except for the ending, Silver Lining Playbook represents a significant and daring family drama presentation of mental illness, though perhaps in the tone of Pat from the movie, this definitely isn't Hemingway and thus makes it the perfect movie, if wants to throw Hemingway out the window.",10
9 December 2012,Look for the silver lining,"Author James Redfield said, ""The challenge is to find the silver lining in every event, no matter how negative,"" but, as French author George Bernanos has pointed out, ""one can encounter optimism everywhere – even at the bottom of a bottle."" He said, however, that ""hope is a risk that must be run. It is the risk of all risks"" David O. Russell invites us to take that risk in his offbeat comedy Silver Linings Playbook and it pays off. Based on the 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, the film tells the story of two people who struggle to help each other out of the emotional hole they have dug for themselves and, like David and Lisa and the recent Rust and Bone, demonstrates that the affection people have for each other can begin to break through the limitations caused by their distress.

Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher, is an optimist who looks for the silver linings in life, believing that things happen for a reason. His motto ""excelsior"" does not, however, lead him ""ever upward,"" (except when he takes too many meds) but he believes that it helps him to maintain an even keel. Having just been released from a Baltimore psychiatric facility where he was diagnosed as bipolar, partially as a result of a violent incident involving his wife Nikki (Brea Bee), Pat tells his family, mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and father Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) that he is ""solid,"" but as Bernanos has stated, ""a health bulletin is only worth something if it is signed by a doctor, not by the patient."" Pat's tendency to emotional outbursts surfaces again in the office of his therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) when he hears the song that was played at his wedding, a so-called test by his doctor to gauge the limits of his control which, as the incident reveals is low to non-existent. Not that there is any connection, of course, but his father is no stranger to inappropriate displays of emotion, having been banned from attending home games of the pro-football Philadelphia Eagles because of his violence at the stadium in support of his team. Dad, who is now a bookie, (generally illegal in the United States), has the idea that father-son bonding involves having his son watch football games with him at home every Sunday, but it never seems to work out quite as planned.

When Pat bursts into his parent's room at 4:00 a.m. ranting about the failure of Ernest Hemingway's novel, A Farewell to Arms, to provide the reader with a happy ending, flinging the book through a bedroom window, it tends to reinforce the idea in his parent's mind that he is not as solid as he thinks. Pat wants very much to reunite with his wife Nikki, but there is only one problem – she has taken out a restraining order against him which kind of mucks up his plans. He remains unyielding about this, however, even after he is introduced to and establishes a connection with the much younger Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence in an Oscar-worthy performance.

Though Pat maintains his distance, it is apparent that Tiffany is looking for more than friendship in the relationship. A comrade-in-arms in the mental health department, she has been depressed since her husband was killed in an auto accident and has attempted to compensate by engaging in gratuitous sex in her place of work. Reaching out in friendship, Tiffany agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki in exchange for his agreeing to be her partner in a dance contest, an agreement she does everything in her power to enforce, leading to unforeseen consequences. Backed by a terrific soundtrack that includes music by Alabama Shakes, alt-J, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Rare Earth, and Stevie Wonder, Silver Linings Playbook works because it is funny, genuine, and emotionally satisfying. Though there may be some clichéd moments, it's relatively easy to find the silver lining.",9
8 January 2014,Very good movie starring the lovely Bradley Cooper,"Silver Linings Playbook is a novel based on the same name and tells the story of a young man named Pat (played by Bradley Cooper from the Hangover) who suffers from Bipolar Disorder and is released from the Mental ward along with his friend(played by Rush Hour's Chris Tucker) who wasn't suppose to come out at all yet as they both bailed out. Pat lives with his mother and father(played by Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver)and he is very optimistic that his wife will reconcile with him as she left him,and his job got the sack along with everything else he had. But one night when Pat is invited to a party in another friend of his house who is married(played by Julia Stiles from Save The Last Dance),he meets a bad-mouthed cynical young woman named Tiffany(played by Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawerence) who's husband died in a freak accident and she's got a lot of problems to deal with since his death.

They both make a deal that if Pat helps Tiffany with the dance rehearsals she will help him get back with his wife by giving him a letter, but did Pat's wife really sent that letter to him and how will his relationship with Tiffany(who he later falls for in the movie)get on?

Overall this Oscar Winning movie is very good as it was my first time last night to watch it as I got the DVD of it and quite frankly i think Bradley Cooper SHOULD have won an Oscar for his performance as the mentally young man who swears,and throws tantrums like a child and whenever he hears a certain song it triggers him and he loses his temper whenever he hears it playing. Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the slightly delusional young woman who has a bad temper and a foul mouth.

Overall it was a good movie and if you love Bradley Cooper than check it out.

Final rating its a 8.",8
29 August 2018,Watch for the signs,"Pat Solantano Jr. (played by Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper) is just getting out of the mental hospital; he was in there for beating the man that his wife was cheating on him with. He comes home to live with his parents, go to therapy and to find the silver lining in things. Eventually he meets Tiffany (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence), who has her own problems. He forms a connection with her and she even offers to help him get a letter to his wife, and in exchange he helps her with a dance competition. Pat Sr. (played by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro) and Dolores (played by Academy Award Nominee Jacki Weaver) are Pat's parents and Pat's father is somewhat OCD; he likes his remotes a certain way, he doesn't want anybody in his study and he believes that his son is the positive juju that the Eagles need to win the Super Bowl. The question is: Can Pat Jr. find the signs? Or will life get him down?

This is a great movie, plain and simple. The editing and writing of this film is top notch. David O. Russell is at the top of his game with this film and he earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for both writing and directing the film. Whether you agree with his directing style or not, it is clear that he loves these characters and, in spite of all their faults and differences, he makes them all likable in many ways. Kudos to Russell for pulling off such an amazing feat!

But let's face it: the real stars are the stars themselves in this movie. Let's start out with our main character. Cooper is a revelation in this role. This was the role that got him out of his comfort zone - the comedy zone - and into the world of versatile acting. He is now known for his supreme acting chops and he knows how to make it work in a drama. He knows how to create characters that can be crazy but in a good way. Definitely deserving of the Oscar Nomination. With Jennifer Lawrence, while I can't say that she deserved the Oscar (it should have went to Emmanuelle Riva for Amour), I can say that this is the best she's ever been. She is on the top of her game in this role and it is clearly a role that she loved to play. Her and Bradley Cooper went on to star in two more David O. Russell films - American Hustle and Joy - and it is very clear that they love working with each other; you can practically feel the chemistry that these two share. She definitely at least deserved the nomination.

But let's talk about the supporting characters. Robert De Niro is a prime example of ""when you grow older, you start getting the grandpa roles in crappy movies."" While the dude can act, it's no question that he is in a slump. It's this movie, however, that showed that he's still got it and that he is not going away anytime soon. This is the guy who won awards for being a younger version of Marlon Brando and for boxing other guys in a ring. It's good to see that guy again; definitely deserving of the nomination. But the person who I believe should have actually won in their category was Jacki Weaver for her performance in this movie. She is the Mom who is worried sick about her son because he was in a mental hospital and she just wants him to be a part of the family. She is amazing in this role and she also gives the best performance of her career!

Needless to say, a great movie! What more can I say?",8
16 February 2013,"Seriously?? Can this win an Oscar??... Oh, I see, the Weinsteins are behind it","First of all, as I always do when I write a review in IMDb, I'll state clearly again my astonishment with the rating. I insist: looks like something's wickedly wrong with IMDb...

Now for the movie. Well, it's not horrible. It's watchable. But the strings show everywhere. With this I mean that to anyone with film knowledge, it's a PRODUCT. A product crafted with the Oscars in view, like everything the Weinsteins do. They sometimes make it good (""The King's Speech"", ""Shakespeare in Love""), sometimes they make it awful (""The Master"", ""Django Unchained""). This is kind of midway.

Why do I say the strings show? Well, for anyone that has read a couple of basic screen writing manuals, it shows. It definitely shows. The script is so by-the-book that that's the only reason for the absurd second halve of the movie, the it's-so-stupid-it's-unbelievable double bet thing. I won't get much into it for spoilers reason, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Not to speak about the whole dance nonsense or even the possibility itself that such a bet could ever take place with at least one non-retarded adult witness involved. And the ending with all the characters gathered in the same physical place for no other reason than to fulfill one of the more hackneyed writer's Bible Commands??

In the good side (the silver linings side?) the idea of displaying a drama involving characters with mental disorders we don't know much about helps us to care more about the real cases outside the movie. Only that I read somewhere among the users reviews that such illnesses are not faithfully displayed. And that's bad. Makes me wonder if the bipolar disorder wasn't really what interested the director- screenwriter, but only the possible awards (we know very well by now that Academy voters love mental illness in a drama).

Which leads me to David O. Russell. Like Paul Thomas Anderson, his work starts to show the egotistic perversion of a self-acclaimed ""artist"". I've commented how flawed the script is. The direction is worse. It's mediocre. His pseudo-documentary- style moving camera only makes me dizzy.

I insist, it's a watchable movie. But Oscar-worthy???",2
23 December 2013,David O'Russell Delivers another great film,"Led by director David O Russell (The Fighter), and delivered by great performances from the Oscar Nominated leads (Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro), Silver Linings Playbook works brilliants.

The film skates over issues of mental illness, only starts to get going with the belated introduction of Jennifer Lawrence (about 25 minutes in), and ultimately follows a relatively conventional rom-com flightpath. But there are times when it does something new with the genre — and it does make you care about the protagonists.

As great as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief in his brief role.

Why the film works besides the directing is the story. It is fascinating seeing Cooper act as a mental patient wondering his way through his everyday life, as well as Jennifer Lawrence playing a mysterious browser. Silvers Lining Playbook is disguised as a rom- com but it is much more than your typical Hollywood fare. You are rooting for the characters in the end, as even though it may be somewhat predictable, the way it all unfolds is worth the watch. ==================================================================== ====== As for a rewatch (07/04/17') Silver Linings Playbook is more fun and entertaining on another viewer. There is more clues and little hints and as an overall watch it really becomes a much better feel to the film. The performances and chemistry of the leads are what set this film apart making it magical. One of David O'Russell's best films.",9

18 November 2012,"""Like"" this Playbook!","Call me crazy, deranged, maniacal (why not, everybody else does), or whatever you like, but there is no doubt in my complex mind that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A 21st Century Masterpiece! Writer-Director David O. Russell has orchestrated a divine, genuine flick about a Philly ""born and bred"" 30ish man who has been released from a mental institution who returns to live with his parents and also battles his bipolar disorder. The man I am referring to is Pat, who was put in the mental institution due to almost beating to death the man who his wife was having an affair with. Pat is still obsessed with his wife and stands pat in focusing on getting her back. Pat's parents are Pat Sr. and Dolores. Pat Sr. cares about his son dearly, but his main bird it seems is the obsession he has with the NFL Football team The Philadelphia Eagles. Dolores is your typical loving mom who primarily cares about comforting and smothering her offsprings. Pat gets introduced with Tiffany, a vivacious Philly gal who also has some mental challenges of her own and is still trying to cope with the death of her husband. The silver lining here is that this brilliant film becomes a utopia odyssey on dealing with broken pasts and adjusting to novice changes. Pat dismisses Tiffany mucho times due to his obsession on reconciling with his wife; but when Tiffany asks Pat to be his partner in a dance competition, the playbook is up and running on how their life readjusts with those moves. Writer-Director David O. Russell's masterpiece works on all levels due to his skillful integration of family, psychology, obsession, regret, love, and so many more authentic aspects of the film that perfects its craftsmanship. Russell's script is on the playbook as the best of the year with so many unforgettable verbiage; and is there a better written-scene in a movie this year when Tiffany is explaining to Pat Sr. that his son Pat Jr. is really a good-luck charm to the Eagles when Pat Jr. spends time with her. Bradley Cooper's starring performance as Pat Jr. is the best of his career, and should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar; and no I am not hungover. Even without speaking in tongues, Cooper's gaze expresses so much about his character's condition. Jennifer Lawrence has just catapulted as my favorite young actress working today with her exceptional performance as Tiffany. Robert DeNiro is back baby! Yes, I am talking to you! His lively performance as Pat. Sr. is vintage DeNiro and is line for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Jacki Weaver showed that her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for ""Animal Kingdom"" was no fluke, and is in the kingdom of exemplary thespian talent. It was also great to see Chris Tucker return to form with his charismatic supporting performance as Pat's friend from the mental institution. The game plan for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was executed to the max, and hopefully is in line for many Oscar nominations. So get your entertainment playbook in gear, and schedule a visit to the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". ***** Excellent",10
26 December 2013,"Beautifully acted, but difficult to believe","This is the kind of film that the Academy love and regularly shower with awards come Oscar season. Silver Linings Playbook is a story of love triumphing over mental illness that sees excellent performances across the board, but, as is the norm with these types of films, the 'serious' subject matter glosses over the cracks in the story's believability, and the happy ending rather waters down the seriousness of bipolar disorder, resulting in a somewhat insulting message that love can somehow cure mental illness. But David O. Russell, the former indie pioneer who's now a regular Oscar-botherer, is a good director, and with it's many flaws aside, Silver Linings is a funny, quite moving picture.

After being released early from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper), a man brimming with anger and who has bipolar disorder, tries to win back the wife that has taken a restraining order out on him. He has a new positive outlook on life, but is still quick to anger, throwing a book through a window because he doesn't like the ending. His parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) try to support him but find it difficult to cope. He meets the equally unstable Tiffany (the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence), and the two make a deal. She will get a letter to his wife as long as he becomes her dance partner in an upcoming contest.

Russell's back catalogue shows his unique eye for comedy. I Heart Huckabees (2004) was a bizarre existential comedy full of oddball characters that really worked, and Three Kings (1999), his breakthrough, managed to squeeze many laughs out of a war-torn setting. Silver Linings Playbook is more comedy than drama, but the laughs are few and far between. De Niro is the real comic relief in the movie, but his OCD, Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father isn't believable. In fact, the whole family setting asks a lot of the audience. For a film so seemingly grounded in reality (it takes the washed-out, shaky camera approach), the supporting characters just aren't real.

It works best when its two leads are together. The movie really depends on the chemistry between Pat and Tiffany, and they do sparkle in their scenes. It's rare that a movie makes me want characters to get together, but in the moments when they dance, you can feel the connection, and you want Pat to forget his estranged wife and open his eyes to what's in front of him. Cooper brings a likability to a occasionally despicable character, but Lawrence steals the film. Tiffany is a force of nature, damaged by the death of her husband and now finds herself labelled a slut after many a one-night stand. With Lawrence at the helm, it's impossible not to fall in love with her.

The rom-com clichés are followed very much to the T, with eccentric minor characters that somehow all end up in the same place at the end, the will-they-or-won't-they climax, but it does them well. It also avoids any real upsets in Pat and Tiffany's journey, instead opting for a much more light-hearted, easy-going approach. But, like Pat says, isn't their enough f*****g misery in the world already? Maybe he's right, but I feel the movie took an easy path opposed to a more serious study of the effects of mental illness.

15 January 2013,Brilliant!,"Adapted from the novel of the same name by Matthew Quick, David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a Brilliant film in all respects. Marvelously written, prolifically directed & astonishing acted, here's a near classic!

'Silver Linings Playbook' Synopsis: After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.

'Silver Linings Playbook' defines Great Cinema. Russell's Screenplay is marvelous. Here's a story that is realistic, funny & extremely believable. The characters are real, their situations are real & their decisions are real. Russell's Direction is prolific, he handles this comedy-drama like a pro. He outdoes himself in here. A Special Mention for the wonderful Cinematography by the talented Masanobu Takayanagi.

Performance-Wise: Bradley Cooper leads the film with a tour-de-force performance. Cooper sinks his teeth into the character & is magnificent from start to end. Jennifer Lawrence is one hell of a performer & her performance in here proves that fact right, yet again. Bob De Niro is terrific, enacting the supporting player with panache. Jacki Weaver is lovable. Chris Tucker & Anupam Kher are fantastic, while Julia Stiles is natural to the core.

On the whole, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is so good, it can go down in Cinema History. Two Big Thumbs Up!",10
1 January 2013,One boring un-surprising movie,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",1
4 September 2018,Psychological treat on how two incomplete's triumph!,"Tone, Script & Story: Pat and Tiffany are two people who have lost something in their life when psychological terms are concerned. Now Pat is trying to find his previous life back while widowed tiffany wants somebody in life to make it going. Things happen and they end up with each other as the movie ends. They find silver lining despite their condition via each other. What actually happens? I don't want to be spoiler to that. Please watch the movie.

I have witnessed bipolar disorder and the way it is filmed here makes me believe other psychological factors in the movie are pictured as well too.

Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is best work from David O. Russell in my conscience. It appears quite accurate. Acting: Goes well with direction.

Final Verdict: It is psychological treat on how two imperfect built something perfect. It is worth adding to your collection.",9
16 August 2020,"One of the great ""romantic comedies.""","For a while, Silver Linings Playbook presents itself as more or less a conventional, somewhat predictable genre film. By the second half, however, as the plot develops and deeper complexities are revealed, it approaches greatness.

There's a great symmetry and subtlety to the film: loose ends are tied up quietly and without fanfare, and events are mirrored like the rhymes in a great poem. ""Playbook"" is darkly hilarious, well-written, warm without ever becoming over-sweet, brilliantly acted (why doesn't Robert De Niro take more roles of this caliber?), and beautifully shot. The lighting alone is masterful in many shots and sequences.

Silver Linings is in many ways as paradoxical as its main characters. It is at once formulaic, simple, and obvious, and yet also reserved, subdued, even coy in its tendency to let the viewer connect dots and fill in subplots and backstory for himself. Even in the most ridiculous and far-fetched of scenes, like the argument and negotiations of the parlay bet near the film's climax, there is a stunning reality and believability to the characters (due in no small part to the inspired chemistry of De Niro, Lawrence, and Cooper).

Like its two main characters, the movie is at times loud, obnoxious, and in-your-face. And yet it's elegantly constructed, with a careful eye for nearly subconscious detail, both in imagery and plot. It is easily one of the best films of 2012.",9
13 April 2020,Beautiful,"Beautiful movie that help with trough my day I had a terrible argument with my mother. My hole day was in peases I felt like emptyness I was. BUT this movie patched my me up filled that void in me I settled my aurgument with my mother. Movies are something special to me they make me feel stuff that isn't there otherwise.

12 December 2018,"intimate, offbeat, and thoroughly engaging","Excelsior! Having spent several months in a psychiatric hospital, a recently divorced man suffering from bi-polar disorder is released to live with his overbearing parents in a suburb of West Philadelphia-not exactly an ideal scenario given his unpredictable behavior and attempt to get his act together. While his mother tries to get him back on the right track and his father desires to make up for lost time by bonding through Eagles football, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship with an unorthodox young woman (recently widowed) who's just as messed up as he is. Like you'd expect the film has a foregone conclusion, but focusing on two lead characters who are totally screwed up creates more entertainment by sidestepping the typical elements of the genre. Moody, poignant, and unconventional, with colorful dialogue and important themes like family and friendship are all displayed by Russell's skillful direction that effectively captures the shifting moods of his mercurial characters. Cooper is appropriately brooding and neurotic, Lawrence perfectly feisty and acerbic, but the acting is superb all-around. ***

21 February 2013,Good movies have been made about mental illness; this isn't one of them.,"David O. Russell has always appeared to me to be the fourth member of a quartet of directors, roughly contemporaneous, who include Paul T. Anderson, Wes Anderson, and Alexander Payne. I would say that, of the four, he has always been the weakest. The only one of his films I truly enjoyed was ""Three Kings"". With this effort, I think he may have slid a little bit farther down in my estimation. He did manage to get good performances out of his cast, but when that cast includes Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Jennifer Lawrence, that should be a given. As for the film itself, it was kind of a mess, really. It just seemed interminable, with a whole cast of irritating people acting in dramatically implausible ways. The most sympathetic character, for me, was Tiffany, but I suspect that had more to do with Jennifer Lawrence's performance than anything that was written into the part. I hope she gets the Oscar that she earned for ""Winter's Bone"", and I hope a worthier role comes her way in the near future.

5 December 2015,Jennifer Lawrence excels in a decent romantic-drama,"Based on a novel by Matthew Quick David O. Russell's adaptation of The Silver Linings Playbook was one of the big awards contenders during the 2012/13 awards season, being the first film since Reds to be nominated for all four acting awards at the Academy Awards.

Patrizo ""Pat"" Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is a man who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and been sent to a mental health hospital for eight months after finding out his wife was cheating on him. Pat is released in the care of his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), but he is still of the brief that he just needs to better himself and he will get back with wife, despite the fact she has a restraining order against him. Pat live soon changes when he meets a young woman who also has mental health issues, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman that could be his route back his wife. But Tiffany is a damaged woman and wants something in return, a dance partner.

Jennifer Lawrence won an Academy Award for her performance and it was deserved award. She totally convinces as Tiffany, a forthright personality who has a lot of demons. The role was clearly meant to be for a slightly older actress, but it goes to show how talented Lawrence is by selling the role. Both as a character and as an actress she dominates the screen, whether she has to take command or when she has an episode.

The rest of the cast also give excellent performances, something you expect considering the talent involved. Cooper and De Niro are both top actors and are excellent as the father and son, both with issues, Cooper managing with a condition while avoiding using drugs and De Niro having some OCD tendencies, hinting that Pat's condition may run in the family. One of the big scenes in the film was when the family argue after an incident and Tiffany coming and controlling the situation. This trio of Lawrence, Cooper and De Niro obviously enjoy working with Russell because they end up working together again in American Hustle and Joy. Even Chris Tucker is tolerable in his role as Pat's best friend.

Despite the praise the film has received Silver Lining Playbook has a very standard story arc, that Pat wants to get back with his wife, but want he needs is to move on. It is clear from the start she's not interested in getting back together and from what we find out about her Pat just idolises her. The screenplay is also very episodic, a series of challenges Pat has to face: accepting he needs to take his pill, taking Tiffany out on date, learning to dance, face a big dilemma and perform in a final competition. There was a slight sports movie template. There are subplots looking at the Pat's relationship with his father, how American Football is key to their relationship, yet has a poisonous effect on Pat, getting him banned from the stadium for fighting and his passion and superstitions lead to him foolhardy decisions.

Silver Linings Playbook has been described as a comedy and it does have some witty lines and comedy interactions, but it is really a drama. It is not humorous enough to be a full on comedy. Props does have to be given to Russell's direction, giving us little hints of the family's life through the set dressing. It gives us hints of the wider discord within the family. But the dialogue in the film does feel overwritten and unnatural, being more focused on being profound then grounded or realistic which would have been more appropriate.

Silver Linings Playbook is a showcase for it acting talent and Russell does an excellent job in the director's chair. But it's billing as a comedy-drama is a little misleading and its scripting is very standard affair.",6
20 January 2013,Silver Linings Playbook,"Over the past several years we seem to have several romantic comedies coming out each year. Most of them do not interest me one bit and I stay away from them. I am sure you know which ones I mean. The ones that are predictable and despite all odds a handsome leading man ends up with his beautiful female leading lady and the chemistry does not feel real and it all feels so contrived and clichéd and it's one of those situations where if you have seen one of them, you have seen them all. Thankfully, Silver Linings Playbook is an exception to that rule. It is a film that is more, or less a romantic comedy, but also deals with mental illness and real people and their feelings. The film at times would indeed make me laugh, but at other times I sat in quiet amazement over the wonderful performances that were on display here from the whole cast and also the top notch writing that brings us deeper into these characters and provides for much entertainment and brilliant dialogue. I know some people were a little concerned about having a film where the two main characters have both suffered from and still do to an extent, mental health issues. However, I did not find that the film put that element in there to mock, or single out these characters, but instead to show a different perspective on every day life and in this case different views on love and relationships as well. When you are first watching Silver Linings Playbook, for the first half hour, or so, you really do not know which way this film is going to go, or what type of a film that it will be, but I was pleasantly surprised on all accounts. Both stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are terrific in this. I have only seen Bradley Cooper in The Hangover, before this and while it was humorous and entertaining, I think we all have to admit that it is not an awards calibre movie. Bradley Cooper shines in this role and gives us so much to walk away from the film thinking about as does Jennifer Lawrence as well. This is the first film I have seen Jennifer Lawrence in and she was also terrific. There is a certain element of mystery and a sense of uncertainty about her character as you watch the film. She seems to have put up barricades around herself, probably to protect her, but as the film goes along and she lets down those walls and you get to see more of her character and look past her insecurities and neuroses, you really do start cheering for her and hoping it will all work out for her as well as Bradley Cooper's character as well. It has been awhile where I have seen a comedy drama with such well layered and developed characters as they are here. They felt real to me and because of that, I could often identify with them, feel for them and feel a certain connection to them. Every minute of screen time they had, I just wanted to continue to watch them over sheer fascination of these characters and because of how well written and how well played they were. Supporting actors Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver do a great job here as well and to be perfectly honest about it, I think this is one of De Niro's strongest films and performances in years. Silver Linings Playbook often brought a smile to my face, gave me something to think about and at times almost brought tears to my eyes because of the sheer simplicity of it's characters and the beautiful relationships they have developed with one another and how they just don't give up when things get tough, or throw in the towel, so to speak, but they actually go and want to better themselves and improve their lives and get over the stigma and stereotypes of mental illness and prove that they can make it on their own and achieve what they want to achieve. This film was really special for me. It made me laugh, almost cry, allowed me to identify with the characters and lifted my mood watching the film. It put me in such a good mood that I wanted to stand up and cheer after the film was over. What a monumental piece of filmmaking where everything seemed to have gone perfectly. This alongside with The Master, are my favourite films to date of 2012. I see big things ahead for Lawrence and Cooper and David O. Russell is proving what a great screenwriter and director he is after this and The Fighter. Congruatulations to you all, you were all fantastic and did a great job.",10

9 February 2014,"A Bi-Polar Review: Loved the characters, Not so much the Plot","I loved Bradley Cooper's Pat and Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany. As two unconventional souls, living arrested lives, they deliver powerhouse performances.

In fact, all the characters really shine in a way that was honest, crazy, sexy. Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro were pitch perfect as the parents. The family dynamics - the humor, the conflict - were so authentic, I believed I was watching a real family in real time.

I just found a disconnect between the slightly contrived rom-com conventions used to structure the movie - the Dirty Dancing-type competition and the ball game bet.

For me, I would've loved the plot to be as loose, crazy and unpredictable as Pat and Tiffany. They were the silver linings in the story.

2 March 2013,"A Different Kind of a Romcom with Quirkily Effective, Seriocomic Touches","Portraying mental illness on screen usually means you'll see bravura scenes set in an asylum like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", but iconoclastic filmmaker David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on the same-name 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy, ""Flirting with Disaster"", as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.

As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.

Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of the Fockers franchise. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver (""Animal Kingdom"") effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles. As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker (""Rush Hour"") is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles (""Mona Lisa Smile"") shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status- conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.",8
31 December 2012,Story too close to home!,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5
19 June 2019,The real life:: Silver Linings Playbook,"If I had seen this movie within a month when I got discharged from the rehab I would have definitely said this movie is just insane and nothing happens like that no one behaves like he does...etcetera _. But now after a few months , when I watched it I should definitely say it was just the same or no way that one could explain it better than the way it is done in this.

If you have ever been admitted in a rehab it's yours. If you have any one of your family member who has gone through a rehab you can relate it to those situations or if you had any friend turned maniac and put inside there you too can understand a bit. If you have no idea how it will be the life after you turn insane and your life after the the rehab and how the society will see you after all these ...,there is no other movie which can show you better..

No matter what. If you watch it there is no doubt that you become a hardcore fan of Bradley Cooper cos he has not just acted or lived in the movie he had done something more than just words could explain.

2 January 2013,"More like platinum instead of silver, a real treasure","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is, at present, in a mental institution in Baltimore. He lost it, you see, when he came home from work and found his wife in the shower with another man. After beating the heck out of the male cheater, Pat's wife also has a restraining order out on him. Nevertheless, Pat is convinced that he is going to get his ""ex"" back and without medication for his obvious bipolar condition. After 8 months of therapy, Pat's mother (Jackie Weaver) does get permission to take her son home to Philadelphia. Problems continue, however. Pat's father (Robert De Niro) has his own anger issues and is running an illegal business out of his home. Dad doesn't understand his own son's situation very well and doesn't have much patience. Especially when Pat Jr., reading a book, gets so upset he throws it out a window, breaking the glass. Meanwhile, some longtime friends (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) decide to throw a dinner party and invite Pat and the wife's young widowed sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). If it is an attempt at matchmaking, it doesn't go well. Yet, slowly, Pat and Tiff do become friends, even to the point of swapping impossible requests for each other. Tiff wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition while Pat wants the beautiful widow to get a letter to his ex, even though its against the law. As Pat Sr. places a large bet on the dance exhibition and his beloved football team, the Eagles, the stakes are high, especially for the mental health of Pat and Tiffany. Will there be a silver lining for all? This beautiful, touching movie should be rated in platinum, as its value is more than silver or gold. Its serious issues are mixed with humor and sweetness, making for a very enjoyable view. Then, too, the direction and editing are spectacular, offering many imaginative changes of scene. Above all, the performances are amazing. Cooper displays great talent in his role as the complex Pat while Lawrence acts years beyond her tender age to shine as Tiffany. De Niro, Weaver, Stiles, Ortiz, and the rest of the supporting cast are mighty nice, too. Kudos, especially, should go to Chris Tucker for his fine turn as a fellow mental patient of Pat's. The scenery in and around Philly is both lovely and gritty while costumes, make-up and photography are very worthy, too. Yes, the finale is a bit too pat while there is some bad language thrown about, too. But, all in all, get in line soon to buy tickets for Silver Linings. It is one of the finest flicks of the brand new year.",9
19 January 2014,I do this! Time after time after time! I do all this shite for other people! And then I wake up and I'm empty! I have nothing!,"Pat (Bradley Cooper) is Bipolar. It is evident in his constant manic state. I never see the deep depression that accompanies the diagnosis, so maybe he is just manic. Unfortunately, he is off his meds, and trying to solve the problem on his own. Really stupid. He is so deluded that it is not even funny. Is this supposed to be a comedy?

He attends sessions with a therapist (Anupam Kher), but it is a waste of time due to the fact that he is not taking his meds. So, how long is it going to be before he is back in the hospital or jail?

In comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the best part about this movie. She may be a little crazy, but she is doing the best thing possible for Pat. She has him committed and focused. I think it is a little unrealistic, but there is a point where he does say he is back on his meds, so maybe it was just the script.

His parents, Pat Sr. and Dolores (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), show that the apple doesn't really fall far from the tree. They do support him in their crazy was, as does his friends.

Lawrence was fantastic, and Julia Stiles was like icing on the cake.",8
15 January 2013,This film is well done,"Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best preformed films of the year. Bradley Cooper plays against his usual ""man whore, with a heart of gold"" routine and gives his best performance ever as Patrick, a man recently diagnosed as bi-polar. Cooper is effortlessly captures moments of humor and only to turn to anger or sorrow in the next minute. Jennifer Lawrence in the perfect compliment to Cooper playing a recent widow turned sex addict. Lawrence took what could have been a flat character and was able to make a dramatic and moving performance that shows her acting skills; being able to transform from totalitarian fighting teen in the Hunger Games franchise. Cooper and Lawrence drive the film through their chemistry, every moment they share on screen is magnetic.

The supporting cast is also fantastic. De Niro gives his best performance in years as Patrick's football fanatic father. Much like Lawrence, De Niro is able to make his character grow, even with limited screen time. He also draws a surprising sympathy from the audience despite his unlikeability. Jacki Weaver should not go unmentioned. Her sociopathic character in Animal Kingdom was the black horse of the Oscar's in 2010. Weaver makes due with a small role that would go unnoticed with any other actress.

Overall O'Russel makes has the perfect balance of comedy and uneasiness that should be in a drama. He adds romance without making it the main focus, a triumph for a genre usually clouded with clichés. The script should be in the runnings for award shows this season, as it deftly handles the reality of mental illness without losing it's heart along the way.

Silver linings is in my top ten this year, check it out while its still in theatres.",9

2 March 2013,Magic In Silver Lining,"Silver Linings Playbook might be beyond than just a romantic comedy. It is probably also a verisimilitude about people with bipolar disorders and families falling apart. It may offer more to the story, but despite all, it still centers to the romance than anything else. It's not groundbreaking to the genre, though it doesn't have to. For some reason, it sort of feels quite refreshing. The film is compellingly and genuinely charming. It has a lot of memorable performances. It can be predictable at times but it's easy to ignore those by the film's merits. Silver Linings Playbook is easily one of the best recent romcoms we get.

It did not start out as a romantic comedy, though. The film begins as a drama about a guy struggling with his condition and longs to win back his ex-wife. The whole romcom formula only appears when it introduces the connections between the two leads. Some points can be typical, but they are thankfully not noticeable because of its clever storytelling and writing. The film's humor, like any romantic comedies, aims to be awkward, but their delivery is pretty natural instead of hamming up. In most romcoms, the screen couple aren't usually appealing. The biggest reason is because their romance always ends up being empty, unlike here their love leads to something. They rather express their honest mistakes, but when they don't, they just share their sweet side to each other.

Apart from the romantic comedy is a drama comedy that deals with Pat's complicated life and family by his serious condition. It is suppose to be both funny and affecting but it never ignores the darkness of their problems. Just like David O. Russell's recent films, he manages to keep it heartfelt and utterly entertaining. The performances also carries the film. Bradley Cooper has always been charming in his romantic roles but here gets to do more like bursting his character's expressions by his mental illness and he's quite convincing at doing it. Same thing goes to Jennifer Lawrence. Well they are both amazing, leading a remarkable chemistry. Robert De Niro is, without a doubt, terrific that this could be one of his memorable recent performances.

It's a simple fun love story about two people sharing their same life problems, or maybe not simple. It is both light and dark but in a less serious way. They go crazy, fall in love, and talk about ridiculous ""superstitions"", but that's what makes it so likable. We could forgive its minor flaws. This is a rare romantic comedy that isn't exasperating, artificial, and hollow. It is awkwardly hilarious, and has genuine love and charm that we needed in the genre. It finds something wonderful in the end. This film is a silver lining to this becoming stale genre.",9
4 November 2019,The role of a liftetime for JLaw,"Jennifer Lawrence has limited acting capabilities. Her face is just too stiff. BUT having said that, this movie summarizes all the best she can do in one. It is so hard NOT to love and feel for her at the end of the movie. So that Oscar is actually well deserved, but she will never get another one, or be of such value in any other movie. It is THIS ONE role that does it (with great supporting cast).

25 September 2020,"""That's Not Just Tinsil""","Great watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend.

This is a great movie that I don't care about. I'm not a particularly big fan of either Bradley Cooper or Jennifer Lawrence, though they are clearly great actors, and give a fantastic performance in this, especially with the range of emotions delivered and broad spectrum of dialogue topics.

It's about two sad, broken people who are trying to rehabilitate and release back into society despite their behavioral problems. While that is intriguing from a psychological perspective, I found it to be more sad than fun, which does make it powerful and worthy of awards and your attention, but it's not a movie that I'm going to re-watch lovingly.

The writing is excellent: well structured and has good content, with an odd message that it is okay to lie to people when it is in their best interest so that you can get them to a potential to better themselves even if choose not too, and that is what love is.

The movie also focuses a fair bit on proper etiquette of social interactions, football, and dancing: none of which I'm particularly fond of watching.

So while there isn't a lot for me in this, objectively, I do believe that a lot of people will like this and it is well worth a watch.",8

10 March 2013,"If you like stupidity, watch this!","What a terrible boring movie is this! No romance en certainly no comedy! Long and pretend to be deep dialogs, shouting and screaming, retarded behavior, unrealistic situations, nagging, problems and nobody comes up with a normal solution. A drama! After 40 minutes I stopped looking. An hour later, still the same screaming and stuff!

And then it suddenly turns in to a dance movie? I guess the lady's will like these scenes, but it's just not consistent. And the black man is teaching them how to move? Come on!

The story is simple. There's a crazy guy who has serious problems. He's still living with his crazy parents, in this town full of crazy people. Then he meets this girl, who is ... crazy, of course. And then they become crazy in love. Whow! What a story!

Of course, at the end, it all becomes sentimental. But the screaming never stops. Even when someone is whispering, it sounds loud!

I can't believe this film scores an 8 on IMDb. I give it a 4 for the beautiful colors and Jennifer Lawrence, and that is quite high! Brrrrr!",3
13 June 2020,This movie might just give you bipolar...,"Dont worry, its just clickbait, but if you often find yourself to be one with characters from movies this is something for you. The events do line up a litle to perfect for my liking. This takes away from the life like feeling, which in my opinion was the best part of the Silver Linings Playbook, but the characters are very true to life - until the ending, i find it a little to strong. This movie is somewhat subtle, and i would love to see more of it. Thats my only complaint, i loved the movie, and i think its definitely worth your time.

24 February 2018,Offensive portrayal of mental illness,"The actors didn't even try to accurately portray mental illness, let alone with any kind of nuance or sensitivity. The result is offensive. The two leads are as bland as they always are. I'll never understand why Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar. She has the acting skills of a plank of wood.

The movie is character driven; it's about a mentally ill person who is trying to come to terms with people he believes he hurt while at the same time trying to accept the fact that he is mentally ill. The movie deals with issues of noncompliance with medications, resistance to treatment, parent-child issues, marital discord, domestic violence, and personal redemption. Jennifer Lawrence is endearing as a vulnerable young woman who masks her vulnerability with bravado. Robert DeNiro is great as Bradley Cooper's father. His character has issues too, which is why this movie is so wonderful: everybody in the movie has issues, and isn't that what life is about - dealing with issues? The movie generates few laughs because it's story is too serious, too down to earth and too realistic. After all, what is so funny about somebody being released from a mental hospital? One other point: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in the dance scene are wonderful. Two endearing characters that the audience can root for, this makes for a wonderful movie. And if the plot is contrived, so what? It's a movie, and it's about people dealing with issues. Mental illness is debilitating and the recovery process can be rocky. The movie dramatizes that without becoming corny. Bradley Cooper deserves all the recognition he may receive for a strong acting performance of a complex character. After watching this movie one can leave the theater feeling not only entertained but sensitized to the needs of the mentally ill. After all, Pat can be anyone of us, and what happens to him can become anyone's story. Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s; they have replaced George and Martha and Oliver and Barbara as icons for the dysfunctional couple and for this reason: Pat and Tiffany ring true; their relationship is strained yet passionate without being theatrical. The mother signing out her son; the father struggling to connect with his son; a young woman who feels cheated by life; and a man who is coming to terms with his own vulnerability all make for an excellent movie.",10
17 February 2013,"Near-brilliant mixture of personal journey, family dynamics, and romance...a cinematic gift","Director David O. Russell also adapted this winning screenplay from Matthew Quick's novel about a young man from Philadelphia at a crossroads in his life; just out of a mental institution and living with his parents, he's determined to reconcile with his estranged wife while staying off medication and keeping a new, positive outlook in order to rebuild his world. Mercurial, chatty, funny, intimately-felt and acted comedy-drama could well be Russell's most commercial enterprise yet, though one which still contains enough prickly edges to make the shifts in tone both wonderfully erratic and unpredictable. The opening scenes are broadly drawn, however the characters are a likable group, and Russell does a terrific job at sweeping the audience up into this amusing and volatile scenario (with recognizable dialogue and behavior reverberating throughout). The cast is uniformly excellent, and Russell (as both director and writer) never drops the ball, keeping his pace lively right down to the wire. ***1/2 from ****

31 December 2013,eye-opening and entertaining expose of mental illness,"Generally, this film is a romantic drama, confronting mental issues sympathetically and with some humour but keeping the poignancy of the subject. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the stars and rule the screen together with great chemistry and physicality. Robert de Niro was also (unsurprisingly) brilliant, depicting Pat (Cooper's) father - suffering with some mental issues himself and creating an unstable environment for a young man with vulnerability having just come out of a mental hospital. Jennifer Lawrence, also amazed by her acting skill; great range, as did Cooper. Portraying someone with bipolar or erratic behaviours is difficult to change posture and expression on the drop of a coin and these two actors did very well.

The story is complex, gripping, nerve-wracking and quite complex. The story isn't spelled out and is revealed in the narrative and through the occasional flash backs. The scenes are a little choppy, certainly at first, but this probably is a technique to speed up the opening part of the film. The cinematography is plainly shot, with no surprises, and I think that it could have used some more artistic styles or variation. The language in the film was quite bad, given that I was watching with someone who was sensitive to that, but it wasn't entirely unnecessary in that it fit with the characters and the narrative. The story itself took in mental illness, love, disappointment, familial dysfunction, gambling issues, bereavement and is wonderful, uplifting and very interesting but sometimes worrying and uncomfortable to watch.

I can see why this got lots of awards, including Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar, given the range of the actors and the complexity of their characters. Whilst it was brilliant, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but will certainly vouch for how good it is! A fantastic character led drama with a touching love theme.",7
28 January 2013,So What?,"So I just watched Silver Linings Playbook and thought ""So what?"" I had heard great things about this movie, namely that it had received 8 Oscar nominations. So, I thought, this has to be a great film? Great cast, great director, a recipe for perfection, right? Well, if this movie was a cake, someone forgot to add the yeast, because this sucker did not rise. We start with a very likable Bradley Cooper, who just seemed to be 'acting' too much in this movie. I know that sounds strange, but actors are supposed to draw you in to their performances, make you feel like you could know them on a personal level, like they could live next door. But this just felt like I was watching a performance; albeit a decent performance, by Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence stars as his love interest and also gives an adequate performance, but that being said, I expected so much more. Without giving too much away, Bradley stars as a man who has got some problems, tries to rectify them, and find himself and love along the way. The feel-good movie of the year? Probably! But not for me. The movie seemed clichéd and derivative. Robert DeNiro is a wonderful actor and a legend in his own right, but a Best Supporting Actor nomination? I just don't get it. What I think makes me dislike the movie even more is knowing the other films it beat out for nominations. Movie like Django Unchained and Argo for Best Director. These 2 films were wonderfully directed and the movies themselves are accomplishments in directing! Big casts, different locations, etc. I felt like I could have directed Silver Linings. For some reason, I got a whiff of Jerry Maguire from this movie: a man trying to rebuild himself, and finding love along the way in the most unlikely (yet most likely) of places. Only, Jerry Maguire was a wonderful film. It had depth and sincerity and still stands as Tom Cruise's finest performance. To say that this felt ""phoned in"" is an understatement. Was this a good movie? Ya, OK, I watched it and didn't turn it off. But, is that saying much?",5
13 December 2012,"Humble, emotional, hurtful, and touching it proves that damaged hearts have a chance at love!","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of those films that you could classify as a drama, love story, sports film or raw comedy and true the picture has all those mixtures. Still it's one film that's filled with emotion that when one watches they will like. And be like me just don't watch the film because your a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, because the picture has so much to offer in the form of a love chance and a second discovery of peace and life for two hurt young people. Based on a true story then done as a book the direction on the screen is near perfect from David Russell. Anyway set in Philadelphia, PA you have Pat Solitano(in a breakout role for Bradley Cooper)an ex school teacher who's just recently left a mental ward after being treated for bi polar disorder and it's clear he probably has no chance with his ex wife. So Pat returns home to his parents mom the laid back and soft spoken Dolores(Jacki Weaver)is still with dad that's the rough and hard nose fight you in your face Philadelphia Eagles fan Pat Sr.(in one of Rob De Niro's better roles in awhile)so is this all that Pat junior has to look forward to bleeding green on Sundays and trying to read literature. Well just when you think the expected the unexpected happens Pat meets a beautiful yet troubled still outspoken and brash young lady in Tiffany(in a mature and fine performance from Jennifer Lawrence). And along the way some relationship chemistry develops slowly but surely as it proves trust can develop between two wounded hearts with some time. Really enough words can't describe this film as one needs to watch it to feel the full emotions. It proves that damaged hearts that meet have a chance for love as time, work, and compassion can heal a damaged mind proving with anybody that love in the book can cure all as two troubled people together who love one another can produce a silver lining in the end.",9
26 September 2013,Every cloud.....,"It's frustrating you know, watching a film where two people who are clearly meant for each other struggle to discover that conclusion for themselves. They argue, fight and do all they can to avoid the inevitable... to no avail. Of course it does help when the pair are likable enough for us to root for them, and here Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence have an instant rapport, and we love them as much as they eventually will one another. In another time-honoured movie tradition, both are borderline crazy, and yet seem to be so much wiser and perceptive than their other, supposedly sane family and friends. They might lose their temper for no reason and cause scenes in public places, but at least they're not afraid of speaking their minds and have firm plans in motion.

Oh yes, the 'plan'. This is what the movies boils down to... the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Think positively about everything, and refuse to let doubt get in the way of your goal. Good luck with THAT. If this film proves anything, it's that the unexpected always get in your way... and if you think life is just a straight highway to your destination, you're in shock. And just like reality, the dialogue here is rich with emotion and humour... these characters jump off the page and become full functioning human beings we care about. During the final act when everything is at stake, if you're not on the edge of your seat cheering them on, check your pulse... you may be dead. A lovely movie. 7/10",7
24 March 2021,I couldn't stand it,"For a while, it seemed like Silver Linings Playbook was going to be the next The Notebook, the quirky romance that stole everyone's heart and started instant conversations and friendships. I went to see it in the theaters before the Academy Awards, and I hated it so much I almost walked out. I should have insisted, though; the entire movie was filmed with a shaky, handheld camera and my mom was so dizzy, she staggered out of the theater and nearly passed out. Needless to say, I don't think highly of David O. Russell's directing style.

I also don't think highly of the movie. Bradley Cooper plays a mentally disturbed man trying to function in society. He's spent time in a sanitarium and has now been released to the custody of his parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver. His horrific social skills and damaged brain may endear him to some viewers, but I couldn't stand him. If I met someone like him in real life, I would smell the red flags immediately and never get together with him again. Why does Jennifer Lawrence attempt a friendship and romance with him? Because she also has mental problems; but when she finally explains her sorrow, it makes you want to laugh rather than pity and understand her.

This movie is only for the fans of extremely quirky and dysfunctional. Do you enjoy ad lib fights with family members, where people shout at the top of their lungs for no reason? Do you find a space cadet mother figure whose catchphrase is, ""I made homemades,"" and is emotionally useless, endearing? Will you root for a couple with such appalling social skills it would be a miracle if they made it through a five-minute conversation with anyone without causing offense? Do you think it's good acting to go ""against type"" just for the sake of going ""against type""? Then you'll love this movie. The only part of the movie I was able to appreciate was Julia Stiles's performance. She plays Jennifer's sister, and she has a realistic, subtle delivery to her lines. It must have taken guts to act alongside a new teen star with a similar look, and she had to do it.

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie is not be your friend. The entire movie is filmed with a handheld camera, and that will make you very sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",1
19 March 2014,Ten minutes was enough,"I have no patience with movies that present unlikeable, irritating, screeching boors like the character Bradley Cooper plays. Complaining about a Hemingway novel. Getting violent in therapy because he simply cannot STAND a song. Naturally this is played like Jack Nicholson's ""epic"" abuse of a waitress in Five Easy Pieces--wow, standing up against the psychiatric bigshots, aren't you a Rebel Boy. Naturally, the psychiatrists and other patients are played as dullards simply because they aren't as Speshul as Bradley.

After I had to listen to De Niro and another actor do a clichéd-stuffed discussion of which sports team is best (translation: Bobby Picks Up A Check), followed by Cooper trashing an office and being completely ignorant aboutHemingway, I switched off the DVD player. This one is a stinker all around.

31 January 2013,Overrated,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",1
9 December 2012,Jennifer Lawrence Shines In Top Drawer Romantic Comedy,"Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful modern romantic comedy from director/screenwriter David O. Russell. The cast is excellent especially Jennifer Lawrence whose work here could earn her an Academy Award nomination. Bradley Cooper is a former teacher recently released from a mental institution after being sentenced for a violent outburst. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder he is determined to pick up his life where he left off and that includes reuniting with his wife. He isn't at all prepared for Lawrence a mentally conflicted widow living in her parents' garage. Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver are Cooper's football addicted dad and June Cleaver-like mom eager to help their son get his life on track. I found the characters totally believable with a nice blend of comedy and drama ultimately leading to a thrilling climax. Chris Tucker is terrific in a small role as Cooper's friend from the institution.

5 October 2012,A Definite Must See,"Went to the Mill Valley Film Festival Opening tonight and viewed the film. Bradley Cooper spoke to the audience before the film started. The movie was fantastic. Such a great inspiring film for all. It makes me want to be a better person--for SURE!! Great story line. So passionate, reaches deep into the soul of family, friends, marriage, love, compassion, understanding of others, how we question ourselves and others. Wow, walked away just wanting to see it again. Robert DiNiro played a stunning role as did Bradley Cooper. It reminded me so much of home in WNY and family values. So much of what we forget about love, family and stopping to listen and see the signs. A must see for sure.

15 November 2018,A happily-ever-after story....... kinda!,"Disturbingly fast-paced, and as heart-warming as it is hilarious. Telling us a happily-ever-after story but with dysfunctional protagonists, David O. Russell gave us a completely refreshing addition to the Rom-com genre. With an intelligent that walks a very risky thematic line, and terrific performances and spellbinding chemistry between the two leads, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while.

Every once in a while the movie seriously suffers while juggling disparate tones, but that what was expected anyway. Also, David O. Russell did his best keeping the balance.

6 March 2021,"Silver Linings Playbook has an original story in a worn out genre, David O. Russell have created a masterpiece in this genre","Silver Linings Playbook is a comedy-drama, written and directed by David O. Russell. The film is based on Matthew Quick's 2008 novel The Silver Linings Playbook. Bradley Cooper plays a man with bipolar disorder who gets released from a psychiatric hospital, and gets to move back in with his parents. He is then determined to win back his estranged wife, but things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own. The story is told in a smart and unique way, much to thank for David O. Russell's screenplay, it's a great one. Brilliantly told.

The film stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, with Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, Anupam Kher, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles. The cast is filled with acclaimed actors and they doesn't disappoint in this film, you'll find some incredible performances in this film. The ones I want to point out is of course Bradley Cooper as he simply nails the performance, probably one of his personal best. Jennifer Lawrence is the other actor that did a spectacular job, both her and Bradley Cooper deserved their Oscar nominations and all the acclaim. One performance that was really good but totally unexpected was Robert De Niro, now I know how amazing he are and he's personally one of my favorite actors, but I didn't think he would be this good in a comedy. My favorite scenes was actually with him and Bradley Cooper, great chemistry as father and son. But everyone hits the mark in the comedy aspect of the film, it's a great mix between drama and comedy. Loved it.

David O. Russell's direction is like always perfect, he got an Oscar nomination for it and he's seriously worthy of all the praise, for his direction and screenplay. The editing is a major part of why it's incredible, it's extremely fast paced with quick cuts. I don't really like it that much but I understand why it's edited that way, in an artistic way its great as you get the feeling that you're in Patrick's shoes as you get the feeling of how crazy the manic episodes are. When there aren't any episodes, the pacing is much slower and there aren't any quick cuts. Seriously, a fantastic job.

Silver Linings Playbook deserves all the acclaim that it got, it's a fresh take on a worn out genre that's often too cheesy, the romantic genre that is. But David O. Russell created an original story with flawed but likeable characters, he also gave the actors lots of freedom as one of my favorite scenes was improvised, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro shared that scene. It got nominated for Best picture at the Oscars and for good reasons, it's possibly one of the best romantic drama-comedies I have seen.",10

30 June 2019,A Near Perfect Effort Where Every Viewer Can Find Something To Enjoy.,"It took me 7 years to watch this because I didn't like the title. Yeah, I know, a terrible reason not to see a 'future classic' film. Because I don't watch 'The Hunger Games' series, I had never encountered Jennifer Lawrence. To me, Bradley Cooper was the guy from 'The Hangover' series. So, I guess I wasn't in a hurry to see 'Hunger Hangover with a Happy Ending'.

I was wrong to dismiss 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012). This is probably one of the greatest 'Romantic Comedies' of all time. It's a unique love story for the 21st century, featuring several amazing performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. The writing is really effective - the funny moments are very funny, and the serious moments can be very emotional. The film features a a dance routine, but it doesn't beat the audience over the head with music and dance. Also, it should be noted, that the dance sequence at the end is amazing.

If you haven't seen it, watch it.

13 May 2013,family world,"David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is not a romantic comedy in the general sense of the term. Far from the movies featuring crazy situations while it's obvious how everything will turn out, this movie looks at the problems that have affected the main characters. The behavior of the bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) gives one a sense of how hard it must be to be around bipolar people, while it is understood that his behavior is unintentional. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) has also had problems in her life but is looking for a change. Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is the character that really caught my eye: he comes across as a damaged individual who just does what he thinks is best.

The movie adds up to a really good look at what Pat has to go through to reach his full potential. It was also interesting seeing Chris Tucker in this movie, since we've gotten used to him playing silly roles. He's very believable in this serious role. Really good film. I'd say that Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar win (although I didn't see every nominated movie).",10

15 August 2020,Anything but funny.,"Interesting, yes. Emotional, yes. Intriguing, absolutely. Good actors, good story. But saying it's a comedy is about the same as calling ""a nightmare on elm street"" a romance. Absolutely not a comedy.

2 December 2012,It's self-aware but never smug,"It seems over the years that all romantic comedies have been stamped with the rather dishonest label of ""chick flicks"" due to their fluffy nature and their schmaltzy screenplays that seem to cater only to the needs of day-dreaming women that are looking for ninety minutes of simple escapism. Not Silver Linings Playbook. This is a serious and simultaneously entertaining romantic comedy that doesn't substitute antics for characters or reality for humor.

History teacher Paul Solitano (Bradley Cooper) has just been discharged from a mental hospital and can no return home to his parents' home after he catches his wife in the act of infidelity eight months ago and completely lost it. He learns that his father (Robert De Niro) is out of work, and making money off high-stakes gambling on the Philadelphia Eagles, and his wife has moved away and gotten a restraining order against him. Paul must now begin the time-consuming task of rebuilding his life and repair surrounding relationships in his life that have no been dismantled because of his bipolar disorder.

Paul winds up meet his friend's wife's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who has been going through the pain of losing her husband and then committing random sex acts down at her workplace. Meeting each other, we can see they strike immediate chemistry, but their personal albatrosses, Paul with his ongoing devotion to finding his wife, and Tiffany with her inability to keep consistent with her behavior and emotions roadblock them into forming a solid, sustainable relationship together.

After spending enough time together, Tiffany reveals to Paul that she could deliver a letter written by him to Nikki and be the messenger between them if he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. One of the several subplots, which is handled mainly in the final half of the film, is Paul and Tiffany trying to make a bet on a dance competition and a football game work out in Paul's father's favor, as he is facing impending financial trouble with another gambler, and another one involves Paul's father's OCD and superstitions to try and make the Eagles win games. With all this madness and little sub-plots thrown into the blender, you wouldn't believe that they work in unison.

The catch is they do and they do so in a method I can only relate to writer/director Alexander Payne and his barrage of delightful human comedies such as About Schmidt, Sideways, and most recently The Descendants. Payne constructs his characters with layers, making them relatable and easy to like, and writer/director David O. Russell (2010's Academy Award winning The Fighter) follows the same blueprint for success.

It also came to my attention that this picture further leads Bradley Cooper down the path of an A-list actor. His role in The Hangover is miles away from this one, and his character Paul is far off anything he's ever done, yet it seems he was born to play the role of a conflicted men who isn't all there from a mental standpoint. After coming off of the disappointing Hunger Games and the pathetic House at the End of the Street, I feared Jennifer Lawrence was on a path to mediocrity, but it took me about five minutes of her on screen before those two films slipped my mind. She embodies Tiffany in such a divine, confident way I was sure that she will continue to do more great things along this line of work. She is too not falling prey to the typical child-star Disney conventions, where young, mostly female actresses pick G and PG rated pictures that do not test them at all as people or character actors. Lawrence seems to be too good for that schlock. And it must be said as well that Robert De Niro, after a string of dismissible performances, has finally found his second calling in the film industry aside from breakneck mobster features and that is the sly, humorous father figure that is desperately trying to keep his troubled son close.

Both Pat and Tiffany wind up having some sort of complex, emotional outburst that affects them massively and the people around them also. Both sequences aren't played for laughs, but for complete seriousness which works in favor of the idea that Russell is not playing for cheap laughs but for respect for those with mental illnesses. Even in his sequences, Chris Tucker, noted comedian and actor that can take a light setup and drum it into something completely silly, is portrayed in a sincere light and is not offered up as the butt of the joke or a lame-brained, obnoxious best friend to reiterate everything Pat says (unlike Kevin Hart's role in Think Like a Man). Silver Linings Playbook is a simple, endearing exercise that is along the same line as Safety Not Guaranteed, in the idea that it's quirky and self-aware, but it has more to offer than stale fodder that passes for uniqueness.

Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro, and Chris Tucker. Directed by: David O. Russell.",8
11 July 2018,"Beyond boring, and VERY annoying.","Interestingly enough I wasn't expecting much from the film, despite very positive reviews from critics. There was very little about the film I enjoyed, actually, except for Bradley Cooper's good looks. This was a freaked out, messed up film! These characters have so many issues, were I actually supposed to root for any of them? I couldn't care less about any of them - especially Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just downright annoying. Man, I absolutely HATED this character!!

I know this was (probably) supposed to be a romantic film, but I didn't feel it. I literally couldn't wait for this to end, as I found it beyond boring. Is this the non-exciting, non-interesting, non-funny, non-romantic, non-ANYTHING, very annoying version of 'Shall we dance'?? I suppose this is what one would call a chick flick, coz it did absolutely nothing for me as a man. It didn't stir any of my senses, apart from wanting to hit the stop/eject button about a thousand times!

23 December 2018,"A heartwarming, pleasant movie with excellent lead performances and script","David O Russell just makes immensely fun, watchable movies. Silver Linings Playbook is a realistic and empathetic consideration of living with mental illness, and Cooper and Lawrence make the movie a success with excellent performances. From the first scenes, we empathize with Pat's day-to-day struggles and root for him to succeed. Cooper does a phenomenal job in showing the emotional swings and challenges to control himself that Pat goes through as a bipolar person. The romance and plot may be a bit forced and predictable, but Lawrence brings necessary depth to Tiffany's character. It's nothing earth shattering, but the script and performances allow the audience to really connect with and root for these unusual, struggling characters, and as I've come to expect from Russell, you get a somewhat traditional movie executed well that's just enjoyable to watch.

23 February 2013,A mess,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker.

21 June 2013,Merely Old Kinderhook,"I was a bit worried when I read the synopsis to this movie: "" A teacher is released from a mental institution . Things get more when he meets a mysterious woman with problems of his own "" I thought because of a high profile court case that concluded in England earlier today it might have involved the teacher going to France and Chris Hansen making a cameo performance but this thankfully didn't happen . As I found out SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the film that seemed to capture - if not the world's heart - certainly the heart of the Oscar voters . After seeing the film I'm rather puzzled why ?

In many ways it's similar to a Woody Allen film with neurosis , family issues , dinner parties and potential mismatched romance featuring prominently . The one thing the film does get right is its research in to medication . I really can testify trazadone will indeed "" flatten you out "" . However I've never understood why when ever Allen writes as much as a shopping list it gets bombarded with awards left right and centre . Likewise I'm puzzled how this movie got bombarded with so many awards . I should confess I've never been a fan of romantic comedies and it was only the critical praise the movie it got that made me watch it . Certainly if you're a cruel hearted cynic like myself SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK won't convert you in to liking the romantic comedy genre any more",5
5 September 2014,disappointed,"I was getting tired of re-watching my favorite movies so I decided to try this one out, as it got good reviews and won some awards. And I'm baffled why. Maybe because it tried to be different? I definitely could see an attempt at it. But different is not necessarily good. It appeared that it was trying to be different for different's sake, not trying to be a good original story.

The essence of a good rom-com is the chemistry between the two protagonists. Everything else is just filler. In very good rom-com's, the filler is interesting as well. But in this one, the filler was uninteresting and contrived. And there was a lot of it. It took a good half hour or so before we got to see Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence together. And when we finally got to see that, it was disappointing. They are fine actors on their own but do not have much chemistry together. No chemistry between the romantic couple and an uninteresting story in this movie. So what's it got? Not much.

2 July 2018,A well-written and solidly-acted romantic comedy,"I have to say that every actor in this movie is brilliant, Cooper, Lawrence, Tucker, Weaver, and most noticeably De Niro. They all should have won some awards for their performances. The screenplay is fantastic, particularly in lines and jokes. The plot is a little bit predictable but still quite convincing. The standard four-act structure makes the movie rather accessible, even by the most common moviegoers, and that's why the film got a really high revenue.

25 February 2013,Mama weer all crazee now. 72.5+%,"This is a very odd, unconventional movie. It's about a man, Pat (played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper seems familiar to me from somewhere...), who is released from a mental institution and who tries to win back the affections of his wife...but she has a restraining order on him! Pat had an undiagnosed mental condition which makes him violent, hence his wife's restraining order. We don't really see much of the wife in this movie. Pat is put into the path of Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), another damaged personality who also has had dealings with the medical fraternity over her mental health issues.

Here's why this movie is so odd and unconventional...Pat is a very unlikeable fellow. It's hard to root for him, hence my lower score. If Cooper was going for a very unlikeable portrayal of a damaged man, then I suppose Oscar recognition is not out of the question. Pat is clueless as far as his interactions with people is concerned and he also lacks self-awareness. Jennifer Lawrence is very sexy in her role (in a Meg Tilly kind of way...but more so) but she isn't a conventional leading lady either. It's hard to imagine what Tiffany sees in Pat...perhaps it's just a case of beautiful people being attracted to each other, even though they may be abrasive personalities (to say the least, especially of Pat)? Lawrence puts together a very strong performance and deserves her Oscar for best actress (I still prefer Naomi Watt's turn in ""The impossible"" though, for drawing out powerful emotions from the viewer).

I've bumped up my score (and maybe could have given it 75%, say) for the end game of the movie. The leading characters warm, as does the movie, as they/it become more conventional in a rom-com kind of way...you do start to root for the characters. So, eventually, this does turn into a date movie.

Robert De Niro as Pat's father (Pat Sr.) is 'interesting'...you can see that Pat Jr. did inherit some of his genes from him! Jacki Weaver as Pat Jr's mother Dolores has some emoting early on in the movie and does give the occasional arch look. Her accent was good (Australians are better at American accents than Americans are at Australian accents)...I don't think she ever lost the accent but maybe once it seemed to lose its flavour. Have heard in the media (perhaps in Australia) that she was nominated for an Oscar in this movie for her performance in the great Australian movie ""Animal kingdom""...which is the way of Hollywood. Chris Tucker as a fellow crazy of Pat the younger is sort of a running gag in this movie.

Did find some of the early shots in the movie rather awkward...a bit too self- conscious...perhaps with Weaver, especially.

Two of the subplots in this movie were rather odd too...a business sideline of Pat Sr. as well as a ""Strictly ballroom"" kind of turn (the Australian movie).

Even when the leading actors were being abrasive (early on, especially), there was still much humour to be had in this movie.",7
24 February 2019,Really Good,"I was not expecting to like this movie. I didn't want to like it. Part of me tried not to like it, even while I was watching it, but I just couldn't help it. I really liked it! I think the reason I didn't think I would like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK was because of the trailer. Usually I can get a pretty good idea of how much I'll like a movie from the trailer. Sometimes I'm wrong, but not often. But this time I was.

The reason I watched it even though I didn't think I'd like it was because a friend of mine told me that it was really good and that it would be different than I expected. This was the same friend who recommended GIRL, INTERRUPTED to me (not a fan), so I was skeptical. But he was right this time. It was so much better and different than expected. The story seems predictable at first, but it goes in a completely different direction than you think it will. Recommend.

3 May 2013,Horrible. Total waste of time.,"No need to even think of including spoilers. Countless clichés, annoyingly grating and loud, unnecessary profanity, predictable. Did I mention utterly formulaic?

Are the great reviews all planted from those associated with the movie - actors, friends, movie companies and marketers? Or is the movie going public aiming so incredibly low that they no longer have a concept of what makes a movie watchable, never mind great (or even good)?

My daughter warned me that we would hate this (she certainly did)....and she was absolutely right.

I guess I need some more lines for this to be published. The movie is loaded with racial stereotypes....even the actors are stereotypes of themselves (DeNiro is vintage Capone type DeNiro...essentially mailed it in). Jennifer Lawrence is clearly a fine actress, but this role is an insult to her talent. And...really...Julia Stiles? Maybe that was the dead giveaway that this is a horrible movie.

Is that enough lines of text? How many more ways do I need to say ""avoid this movie at all costs""?",1
8 March 2014,A breakthrough performance for Bradley Cooper,"Dramatizing mental illness has always been a tricky proposition for the movies. How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi- layered condition.

In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.

But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight.",8

30 July 2014,Very overrated,"I don't know if it's because I expected too much, or the movie simply wasn't that good. But it really bored me. The acting is just OK, both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, let alone Academy Award standard. I watch the movie and I think it's just a standard romantic comedy, nothing so special and I can't really get the hype about it. There are a lot of more authentic and astounding movies that are worth watching way more than The Silver linings Playbook. This is not a bad movie, but it's just not excellent and I don't think it deserves all the good things people have said about. I loved Jennifer Lawrence in Winter Bones and I think she's gonna make a lot of good movies, but Bradley Cooper's acting is not my favorite.

27 January 2013,"Paradox, delusional narrator commits to dance","The Oscars are famously fuddy in a cinematic sense. So, having earlier this week murmured at the snubbing of Moonrise Kingdom, I am now pleased to see this film take its place in the lineup. Part of me is not convinced by some of it, for instance that we should be shown in films the achievement of a perfect happiness as the ending depicts here, if you will a happiness that is happiness because it is perfect. In reality, things rarely fall into place but that shouldn't preclude happiness of the present moment, being whole now with just this whatever it is, in a Buddhist sort of way.

But on with the film.

I come to this as a viewer steeped in narrative dissonance, paradox and asymmetry, these are all things I value in the films I see, in particular when those are carried in a visual way—the Japanese are masters of this, try and track down the seldom-seen All About Lily Chou Chou.

The story here is that we follow a distressed group of more or less delusional people who suffer the usual social frictions with an unusual acuteness, precisely the fact that things are not into place but broken, and through the film overcome their damaged selves to come out on the other end, still more or less damaged but whole. In truth, we all walk through life with delusional expectations of the ideal life, this is just comically exaggerated in this group.

This is most clear in the football-obsessed father, who outgrows his compulsive disorder that in order for his team to win, things or people have to be in a certain place, in a certain order. They don't, life fluctuates. It can go either way. The acceptance of this fundamental truth is what in my eyes sets this apart from something like The Descendants, a touristy film that mistakes manufactured beauty (linked to memory as a Hawaiin postcard) for purity.

The beauty is all in the recognition that things are damaged, dissonant, incomplete. Which brings me to my main point—all of this is wholly carried in the narrative in a visual manner.

The obvious first. The narrator is clearly delusional—to that effect throughout the film the camera is tightly screwed at eye-level, intensely prowls as he does and bursts into views. The narrative has a bipolar energy, with mood swings all over the place. In that vein, I would have liked more swings in the mood, in the 'color' of the camera, together with more visual narration, but so be it, the film is dialogue-driven first, plot-focused.

This type of first-person camera I have elsewhere remarked that can achieve the literary effect of stream-of-consciousness, of consciousness hovering in and off itself, where what we see is not necessarily 'real', but as Malick exemplifies and Herzog before him, can lead to ecstatic perceptions of 'real' intensity.

The filmmaker is aware of something along those lines, you will see in the scene where the man attacks his father in the wedding video scene, that suddenly remembered images from the earlier assault that was the breaking point burst into view.

In line with bursting views, mood swings, and the acceptance of a dissonant life is the dancefloor climax—things fall into place when you commit to the dance together, the dance as love, but this doesn't have to be the ideal dance as you'd normally expect, a 5.0 will do.

And in the actual dance, we have abrupt swings from ballroom jazz to rock'n'roll, from normalcy to how these people experience feelings. The dance reflects who these people are together, a little sloppy but committed.

That's all more than enough. What makes it so enjoyable though, and ultimately exhilarates, is that the whole is continuously stitched with paradoxical behavior. I only recently discovered Lubitsch, whose famed 'touch' was about exactly this.

The finale still bothers, but I can write it out of my mind. This is good stuff.",
6 May 2015,A little too much by the playbook...,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker.

5 December 2012,Russell gets the best from his cast in this unconventional romance,"Look around Hollywood and you get the feeling that the art of the romance movie is either dying or has been dead for some time. Romance as a genre term has practically been replaced by the phrase ""rom-com,"" and the only alternatives are gooey teen-geared fare (""Twilight"" or a Nicholas Sparks adaptation) or the occasional period love story. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" doesn't fit any one category, and perhaps therein is its bit of genius.

Although you can't exactly put label on and file away director David O. Russell's follow-up to his heavily awarded ensemble drama ""The Fighter,"" that's not to say this new film is completely unique. Rather, it tells a predictable romance in an unconventional fashion.

As part comedy, ""Silver Linings"" has none of the dramatic weight of ""The Fighter"" or quite the same storytelling power, but both films share one critical thing in common: convincing turns from an ace ensemble cast. Russell loves familial dysfunction, and while the stakes never feel quite as high as ""The Fighter"" (that's the last comparison), the performances have this touching humility to them. Russell clearly has a penchant for getting the best from his talent.

Stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence receive a special opportunity to take their already proved talent to another level as Pat and Tiffany, two people recovering from recent past traumas with diagnosed mental issues and boatloads of sexual tension. At the same time, as much of an excuse as they have to let their characters snap without warning, they still have to make it convincing and they do.

Cooper's Pat comes home to live with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) in Philadelphia after the court has allowed for his release from a mental institution in Baltimore. Although he refuses to take meds, we meet Pat in a place where he's on the mend, or at least believes he has the tools to overcome his past: stay positive, work to make yourself better and and look for the silver lining. The trouble is he's still hung up about his wife, Nikki, who is directly connected to the source of his issues.

In taking the steps that he believes will allow Nikki to love him again, Pat meets Tiffany, whose husband died recently. She has her own philosophy for coping, and becomes a major curveball in Pat's self-prescribed plan. Her connection to Nikki through her older sister Veronica (Julia Styles) further complicates her and Pat's relationship.

""Silver Linings"" dances around a bit when it comes to its core thread. Pat and Tiffany's relationship and complicated ""romance"" (it becomes clear from their first scene together that they have chemistry and will end up entangled romantically somehow) is definitely the centerpiece of the film, but it constantly shifts lenses. At first it appears to be about mental illness, then it morphs into a story about acceptance, then it focuses on making connections, then it becomes about perspectives, etc. These are all valid and generally related ideas, but the film drifts through them and the script never makes any deep cathartic breakthroughs as a result.

That's when you have to start peeling back the many layers of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" to see it as a romance story and family drama. As complicated as things are between Pat and Tiffany, the essence of their relationship can be identified as a need for an honest connection, to not let the past or the judgments of others complicate what is clearly pure chemistry.

The parallels to the film's family relationships are clear, though the romantic and family threads aren't quite interconnected until a plot device at the end binds them all together. In his best role in years, De Niro plays a caring but emotionally distant father obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He has turned to bookmaking after losing his job and it has brought out the worst of his superstitious compulsions. His own fixation mirrors his son's, yet they are both too blinded to see the similarities in their differences.

Relationship dynamics are at the heart of any ensemble film and the praise tends to get limited to acting, but Russell's direction could be the unsung hero of ""Silver Linings"" among general audiences. His camera is particularly active for a film in this genre cluster and it results in several angles and takes that add to the relationship tension. There's also an almost frenetic pacing at times that he uses to capture some of the mental instability of the main characters. It can be a frustrating tactic, but it forces us to relate to the characters by experiencing the film as they experience the world, Pat specifically.

Russell occasionally veers into comic territory as well with his technique. ""Silver Linings"" draws a lot of its humor from dysfunction between characters both in written dialogue and physicality of performance, but Russell — in a way that feels spontaneous — gives the humor an extra bite so we realize we're also supposed to be enjoying ourselves while watching the film.

""Silver LInings Playbook"" could at any time take a turn for the heavy side of things given the material, but Russell's choice to lean a bit more toward his quirkier roots gives it a real crowd-pleasing quality. The decidedly romantic and satisfying ending definitely assures this, but arguably of more importance, the choice accurately reflects the film's message of optimism, to see things with a certain perspective.

So despite not always being cohesive and movingly eloquent, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" entertains and never apologizes for what it is — or isn't.

10 February 2020,A modern day classic!,"One of the greatest films made in recent years; smart, hilarious, sad and brilliantly romantic with lovely performances and written so well. Ultimately pretty feel-good too which always helps! Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are absolutely stunning in the central roles; they fully become the characters Pat and Tiffany, which we root for every step of the way. Pat's parents Pat Senior and Dolores are performed to absolute perfection by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, their support and want for their son to feel better is a thoroughly engaging, emotional and often times funny aspect. Very much like the film itself! Every performance is great in this film, from Chris Tucker's Danny to John Ortiz's Ronnie. It is based on a novel by Matthew Quick adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell (Joy, I Heart Huckabees) who has crafted such a beautiful warm hug of a film that I really must go and buy the source material too! Everybody in the cast and crew should be so proud for having made this gem. Hell of a great soundtrack

16 March 2013,"A feel-good, enjoyable comedy-romance","""Silver Linings Playbook"" belongs to the category of good and sane American comedies, with some drama and romance, where all the necessary components are carefully and wisely rationed out to give rise to a pleasant and always enjoyable product. First, a well-constructed plot, that besides some conventions moves forward quickly and grippingly, and never concedes a single moment of boredom; then, an intelligent screenplay, that without sounding that original, is able to touch some emotional chords in a delicate way, with the addition of some funny lines. In addition, the intelligent use of a camera, to focus on the eyes of the protagonists to try to capture their inner distress to the utmost, and the emotional power of a varied and intense soundtrack, ranging from soul, to jazz to pop. Given all this, let's add a very strong cast, and the successful result is granted. The couple Cooper-Lawrence works perfectly, they are fully in sync, the former offers and unusually intense performance, and the latter gives a very promising adult-performance, considering her young age. But (and that goes without saying), the best performance goes to the always exhilarating Robert De Niro, who plays the obsessive-compulsive father with both strong and funny pathos and interacts with the loving mother Jackie Weaver in a very joyfully and heartfelt manner. To sum up, if you are looking for a feel-good comedy, just enjoy this comedy, which deserves the merit of facing the relation between mental disorder and love, with that amusing but respectful attitude, which is not so easy to find in movies.",7
28 January 2020,Nice Movie to Watch (8.5),"Another great movie from David O. Russell they often use the same lead actors(Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert De Niro) the cast was great and the cast was good and it was beautifully reflected in this movie.

The subject is beautiful, different story, scenario strong interesting at the same time funny and sometimes emotional and romantic as in every film that reflects the style of the director, we see confusion and strange family relationships within the family. Joy movie is very similar in terms of family relations I like your style.

Just the end of the movie seemed a little simple to me it felt like they finished quickly. Maybe they should have given Nikki more time. We could only see the words she said in her ear it was a short scene that the name in the whole movie I think it could have been a good enough movie.

28 February 2013,Not a Spoiler though.. just story,"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK

Please visit - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.in/

'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' is a sensitively soothing romantic dramedy! With an apparently simple yet contextually deep screenplay, it touches your heart at many levels.

Aided by some incisive performances from its cast, the film is an emotional treat.

Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now lives with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert DeNiro) after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, butonly if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.

The film is adapted from a novel by the same name, by Matthew Quick. The film never attempts to reach those heights of a deeply meaningful cinema or social satires and that'exactly why it succeeds. It provides you with naturalistic experience of a rom-com with grit and emotion of a realist drama. The characters are believable and skilfully sketched. These two hours at the theater infuse positivism and contentment within you. It's a perfectly suitable drama for these anxious times that we live in. There's love and warmth, there's emptiness and heartbreaks, there's optimism and competitiveness , and yet there's contentment in all of this and so much more that life gives. The director gives you a lot to like over here especially the breeziness that he brings to a tale of two misfits trying to make it work. Essentially a comedy, he balances this film perfectly by giving some serious heart to it. It's modern, delightful and absorbs you completely. And in the end you leave with a smile on your face.

Performances are basically the life of this film. A subject like this could've easily got derailed if the performances fell any short of what they are right now. The lead actors give it depth and deliver two of the most moving performances you'll ever see. Bradley Cooper surprises you with his acting prowess. Usuallyconsidered as merely a good looking charmer, he surfaces a totally unforeseen side of his talent. He proves how underrated an 'actor' he has been. Jennifer Lawrence is superb too. Her character has multiple complex shades that she portrays amazingly well. The support cast is terrific, bringing completeness to this fulfilling drama.

All-in-all, 'Silver Linings Playbook' can be perfectly defined as a ""serious romantic comedy"" which is intelligent and edgy, with romance at its core. Go for it!",8

12 March 2013,Not for Everybody,"Movies, of course, are subject to the likes/dislikes of the viewer. Despite trepidations over the weak cast (except, of course, for DeNiro), I chose to attend on the basis of this movie being nominated for an Academy Award. Unfortunately, what I found was a poorly scripted and poorly acted film that had no meaningful plot and no meaningful value. Clearly an ""A"" movie in production quality, the fact is that this movie has nothing to say. It seems to display dysfunctional characters for the purpose of capitalizing on those dysfunctional characters and nothing more. This movie might best have been left on paper.

I managed to stick with the movie to the end, mostly because I was with a group, and waited (impatiently) for something, anything, meaningful to happen. Sadly, nothing meaningful ever did happen.

Most people seem to have gotten something from this movie. If you didn't, don't feel alone.",2
18 April 2022,Beautiful Just beautiful,"Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by David O. Russell. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, Anupam Kher, John Ortiz and Julia Stiles.

Pat was sent to a mental institution for beating his wife's lover, now he tries to reconcile with his ex-wife with the help of a mysterious girl.

One of the best rom-com I have seen in recent times and all credit should be given to the electrifying performance by Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and is beautifully supported by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver.

The plot of the film is good and execution is superb, the film has all the necessary ingredients to keep you hooked and will make you smile, laugh and cry. The film depicts the problem of bipolar disorder with utmost perfection. The film has been executed with so perfection that the film looks realistic.

Acting is superb in the film and both the leads had been magnificent in their respective character. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver performance works as an icing on the cake.

Climax of the film is beautiful and gives a superb closure to a wonderful film. A Must watch refreshing Rom-Com.",8
9 December 2018,Silver Linings Playbook (2012),"A witty, funny and emotional film about a unique person with psychological issue. A story about recovery of soul, redemption and struggle. And they are beautifully captured to film.

8 November 2019,Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks.,"I found 'Linings' an interesting movie with pros and cons. Pros: Dealing with mental illness - and hope for the future; interesting to see Lawrence in a role so different than Hunger Games. Cons: When I read the various comments and history of the film, it was nominated for so many Academy Awards? Really? Didn't seem that special.

5 May 2019,Ingenious Plays,"This is Russell's second best film and one of the best in the dramedy genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast delivers top notch performances with Cooper, Lawrence and DeNiro standing out. The plot revolves around a man who has lost it all landing him in a mental hospital for a stint. He returns home to live with his family where they hope he can rebuild his life and revive his love and his family's love for the Philadelphia Eagles. Essentially just be normal again whatever that is. Upon returning home the man meets a women with issues of her own and subtle sparks ignite. Their relationship is based on doing eachother a favor but evolves into much more. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it's nearly impossible for this viewer to pick a favorite but if I a had to it would be the dance contest. The film is witty, clever, unique, insightful, has a superlative love story and has a cathartic ending. It is mesmorizing, captivating and a relationship building story all around for the ages.

10 August 2020,Not perfect but definitely good,"I have just finished the film and read a fair bit of reviews before writing my own. This film is a unique and unusual rom/com, But in a good way.

The acting and cast is really great. I loved the relationship between Bradley's friend and the complicated one with Jennifer Lawrence. At times Jennifer is too whiny, and mean. Other times is cute and funny to see them bicker. I dont know what having bi polar is like but with the reviews I've seen made by bi polar people i will have to take their word for the accuracy the actors depicted bi polar disorder.

The screenplay and plot direction was pretty enjoyable. There are very cheesy moments but I dont personally mind it. You get attached to Bradley's character and really want to root for him. You also can't help feeling bad for him because of his condition and traumatic past expierence. There is lots of fights on screen which does get old but is still palatable. The football talk is also very overwhelming for someone who isn't American or doesn't give a baloney about the sport. The romance is very unique, unusual but sweet and cute in my opinion. Overall its a interesting Rollercoaster of a story.

Summary: A weird rom/com that has its problems but was a enjoyable and unique film. With all its problems, the good parts far out way the bad. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to watch a rom/com that hasn't been done a thousand times before.",7
10 March 2013,The Game of Life in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK,"Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen.

By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor. By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.

Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care. Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order. He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement. When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks. One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone. Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife. What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.

The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors. Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly naïve, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone. DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is. Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.

The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life. The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism. When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger. He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive. Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if 'this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the 'silver lining' in his life.

It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees. At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is. Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.

When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor. Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director. His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization. His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong story lines. Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.",10
29 January 2021,a promising movie,"It's a beautiful love story. Crazy characters hold on to life with love. Just like its title, it is a promising movie. Only the betting part is a little silly.

4 February 2013,Waste of 2 hours of my life,"I want to send an invoice to the director for reimbursement of the rental cost. This movie is full of overblown and superficial characters, none of which the viewer can engage with or empathise with. Whether this is the fault of the scriptwriter, director or the actors themselves is not clear. What is clear is the movie's awards nominations to date are not the least bit justified. Whilst I applaud the subject matter and the attempt to convey a message to the greater audience about the dilemmas of having a family member dealing with mental illness, there is no doubt there are far superior movies already available covering this topic.

18 November 2012,Excelsior! Cooper & Lawrence's scary/good intense chemistry is worth the ticket price alone; one of the year's best.,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

8 February 2013,Meandering manipulative mayhem.,"If you are going to make a comedy romance where the lead suffers from violent bi-polar disorder then it might not be a bad idea to make sure the headliner has kind blue eyes and sensitive features ala Bradley Cooper to keep it light and get you over the rough patches as he does in Silver Linings Play Book. Cooper who may well be the 21st century version of Jimmy Stewart does a commendable job of doing so but director David O Russell has a hard time getting his recipe of dash's of other films (Footloose, Last Tango, Saturday Night Fever) to reach comic heights because of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room, the illness with its violent overtones as a comedy launch pad.

After teacher Pat Solitano finds his wife handing out favors to a fellow educator he goes nuclear and nearly beats him to death. Institutionalized for eight months his mother signs him out against advice and the volatile young man heads home to Philly to win his wife back. It doesn't take long for Pat Jr. to act out again with a half a dozen infractions that should send him right back to the bin but it seems the enormous patience of friends and the community (Philly mind you) is full of forgive and forget. Enlisting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence)to help in his crusade he grudgingly agrees to enter a dance competition with her. With issues of her own the two form an abrasive alliance.

Silver Linings breaks from the box fast with loose cannon Pat's unpredictability and unsettling behavior direction yet to be established but once it settles into it's comedy slot it is little more than a hyper When Harry met Sally. Lawrence and Cooper have some nice go rounds but outcome is telegraphed well in advance and the humor to help get us there runs its course fast.

To give the film its energy Russell shoots most of it in disorienting close-up with a fair amount of middle of the street restaurant and home scenes that lack verisimilitude in their drama or comedy edge with their sarcastic punch lines.

As Pat's parents Jackie Weaver spends most of the film welling up and wringing her hands while Robert DiNero as his bookie dad plays it with a little more intensity than his Focker dad. It is a terrible waste as we see glimmers of the greatness that was Di Nero in scenes played as straight drama instead of comedy between father and son may have made for a far better film with lighter box office returns. Russell remains intent however in coming up with ""the feel good comedy of the year"" with a touch of edge but Silver Linings Playbook double bladed topic, silly comedy out of serious illness is ultimately a dull swipe at it.",5
24 February 2020,True love is crazy Love,"True love is a crazy Love,I think the story was perfect & I give a lot of credit to David O. Russell for the screen play that's really nice true romance movie to me, and about artists, I think Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence, are just great artists & they did just fine but one more thing is this fact that the way Robert De Niro acting in this picture was something especial & He's Just Perfect in acting as always.

18 June 2019,Pure brilliance!,"I thought this movie was pure brilliance! I found it so powerful and gut wrenching in parts, I really felt for the characters. Pat and Tiffany are damaged, you feel that however against all the odds they fix each other. 'Silver Lining Playbook' has such beautiful morals and ideologies. It went from the depths of really low points of Pats life to the moment we were all praying for. I think this was drama more than comedy but the wonderful thing is you found yourself laughing when you didn't realise it, almost feeling embarrassed to finding things funny about difficult people with such serious problems. The jokes are subtle but I went through all sorts of emotions watching this, bravo to all that went into making this, they deserve all the credit they received. Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro especially were unbelievable. A rare and first 5 star review from me.

29 June 2014,one more question mark,"Silver Linings Playbook is one of those movies that explore mental conditions. For some reason, these movies have more weight than ""other"" movies and are usually used to prove actors abilities. And this is exactly what happened here.

The main characters were portrayed by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. They both deliver fine performance, yet not very memorable, as critics in awe would like us to believe. For example, Bradley Cooper running around wearing a plastic bag presumably actually happened in real life cases, but didn't work out for me.

The plot might have been realistic, yet it simply failed to engage me. Despite all this, Silver Linings Playbook is not a bad movie, it rather hasn't been exceptionally good.

12 January 2013,Everything a movie should be.....,"We laughed our heads off; we got teary-eyed; we held our collective breath(s); we beamed with happiness and pride; we were stunned with surprise a few times, too. These characters are LIKABLE -- a little unpredictable -- but still WONDERFUL. The story was mesmerizing, well-paced, and COMPLETE.

Robert DeNiro was, as always, brilliant. Simply brilliant.

This film is a breath of fresh air in all ways. Although deeply troubled and confused, Bradley Cooper is absolutely lovable here. One just can't help but pull for everyone in this story.

I DO hope this film does well at the Academy Awards. Many of the other films nominated are overly artsy, pretentious, lack story-telling talent, and are DULL. Not this movie! Go see it on the big screen --you will love it.",10

18 November 2017,Horrid beastly film,"I absolutely hated this film. I am amazed to hear it was meant to be a comedy. I only lasted 40 minutes or so. The company of mentally ill people behaving like sad lunatics is hardly agreeable, certainly not where they are behaving in a totally ridiculous manner all the time. I can only echo what reviewer Pinko 2004 wrote:

'This film contains a horrific depiction of mental illness that objectifies human beings as caricatures. Cooper's character, who is supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them.'

Absolutely! Hated it, hated it, hated it!

20 June 2013,A Feel Good Romantic Comedy,"I went into Silver Linings Playbook with a sense of optimism. I had gotten free tickets to this through a promotional deal so I had no personal investment going in. Being advertised as the feel good movie of the year I must say that this movie totally delivers, it wasn't even until I left the theatre that I realized I was watching a romantic comedy. The movie walks a thin line between adult-oriented family drama, and romantic comedy. It is a tricky tone to establish if any major department comes up short. Fortunately, the writing clicks, the direction is solid, and the actors have enough chemistry to make you forget your watching a movie; at least until the curtains come up.

I usually don't like Bradley Cooper (38) as he often plays too much of a jerk in his movies; typecast as a cocky womanizer in most of his other roles, but I was surprised he was able to put together a performance where he was just crazy enough for the audience to relate to, but not too far gone to be alienating.

Having just seen ""The Hunger Games"", I initially figured Jennifer Lawrence (22) was far too young to play a widow, but she is often able to bring a certain amount of maturity to the roles she takes on. This is vital to a film that casts to lead actors with 15 years between them to carry on a chemistry that is believable and it mostly works.

As for the rest of the acting Robert De Niro seems to have more life in him in this role than we've seen in years. I particularly loved the scene where he is speaking to Bradley Cooper's character asking him to spend some quality father and son time watching a football game with him. The emotions of disappointment wash over his face in one of the films standout moments.

The remaining cast acts as filler serving the main performances. You get fills Jacki Weaver acting as a stereotypical old age mother, and have Chris Tucker also pops in for a few funny scenes to sport extra comic- relief. Overall the ensemble works just as it should with performances that slightly elevate standard rom-com material.

In a crowded holiday season, I like to look for a real gem and this movie stands out as one of the better films of 2012, and will most likely get Oscar attention from the academy come awards season.

Overall Grade: +2/ B+",9
8 October 2018,Silver linings never disappoints and is a movie for the ages,"Loved it. As a movie fanatic, everything from how great the acting by Jennifer is to the cast being phenomenal to the script has touched my life and heart for many years. It is so relatable and so inspirational that I can say it's one of my all time favorite movies and highly recommended

9 May 2020,Wonderful script,"Disturbingly fast-paced, and as heart-warming as it is hilarious. Telling us a happily-ever-after story but with dysfunctional protagonists. This is the most heart-warming drama I have ever seen. It's all about love between families, friends and people. Yes, you can talk about the great performances or well-written script or amazing soundtrack, but no words are enough to describe how heart-warming the film is.

By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",9
2 September 2013,Proof That Ratings Are Meaningless,"You instantly know that you are in trouble when the lead characters bond during discussion of psychotropic meds that they've been taking for their various mental disturbances. This is a new low in cute-meet, rom-coms. Since the main characters don't supply enough psychosis, there is the father with OCD for good measure. Maybe other people find mentally disturbed, erratic and violent characters a cute, but I don't.

It is hard to pinpoint whether Bradley Cooper's dreadful acting excesses were due to his lack of talent or, heaven-forbid, were exactly what the director wanted. In either case, I wanted to reach through the screen, grab him by the neck and tell him to shut up. As if this wasn't annoying enough, there was Robert De Niro's as his father to add two more forms of mental disturbance. He is an Eagle's fan and has OCD. Which is the worse mental illness is debatable, but enough is enough. There is hardly a quiet sane moment in the film. De Niro, by far the most overrated actor of the last 40 years, is his usual grumbling self. Since he said ""This is this"" in the Deer Hunter in 1978, he has been said every single line exactly the same. Jennifer Lawrence was the least annoying character, but she had her moments.

You can't help wonder why such a movie as bad as this gets such positive reviews. There is a apparently a large, devoted audience for maudlin, feel-good romances involving annoying people. As long as the couple ends up together, that seems to be all that matters. Steal a subplot from ""Shall We Dance"" for good measure and, voilà la, we have a winner.

There must be a strong self selection process in who goes to see such movies. The people who chose to see them are the kind of people to whom such sentimental trash appeals, so they are naturally likely to give it a good review. I saw it on an airplane for free because there nothing else but ""blow em up"" action and scifi movies and kid's stuff. Next time, I'll take a good book.",1

14 May 2013,"Entertaining, but a Whole Lot of Nonsense.","This movie left me wondering if, toward the end, all the characters would sit Bradley down and reveal some elaborate scheme they had ingeniously devised so that, ultimately, they would set him on the path towards sanity--AND to explain to the viewer why reality had seemed so warped in the movie up to that point...or SOMETHING that could demystify how every character acts like they need to be heavily medicated.

I have a few minor issues with this movie:

~The story line has little coherency. ~Each character is incredibly-emotionally invested in the most trivial of matters. ~In every scenario each character behaves as if this is how people regularly interact and communicate with each other...well, minus Bradley and Jennifer...and Chris Tucker...and Bradley's Dad...and Bradley's friend Pat...

Okay, so I guess this movie says crazy people tend to cluster together, even outside of an institution. That's all I could come up with.

Nonetheless, I give this a 6 out of 10 because, aside from the plot that leaves the sane baffled, the actors' performances are hugely entertaining. It's like a piece of modern art you see in a museum that catches your eye enough that you stop and stare for awhile; however, if you were asked to evaluate the artist, you couldn't bring yourself to regard it too highly because you know it's just a painting of random splotches and gravity at work (no paintbrush required).",5
10 April 2020,"Traditional comedy movie, recommended","In fact, everyone has such small psychological problems, such as coercion, depression, and irritability. This is where the audience resonates with the film. The story is more common, and develops in the expected direction. The trouble of one relationship is healed by the other. This is a traditional family ethics love comedy film, the story is built quite traditionally, acting is naturally the biggest bright spot, the climax of the arrangement is one after another, the final emotions are bright and bright, and the infectious and atmosphere of the story Awesome.

20 September 2018,Pretty Little Story,"I've just rewatched this film having seen it a few times but not in the last 3 years or so. Revisiting it I really do love it. It's a very sincere film with a difficult subject matter of a particualy mental illness. The three main actors, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro give tremendous performances. De Niro proves he can still give raw emotional meaning to a newly written character. The two leads have not given better performances than they have in this movie in my opinion. Bradley Coopers character Pat is put in a tough situation in this film which leads to really good character development and gives the audience insight on the mental illness while telling a compelling story. The cinematography was nice and would have meaning from time to time, it was shot on 35mm film wich I appreciated and fit right for the story. The score by Danny Elfman didn't really do anything for me personally. The editing was really well done, there were a lot of interesting uses of certain techniques used in the editing process that worked really well to help tell the story. The ensemble stood out in this film, it doesn't really seem apropriate to have an ensemble cast with so much screen time in a movie so personal to two main characters but it works here. David O'Russel does write ensembles very well in movies as seen in American Hustle and The Fighter. In the end, I really enjoyed this movie, it did a lot for me, I'm glad I rewatched it and if you haven't seen it or haven't watched it in a while I would definitely recommend doing so.",8

29 January 2020,Refreshing take on Rom coms,"Honestly i started to watch this movie just for the cast. The movie starts off with Pat being released from the mental institution and the first thirty minutes give u an impression of there is no where near a rom com. But as you get into the complexities of the characters of Tiffany and Pat, you just get involved. Thanks to terrific performance from Jennifer Lawrence who carried the multi dimensionality of Tiffany's character with atmost perfection. The movie donesnt have any cheesy lines or the leads holding hands and watching stars. It's just two up individuals who help each other to get better. Not to mention Robert deniro gave a stellar performance as Pat Sr. The movie is near perfect and a good watch for one time.

23 September 2018,Silver Linings Playbook Review.,"Such a wonderful movie. I watched the movie with my whole family last night and they all loved it. Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Best Actress Oscar for playing Tiffany Maxwell. Bradley Cooper was a,so very good. The whole cast was great overall. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both had great chemistry together. This movie should have won every single Oscar it was nominated for, including Best Picture. Such a funny and heartwarming movie, even though there are some intense moments involving Bradley Cooper's character, Pat, having meltdowns and getting into physical altercations nd some dramatic moments. Great film to watch. The film was nicely done.

28 December 2019,THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE (CRAZY) LIFE,"Silver Linings Playbook is a milestone in cinema about people with mental health problems. Usually seen as dangerous (as in Hitchcock's Psycho) or funny (Levinson's Rain Man), people with mental disorders end up losing control of their bodies and are treated apart, trapped or overprotected as it happens in real life.

David O. Russell's movie attempts, and succeeds in a different way, to turn the dramas of two ""troublesome"" people into a romantic comedy.

Handsome, athletic, and confident, Pat (Bradley Cooper) manages to be released from a mentally ill hospital where he remained for eight months after beating his wife's lover and still has a restraining order from her. Diagnosed as bipolar, he returns to his parents' home under the responsibility of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver).

The boy's father, Pat Sr., masterfully portrayed by Robert De Niro, also cannot be considered completely sane: stuck in a restaurant project, but unemployed, lives on bookmaking mainly football games, having an irrational passion for Philadelphia Eagles team, which is why he was banned from the stadium for fighting. Standing in front of the TV, he is convinced that a series of superstitious rituals can alter the outcome of the games.

The entry of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, fantastic), a young widow who lives in the neighborhood, represents a balance in the plot not because she is understanding and welcoming Pat, but precisely because she seems to be as crazy as he is. During a discussion, they pass in front of a restaurant and, seeing the sign Dines, he invites the girl:


Together, they comment on the effects of the various anti-anxiety and antipsychotics meds, and indulge in a ballroom dance project, which will be the movie's great climax: they will try to win a good position and still defend Pat Miller's ultimate bet.",9
11 January 2013,Truly fantastic,"I had been anticipating Silver Linings Playbook very much for a good while now, although I wasn't entirely sure I should be. It does look like some sort of romantic dramedy, and while the genre can work well many times, it's also not a genre that does anything particularly amazing for me. And while I liked Russell's The Fighter a good amount (his only other film I've seen) it's also the sort of film that quickly fades from memory. So I can't say how well I'll like a film like this as time goes by, but for now, I'm in love.

I never saw a trailer for this. I only saw a clip between Pat and Tiffany at the dinner table with another couple (who I now know is Pat's friend and Tiffany's sister), and the clip hugely impressed me. I loved Lawrence in Winter's Bone, but this just seemed like such a huge step for her. And then there was Bradley Cooper, making a large impression in the short two-minute clip that I was completely shocked. Who knew the guy from The Hangover could do so much in such a small clip? So for them I definitely had high expectations, just based on two minutes. And they certainly didn't disappoint in any way, shape or form. There have been some great duos in 2012, but no two actors electrify the screen together as much as Cooper and Lawrence. They bounce off each other magically, making me long for more recent films with a central relationship as dynamic and as charismatic as this. Lawrence nails every single second of her character. There's a real energy to her, you just can't look away. People have wondered whether this is just a really large supporting role. Here's the thing. When you look at cinema's history you see a lot of roles considered ""leading"" that are sometimes really large secondary characters to a more prominent lead. A great example is Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. But the reason he is ultimately seen as lead alongside Leigh is because of the amount of power he brings to the screen and for the fact that he brings to the film the type of spark that not everyone can achieve, and as a result the relationship between Blanche Dubois and Stanley is the central power to the film. The same goes for Lawrence here. Whatever she is in terms of category, she gives the best female performance of 2012. I say that without hesitation, and I truly hope she wins the Oscar over the also-great Chastain or Riva.

I wanted to talk about Lawrence before Cooper because, as it is, it's the performance with the most notices. But Cooper is just as equally magnificent and radiant, demonstrating a true talent for handling something as dramatic and comedic as this. He drives the film in ways no other actor of the year besides Jackman in Les Miserables did. But despite being the main lead of the film, his role is perhaps not as showy as Lawrence's. The role requires for a true navigation between many different emotional arcs that should drive the film in a clear and empathetic way. Cooper finds the perfect balance and as a result it's one of the easiest characters to sympathize and connect with in recent years.

The rest of the cast is strong, and De Niro and Weaver both do great in their roles. As is the case, I'm not sure why people are too upset about Weaver, especially when De Niro was seen as a strong, strong possibility for an Oscar nom for several weeks now and yet doesn't have all that much more to do than her. Based on reactions to the Oscar nods, I expected Weaver to be in it for very few scenes. She's more prominent than that for sure. The ending also worked brilliantly for me, but this is the type of ending that I could see perhaps weakening or making the film stronger when I reflect back on it later on. Ultimately, this is a very strong film and among the best of 2012.",

12 January 2013,Poor representation of bipolar disorder,"As soon as I heard the characters pronounce the drug Trazodone incorrectly twice near the beginning of the film, I knew this wasn't going to be an accurate portrayal of someone with bipolar disorder.

The two supposed ""mental cases"" didn't exhibit any unique traits that would pin them as bipolar or unipolar or psychotic or...anything. Also, was this supposed to be a romantic-comedy or a drama or a film about ballroom dancing and overcoming odds? What the hell was it? While I thought the acting was fine I was shocked that some consider it Oscar worthy! DeNiro was excellent but everyone else - just average.

Lastly, I would think the producers/directors would do some background research on mental illness before releasing a film like this. For one, find out how psychotropic medications are pronounced and what they are used for and find out the behaviors of a person suffering from bipolar disorder. I realize this wasn't a documentary on the subject but with a hefty production budget, can't you get the basics right?",2
6 February 2013,It's pronounced TrA-zadone,"Three months ago I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder, and then had to move back home with my parents... in Philadelphia. I was basically obligated to go to this movie and excited to see characters suffering from mental illness that I could relate to. I thought it was terrible. Like many commenters before me already said: unrealistic, erratic, and a cliché romcom at its core. That's my opinion... then again maybe I just need to up my Wellbutrin. Ask me what I think again when my mood is on the upswing.

Also, it takes at least a half an hour to get a cop out to your house in Philly.

3 August 2020,Perfect!,"Bradley Cooper hits the nail on the head with his acting and portraying someone who has bipolar. Jennifer Lawrence and him make a great team! I'm from Philly so the set locations around the area are an added bonus. Bradley really is tremendous in this!

27 January 2014,The meaning of true love...,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a nice movie and I liked it for many reasons but I have to say that I expected more from Bradley Cooper. This movie has to do with a teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who moves back in with his parents and he tries to regain his relationship with his ex-wife.

I liked in this movie very much the interpretation of Jennifer Lawrence and I believe that she deserved the Oscar for the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role of 2013. I have to say that I expected more form Bradley Cooper and I believe that he did not give us the 100% of his acting. An another interpretation that I want to mention is Robert De Niro's which I found it just perfect.

5 January 2013,Crazy in Love,"This film is recommended.

"" Every cloud must have a silver lining, Wait until the sun shines through, Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear, Or else I shall be melancholy too! ""

Lyrics from My Melancholy Baby by E. Burnett, G. Norton, & M.Watson


Love is strange. The search for Mr. or Mrs. Right comes with many obstacles and every relationship comes with its own special baggage. Some of its contents are neatly folded and with room to spare, nicely hidden in each fold while others are ugly and messy and filled to the brim. It's the latter type of baggage that we find in Bill O. Russell's dramedy, Silver Linings Playbook, a romantic comedy that always entertains, even if it willingly sacrifices realism in favor of that evasive feel good feeling.

Meet Pat and Tiffany, both bi-polar and both in need of love. Pat is just off a broken marriage for nearly a year, the result of his angry issues. Recently released from a mental institution due to a nervous breakdown, he encounters Tiffany, a tough-as-nails promiscuous widow, hasn't quite made it in the world of dating. Neither have the social skills or reserve to be seen as followers of the norm. In fact, they're the type of person that one avoids at all costs. Quirky with a capital Q, to put it nicely.

In fact, everyone in this Philadelphia neighborhood seems to be off kilter. Dad ( a solid Robert DeNiro ), an avid Eagles fan with anger issues of his own, has OCD and a heavy gambling problem. Mom ( Jackie Weaver, good but underused ) is the typical loving enabler, trying to calm everyone around her. All of their friends and relatives have less than happy lives. There's nowhere to go but up in this part of town.

Director / writer David O. Russell takes a very familiar scenario, two lovable misfits battling the odds, and plays it a little too safe. He seems more concerned with making a crowd- pleasing melodrama without any real consequences to his well-drawn characters. Russell's dialog is insightful and clever, quite poetic at times. but his plot structure is all over the place. He places his characters in different situations to force their reactions which ring false. Their highs and lows are mere plot devices to advance the story, but never go deeply into their mental instability or fragile state of mind. His intriguing lead characters deserve more than the film's predictable (and far fetched ) outcome.

However, it is the two main actors and their natural chemistry together that takes Silver Linings Playbook to a more honest and emotional level for the movie-going audience. Both actors lash out at each other, creating a commanding presence on screen. Bradley Cooper has never been better. He conveys the angst and confusion, that twisted sense of optimism that his character needs to survive. Jennifer Lawrence plays her damaged character openly raw and masking the internal pain. It is a remarkable portrait of vulnerability and inner strength. Yet what makes their performances so strong and memorable are the subtle glances, the silences, and words not shared between the cruelty of their actions.

If only the film would have been more courageous and truer to the issue of mental illness and its effects on loved ones, Silver Linings Playbook could have been a great film. It scores periodically whenever it starts to think outside the box and not follow the winning formula of most romantic comedies. But more often, the film is content to settle on staying inbounds and following that norm. GRADE: B

30 July 2020,An Impressive Rom Com,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
13 January 2013,Inspiring drama with plenty of flair from start to finish,"Truthfully, the only reason I watched this movie was to see how a seemingly cut-and-paste drama could land their director an Oscar nod above the more ambitious and creative Tarantino.

Silver Linings Playbook however deserves its Oscar nods, and almost even deserved that Best Director nod. With a nice realistic script and fantastic performances to follow, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the superior dramas of 2012 by combining plenty of raw emotion with charm and even some humor to ease the pain.

Bradley Cooper shines as a saddened bipolar man that moves in with his parents to try to get his life together. What follows are the interactions and behavioral changes amongst everyone around him after the several months he spent away in psychiatric care. And along the way he meets a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) that might be equally as much of a mess, but also equally in need of a good friend. Based off a Matthew Quick novel, it's much more drama than anything else but the characters will grow on you and will have you rooting for them on the final act.

David O. Russell is getting quite good at pulling off great performances from his cast, as he got a couple Oscars from his last movie The Fighter. This time around Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career by providing layers of likability even during his worst of moments and moments of detachment, while Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNrio are expectedly but still undeniably electric.

The chemistry amongst everyone in the film is what carries this movie throughout and past the dimmest and slowest of moments, when the movie starts to drag a bit in the final third. Russell doesn't have much to work with to flex the directing muscles, but gets the job done by providing calm basic cinematography while also tugging the heartstrings when necessary.

Overall, this movie is a good drama, pure and simple. It never becomes overly complex and bloated, it's just a straight up entertaining drama with an assortment of standout moments that swings past all the issues of running time and some fluff scenes. Silver Linings Playbook is a grounded drama that stands as one of the best of the year.",8

28 November 2012,The best film of the year!,"David Mamet blew me away with The Fighter. What looked like a generic sports drama from the trailers was really an intricate, overly entertaining, emotionally resonant character piece. I'm not sure how this came across in the trailers to me but there is no way it came across as brilliant there as the actual film is. Silver Linings like the fighter is an intricate character piece but even more evolved that film. It tackles complex, off the wall characters and story elements and combines them into a wonderfully unpredictable and emotionally endearing grade A cinematic stew. The film tells the story of a man named Pat (Cooper) who after an 8 month stint in a mental institution is released under his mothers care. You see he had a break because he found his wife cheating on him and was suffering from an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Along comes Tiffany (Lawrence) a young woman who has just lost her husband and is living with a variety of personality disorders. They meet a rom com storyline forms but doesn't move in the way you'd expect. This is a film about damaged, imperfect people. People everyone of us can relate to if we are honest. There are scenes of such emotional vigor and astonishing rawness it's hard to tell you're even watching something that has been orchestrated. Bradley Cooper sheds his Hollywood image and opts for an intensely brave and personal performance. Jennifer Lawrence shows up reminding us why she was nominated for an Oscar for Winter's Bone. Her character Tiffany is so fully realized through her performance it's hard to put in words. It's so real and unhinged it hurts to watch. Robert DeBiro stars as Pat's father in his best performance in years he displays the emotional complexities of his character his slight OCD, the longing for a relationship with his son and the fear he feels about it. Jackie Weaver is also really amazing as Pat's Mom so maternal and not in a scary way like her other mesmerizing performance in Animal Kingdom. Chris Tucker even shows up for some light hearted fun, some of his best work ever. Also I would love to spotlight the inspired cinematography the constant tracking shots really freshened up the events and kept things feeling new. The thing about this film is that it's not perfect. But it's about those imperfections who make us who we are and form the relationships and experiences we have. It's an honest, funny, hilarious, endearing and memorable film. The best I've seen this year and one of the best ever! *****/5",10
28 February 2019,An entertaining interesting flick!,"A very well acted drama that makes you feel these characters are real. A very satisfying film filled with an interesting plot and interesting characters.

3 May 2013,The Vidiot Reviews,"Silver Linings Playbook

The easiest way to tell if you're still crazy after being released from a mental hospital is if your imaginary friends throw you a welcome home party.

Luckily, actual people receive the bipolar outpatient in this dramedy.

Discharged after a stint, Pat (Bradley Cooper) arrives home to find his wife has a restraining order against him.

Living with his parents (Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro), he formulates a plan to win her back.

Helping him in the process is Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a deranged widow who needs a dance partner in trade.

But when a binary bet pairs their recital with the Philadelphia Eagles, Pat's recuperation is threatened.

A charismatic comedy combined with a neurotic love story, Silver Linings Playbook plays host to a horde of hysterical performances and madcap chemistry.

Incidentally, the hardest adjustment to life outside of a mental health facility is administering your own electric shock therapy.

15 August 2017,Well-done dramedy,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows as Pat Solitano, Jr.'s (Bradley Cooper) return to his football-obsessed family following an eight month stint in a mental health facility for bipolar disorder. He 'meets cute' with Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who is dealing with her own mental issues following the death of her husband, and the rest of the film follows their developing relationship. Well-written and uniformly well-acted, the film (and presumably the source-material) does a fine job in superimposing a light-weight romantic comedy (which could have been lifted out of innumerable 30's musicals) over the complexities and difficulties of dealing with mental health. I have no immediate experience with bipolar disorder but I thought that Cooper's portrayal of an unstable man fixated on his ex-wife was excellent. DeNiro's superstitious football-bookie father was a great character (and proves that the legendary actor need not do any ""Dirty Grampa"" sequels to remain employed).

11 January 2013,524th Review: Easily the best rom-com of 2012 and better than that,"SLP is a very well-judged, beautifully acted and just plain entertaining slice of rom-com. With an outstanding ensemble team this

works - it entertains, and uncommonly for a rom-com, it makes us use our brains and not just out hearts.

The two damaged protagonists are just the right side of crazy, more deeply heartbroken and mad at it than psychiatrically gone, and as we share their journey we do so taking a little of ourselves with them.

This really is one of my favorite films of the year - and it stands out by a mile in the cinema as being a film about the pursuit of happiness whereas we have a decade of maudlin films this mixes the sorrow and the joy just right.

SLP is worth seeing for the performances and the killer script alone, but it is how it lingers after that will get you. Good movie.",9
6 February 2013,"Little Romance, Little Comedy, Lots of Bad Behavior","First off, I'm 75 years old. Second, I know zero about the two leading performers, so they get no points from me for being ""stars."" Their performances were accomplished and subtle, but IMHO they were playing ugly characters: rude, vulgar, lots of foul language and bad behavior, mistreating and abusing each other. Maybe they were depicting a clinical condition accurately or brilliantly, but that ain't entertainment to me. I just feel offended and roughed up. Incidentally, I am an NFL fan and I think the characterizations in that department were surely intended as parody or farce, but if that's the case then that whole plot mechanism is out of sync with the rest of the film.

7 March 2017,The Comedy Shines First and Foremost,"If, while watching ""Silver Linings Playbook"", you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart. If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.

For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi- polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large. This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle. It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.

At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life. If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level. Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high. The moral of the story is that we are all a little ""screwed up"" on some level, but we just need to find that ""silver lining"" to get through life. Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.

Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads. Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.

Overall, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic. It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.",7

22 May 2020,Very good Movie,"Holy Crap. I put off watching this for about 20 times before I finally broke down and watched it. I expected some stupid, typical romantic comedy, but this was far more than that. Performances are great. Chemistry is right. Dialogue is good. If you want a clinical expose on bipolar disorder, then this might not be right for you. There were enough funny moments and touching moments to make this work, and enough twists to make it original. I'm surprised there are so many highly negative reviews on here. Jennifer did great! (I seriously doubt she's a jogger, but that gets a pass.)

12 June 2022,This is probably my favorite Russell film.,"I love the dance this movie sets up between hope and melancholy; the perfect Christmas-movie theme and tone - should be an annual viewing! The performances pop like crazy, the collection of characters each proving that Pat and Tiffany aren't the only ones with mental disorders. They've become the scapegoats in their respective situations as they fulfill their assigned roles in their family systems. And THAT is what actually brings them together.

1 April 2014,Lighthearted drama with heavy themes,"Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mental institution patient who has just gotten released and now has to re-enter society while avoiding the pitfalls that landed him in the institution in the first place. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend, who has also gone through her own problems and, like Pat, is still dealing with them. Throw in some quirky family members, an overarching goal in the form of a dance competition, some football, and you have Silver Linings Playbook.

Now, what makes this film work is the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence and the sheer talent they bring to their roles. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her role and it shows. Tiffany is a brilliant mixture of varying characteristics. She's a bit manic, she's a bit of a goth, she has her bitchy moments, but beneath all of it you can see the cheerful and caring person she could be. Full of nuances and personality, she's a great character. Not that Cooper does any worse in his role. The film dedicates more time to Pat, him being the main character, and especially the first few scenes, when he's at his most vulnerable, are very effective in introducing his character and getting us to sympathize with him, while still providing some humour.

The story itself isn't overly complex or anything you haven't seen before, but it doesn't really need to be. Romantic comedies/dramas like this one are always more about the characters than plot, so I wasn't expecting anything more. And the story is decent, don't get me wrong. It allows for some nice character moments, some nice dialogue and it carries the movie to a satisfying conclusion. Could it have been better? Yes, but that's a nitpick. No film is perfect.

I'd easily recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies/dramas and to anyone who likes strong and layered characters.",6
24 March 2013,a Philadelphia story,"Knowing Philly and having lived there I got an immediate satisfaction from the familiar atmosphere and settings, right down to De Niro's character planning on opening a cheese-steak restaurant!

Aside from this personal note, I loved Silver Linings Playbook, it seems very much a companion piece to The Fighter in structure and tone (if you can look beyond the difference in genre: sport movie and romantic comedy/musical comedy).

It's funny, upsetting, honest and romantic. The actors are adorable, the whole story takes you in and has you rooting for the characters in a very down-to-earth way.

We are all vulnerable little beings with breakable hearts and this is one from the heart. Thank you for the contagious optimism and hope to everyone who made this film.

3 April 2018,A Review of Mental Illness Representation in Silver Linings Playbook,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
12 January 2013,More Mature Than the Book,"I have recently read the book by Matthew Quick, admittedly in preparation for watching this movie. While the book had a decidedly child-like tone being told in Pat's mentally-disturbed point of view, this movie is a lot more dramatic and serious in tone. The romantic comedy is still in there, but this film is more mature than the book.

From the onset, you already knew that this was not going to be an exact depiction of the book. A lot of changes were noted in the transition from book to film. For some reason, the surname of Pat's family was changed from Peoples to Solitano for some reason. The tune Pat hates was changed from the really cheesy ""Songbird"" by Kenny G to the less cheesy ""My Cherie Amour"" by Stevie Wonder. All the football stories in the book were summarized into one tailgate party scene in the parking lot of the Philadelphia Eagles' stadium.

The story progression and development and the climax is totally different from the book but decidedly more effective cinematically. These changes made were in no way insulting or disappointing to the fans of the book. It did lead to an ending we have seen so many times before in several a romantic comedy in a scene not even in the book. But for the sake of the goodwill built up by the very effective chemistry of the two charismatic lead stars, audiences will love it and cheer.

It is truly remarkable that a romantic comedy could garner nominations in the top 5 Oscar categories and then some. Aside from Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (adapted), this film had the rare distinction of having a nominee in ALL 4 ACTING categories!

While I read the book, I already had Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in my mind in their respective roles as Pat and Tiffany. While I can fully imagine Cooper as Pat, I simply cannot imagine Jennifer as Tiffany. However, while watching the film, Jennifer could not have been a more apt choice. She pulls off this very mature role convincingly with a ferocity and sexiness heretofore only hinted at in ""X-Men First Class.""

Bradley Cooper so far we remember only for his stupid ""Hangover"" movies. He gave us a glimpse of his acting versatility in ""Limitless"" in 2011. But this role as Pat seemed to have been written with him in mind. He had embodied this role of the troubled bipolar guy to a perfect T. He remains likable despite his condition, as Pat was in the book. As portrayed by Cooper, audiences will root for this guy.

While the book had a more dominant role of Pat's Mom, Jacki Weaver had to take a backseat to Robert de Niro in the meatier role of Pat's Dad. Ms. Weaver can count herself lucky to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as her role had been considerably edited in the final screen version. Glad to see De Niro back in good comic form as Pat's supportive Dad. As originally written, Pat's Dad hardly had any dialog nor much to do. I guess this role was rewritten to deserve the talent of the actor they signed for it.

As for its quest to be the first contemporary romantic comedy since ""Annie Hall"" (1977) to win best picture, I do not think that is completely impossible. However, win or no, this movie will be a favorite of many audiences, even for guys only forced by their significant others to watch with them. It will make you feel good and smile when you leave the theater, and that is what we all like.",9

21 January 2013,Block out the Oscar hype and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you.,"As Sigmund Freud said, ""One is very crazy when in love."" Silver Linings Playbook delivers a little less than what its title suggests, but as a romantic comedy, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Adapted from Matthew Quick's novel, this film by David O. Russell (The Fighter, I ♥ Huckabees) shines as a date movie.

Bradley Cooper leads with familiar, sun-kissed energy that made him the stereotypical guy-next-door in chick flicks (The Hangover I & II, Valentines Day) and Jennifer Lawrence flexes elegant moves in a genre new to her filmography (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) but in Silver Linings Playbook, the real show-stopper turns out to be Papa DeNiro.

Pat Junior (Cooper) is bipolar and after eight months in a treatment facility, leaves to recover at his folks. Despite the bad run with his estranged wife (that landed him there in the first place), Pat still loves her and believes that conquering his psychological demons will win her back. Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow nursing old wounds and idiosyncrasies of her own. Sparks fly when both meet at a party thrown by Pat's BFF (played with finely tuned sensitivity by the underrated John Ortiz).

This is not an odd romantic pairing; but the emotional vicissitudes demanded of Pat's role seem to fall short in its rough-hewn delivery and thus, weakening mental health themes in the finished film. Fortunately, the silver lining lies in a strong lineup of supporting cast and Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) shines as an un-diagnosed OCD with eccentric (but believably instinctive) ground rules about ""good and bad jujus"".

Bulk of the film's humor and depth (premised on psychological anxiety) comes from DeNiro and it comes as a delightful surprise. I would love to see a sequel or TV-series patterned after his breakout performance in this film--spin-off of sorts. As Pat's father, the idea that some of his neuroses may have imprinted on Pat adds a natural layer to the subplot-- father and son dynamics.

At the end of Silver Linings Playbook, I left the cinema believing it was written with a heartfelt message nestled in its narrative. But the output fell short, thus inviting criticisms about exaggerating stereotypes for the sake of a few laughs. The mental health industry has also responded with comments about inaccurate portrayals of bipolar behavior.

But like I said; for date movie material, it dazzles as cookie-cutter romcom (with an edge).

Block out the Oscar hype (nominated in eight categories) and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you. This feel good comedy is an entertaining peal of laughs and it stands on its own merits.

2 January 2013,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this movie but was very disappointed. If the issue of mental illness is supposed to be one of the central themes of the film, why couldn't the production staff figure out something simple such as the pronunciation of the drug Trazadone? The drug is not pronounced TRAY-ZO-DONE but TRAAZ-A-DONE. I would expect a large budget film to have some fact-checking in place.

Secondly, the mental illness theme was never fleshed out. The Bradley Cooper character appeared to have a temper but no real mental illness. Jennifer Lawrence was slightly quirky but no more unusual than a typical young adult.

Comning from a family with bipolar and unipolar depression and borderline personalities, I have an idea of what mental illness looks like and this was not it.

Lastly, the film was trying too hard to be too many things. Was it a romantic comedy or a drama or something else? Disappointing movie.",4
5 December 2012,"Hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming","Bradley Cooper characteristically charms in David O. Russell's hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming story about an asylum-dodging manic depressive who eventually finds a silver lining.

Pat (Cooper) radically alters his lifestyle, even promises to manage his anger without medication, in the quixotic hope of reuniting with his cheating wife. But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow and self-confessed loose woman who challenges Pat's assumptions about her, leading to an unbreakable friendship. Lawrence's headstrong performance I hope ensures her career will not be mired by the monstrosity that is the 'Hunger Games' series.

Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are noteworthy as Pat's parents, especially De Niro who gives a rare performance requiring emotional depth and comedic flair. With a film this impressive, it isn't necessary to mention that Danny Elfman composed the score (but he did).

However derivative O. Russell's script (based on a novel by Matthew Quick) becomes, I cannot condemn any of it. It is transcended by acting that is so honest, you find yourself focusing not on the clichés but on cheering for Pat. The poignancy in his quest to win back his wife frankly had me almost blubbering.

If ever there was a film to illustrate Joni Mitchell's famous line about not knowing what you have until it's gone, this was it.",8
2 October 2013,Mental illness looks like a lot of fun,"I enjoyed the movie the way I like reading secretly ""People"" magazine as a sort of escapism but then feeling guilty that common sense lost a battle over knowledge of mundane details of real life. But after the movie had ended, I realized that it was just another example of surrendering my sense of realism to tricky ways of enternteintment industry - and its ingenious ways of manipulating even more sophisticated audience into believing that serious matters need only a layer of honey and all will be be good at the end. I admit that the movie was fun to watch for its quirky humor and eccentric characters, but was it a realistic description of mental illness? I dare say that not. Actually I think that being mental case looked in this movie like a lot of fun. You are crazy but there are still lots of people around you although in real life families and friends slowly leave you. In the movie our main characters are supported by many family members and friends - the idea I cannot buy easily seeing so many lonely, crazy people living on streets. And what about hard realities of life such as money? He is in a mental hospital for months, has a very patient psychiatrist(only in movies)and have no problem obtaining medicine which is quite expensive in USA. Who is paying for all of that? He has no insurance after being fired and his family doesn't look rich to me. And another perk of being a crazy person according to movie: you really don't have to look for work in this lousy economy ; you get off the hook because after all - you are crazy and nobody expect anything of you. What a relief! And you still are able to do all those funny things like going to games,participating in dance contests, living in nice places, meeting easily new love interest- and a quite hot one. Well, if mental problems are like that I wish to be put on the list of candidates. It certainly beats our mundane, boring lives and constant worries about jobs,children, pensions, getting old.ill and poor. Well, dear viewer - it is like that: a lot of mentally ill people end up on streets, neither get proper treatment nor medicine; many families reject them as too much of a problem to handle. So watch the movie as something to do on a boring winter night if you need some fun but don't believe it. Life isn't like that. If you really need to watch movie about realities of being crazy and living with a crazy person - watch ""A woman under the influence"" directed by John Cassavetes with Gena Rowlands as a crazy housewife and Peter Falk playing her husband. That's how life really looks like when you suffer from mental illness - not fun at all.",5
5 February 2013,Why is this nominated for Oscars?,"How this film has got such high reviews I do not know! This is a laughable attempt at depicting mental illness, Bradley coopers role as a person suffering from bipolar disorder is probably one of the worst representations of someone suffering from a mental health issue that I have ever seen. The film is so predictable that i didn't even finish watching it as i was so bored, but willing to bet that i can guess how it ended. Do not waste you time or money watching this film. This film actually makes me want to sue David o Russell for wasting 1.30 hrs of my life that I will never get back. (Notice it is only an hour and a half, this is because I gave up giving this film a chance to redeem itself after this period of time). I have seen some bad films in my life, and this one is now one of the top 10.

23 September 2013,Hard to see why it's so loved,"Watched the film with my other half as thought this would be a good rom com with a different theme, however by half way through I wasn't sure if my wife wanted to continue or switch it off. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the film doesn't dealt with mental illness very we'll, however I'm not sure that was the point of the film in the fist place. The first half was just a bit boring, some slightly amusing parts but not much else in the comedy department. The romance never feels like a romance as the connection between the two leads just doesn't fit properly. The performances from Mr Cooper and Miss Lawrence are very good and it has to be said I think they save this entire movie from being a total turkey. The last 20 minutes has some good tension as they approach the competition, it's just all a bit too much like hard work getting there and staying with it. Worth a watch but not worth much else.

8 October 2015,Crazy meets Crazy!,"I enjoyed watching Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as two broken unstable people. He is separated from his wife after the incident. She lost her husband and went sex crazed in her office. As Pat, Cooper does a terrific believable job in portraying him with his mental illness. As Tiffany, Lawrencr won a well deserved Academy Award for best actress. I thought she should have been won for ""The Hunger Games"" but she deserved it anyway. Here Lawrence shows why she won as well with a realistic portrayal of a grieving widow. I love Jacki Weaver as the supportive loving mother. She earned her second Oscar nomination. She is a such a great actress. Robert DeNiro plays the dad and did a wonderful job as always. The film was shot on location in Philadelphia area. The Eagles scene was realistic and football is more American than Apple pie. The film is a heartwarming love story.

19 January 2013,"Boring, Depressing, Predicable","After a half hour I was looking a my watch every 10 minutes. Then I started realizing that all these dysfunctional mental cases were just making me depressed. I kept trying to find something redeeming about this movie -- after all, it is so highly acclaimed. But, frankly I could not wait for it to be over. Walking out was out of the question because my wife would have been impossible to live with for days. And it wasn't because it was a ""chick flick"" or because there were no car crashes or aliens with exploding heads. It was because, frankly, these acclaimed actors had a crappy script to work with. The story just went on and on and had no place to go. It was the longest 2 hours I ever spent. Save your money.

24 March 2013,This movie sucks!,"I don't know what people love this movie so much and I think it's way too over-rated. I mean Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress, and Robert D Niro, Bradley Cooper, they are great too. But the thing is, the story itself it's plain boring and it's way to slow! Like very very very very slow!!! I don't understand why people are analyzing it way to deeply and enjoying this slow movie! I hate it, i didn't hate it before, but people were appreciating it way too much which I think this movie doesn't deserve, so I hate it now. The basic idea for this movie is plain simple, just lots of yelling and predictable ending, so I don't understand why people love this so much.

18 June 2013,Completely overrated,"I had to watch this film twice in a row to try and understand (and I'm still lost) as to where the hype, and the endless award nominations came from. Maybe without all the hype I would have been less disappointed, but it's still, to me, a film not worth watching. I was expecting it to be different from other typical American rom coms, but I was wrong. I haven't got anything against American rom coms, I just never really rate them highly. What made silver linings especially disappointing for me is that the portrayal of mental illness (which was the part of the story that made me want to see it) was awful. Whether it be bad acting or a poor narrative, but without the talk of mental illness, I wouldn't have even been aware that mental illness existed in the movie. You'd honestly just think the characters had poor social skills or maybe some milder form of a learning disability, such as asbergers, but certainly not bi-polar or any other serious mental health conditions. And this makes me really wonder where the Oscar nominations came from? I've never been more puzzled? Don't get lost in the hype, the film was extremely average, along with the acting.",5
20 January 2014,So much better than a 5!,"I've heard some harsh criticism of David O. Russell and his direction of several movies lately. This had me expecting this movie to be a 5 but it is so much more than that. The writing and the direction are both incredible. David O. Russell had his hands on both. The David O. Russell movies I have seen so far have all been very good and I am not sure I agree with some of the criticism I have heard lately. This movie is an example of how great he is at taking something written and adapting it into a well crafted, witty screenplay. Then he translates that onto the screen and achieves a movie that I will not soon forget.

I will get the few negatives out of the way first and create a review positive / negative / positive sandwich.

The major problem I had with this movie is John Ortiz and quite frankly that isn't even close to the next worst part. Ortiz plays the character of Ronnie. Ronnie is a man who is stressed out because his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) demands that her life be perfect and that she gets whatever she desires or he is afraid that she will leave him. Veronica's harsh character fuels Ronnie's stress to the point of needing someone to vent to so that he will not freak out in front of her. This is why Ronnie ends up venting to Pat (Bradley Cooper). Ronnie is a clown. He is distracting and tries way too hard to be funny. Ortiz's delivery of every line is quite annoying and I am not sure why David O. Russell let this Jim Carrey-esk overacting performance pollute what could have been a near perfect presentation from just about every character on screen. It may have even been highlighted as a result of him being surrounded by a group of actors nailing it in every scene. Such a shame.

The only other issue I had with the movie was some plot holes and cheesy moments but those were easily overlooked due to the strength of the acting and the story as a whole.

You can tell a good script by how information is delivered to the viewer and Silver Linings Playbook was one of those movies that everyone should see just for that aspect of it. The way they deliver information about characters and who has certain relationships with others isn't by saying ""you're my dad"" or ""I'm your brother"" but it is cleverly disguised by psychiatric evaluation in therapy of Pat. As the movie progresses, you learn more and more information about these troubled characters. Each character has their own issues and development but each character needs the other characters to be able to grow, cope with tough situations and develop further. Lastly, the comedy in this movie is dark and at times subtle but it worked so well for me as I was laughing at many of the situations each character was involved in.

I loved this movie even with its few flaws. It was great to see Chris Tucker on the big screen again as he made his triumphant return. This is a great date movie as it has sports and cheesy moments all wrapped up in one package. Just don't watch this one with a new relationship as there are some aspects that are not first date friendly.",7
22 November 2012,Leave the cinema with a smile for a change?,"Hectic rather than dramatic; charming rather than funny; and as for romance, that would be somewhat of an insult on behalf of one of this year's finer films. Silver Linings Playbook leads rather than follows an off-beat style for its genre. Scratch that, you gather the sense that it advocates its own genre due to its uniquely complex characters and relationships, yet with a simplistic and easy to follow narrative.

The most perplexing scenario when engaged in the theatrical experience is how much we, the audience, are energised by these rather peculiar characters. Each conveys some form of dysfunctional behaviour, whether it is some mental incapacity, an obsession or lying to one's self. Nevertheless, they are extraneously relatable which formulates a wonderful character-audience relationship simultaneously. One can imagine the ease in which the independent studio could have sensationalised the relationships, or added the dreaded cheese factor to this delightful November release. As it turns out, we were instead gifted with this grounded, rounded earth of a film, by which I mean complete as a whole in its entirety. Once the final shot transits to the rolling credits, we feel we require no more from the two hours of pleasurable endurance, whilst also being unable to identify a single flaw, which proves evident in the countless smiling faces (including your own) around the theatre and uplifted mood around the room. The primary cause for this 'Silver Lining Theory' (Bharat Samra trademark) is undoubtedly the combination of an evidently well-written script and truly tremendous acting. The amalgamation of seemingly authentic and convincing dialogue blended with the two phenomenal lead actors and numerous noteworthy supporting actors is what fuels the picture into a smooth journey up a straight path, with some bumps along the way to enable our protagonist to maintain and test his fortitude.

One of the aspects of the film which as a viewer you hugely appreciate is lack of condescension. You learn so much about each individual character that there is no need to be continuously reminded of what is occurring in the narrative, as you become so immersed into their lives and behaviours, you almost instantly adopt their personalities, meaning we can assume their actions, and the motion picture's integrity does not yield, yet increases with confluent storytelling. Each actor involved with this production warrants copious acclaim as their influential authority over their roles are not for a second doubted, as they own their part so reliably well. Most conspicuously, the leads in Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are foremost worth valuing due to their, excuse the following cliché, on screen chemistry. Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker are also sensationally suited for this film, for their opposing roles. Tucker not surprisingly assists in the comedic department comfortably, while De Niro vents an irrational, confused and a times angry father to Cooper's character Pat due to his OCD.

I believe this to be one of the rare contemporary cinematic releases that compels throughout. It has heart, humour, hedonism and happiness, though you may as times witness the interfamily conflict, the restoration of happiness is, inevitable. The fact that not a lot actually happens in this independent film can be disregarded because it is the characters and their dialogue which carries the picture perhaps into further future award winning territory, to add to the already achieved accolades. Silver Linings Playbook is suitable for almost any demographic, assuming you are indeed above the age of consent for this particular picture, I can almost guarantee enjoyment and pleasure for at least the two hour duration, and even long after the screening, especially the climactic, quite simply fun dance sequence, along with even learning the implication of the terrific title.",8
19 September 2022,Great,"The best from David O. Russell and probably my favourite rom-com, I must say.

The screenplay is so clever. It wants to introduce us to two main leads but the first 25 minutes are to introduce only one of them and we will get pieces about the other during the rest of the film in such an effortless way.

The acting is magnificent. I don't get some hate for Lawrence here, she is great. As great as Cooper and De Niro. Brilliant performances from all the cast and probably the most focused work by O. Russell in the direction.

Even if sometimes it seems very simple, the film has so much to say about difference, guilt, relationships and new beginnings that is totally impossible to feel empty at the end.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker.

4 February 2014,My cherie amour,"Bradley Cooper has a ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in this 2012 film directed by David O. Russell and also starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro.

Delores Solatano brings her bipolar son Pat Jr. home from a mental health institution, although it's not recommended by the doctors. She also didn't tell her husband, Pat Solatano Sr., who is now a bookie.

Pat Jr.'s history is checkered due to his illness. A former teacher, he came home one day and found his wife Nikki in the shower with another teacher while ""My Cherie Amour"" played on the stereo. He beat the man to a pulp. His wife has a restraining order against him. Pat Jr. is now in mandatory therapy but refuses to take his medication because it makes him foggy. He thinks exercise and good health are the way to go. The first time he goes to the psychiatrist's office, ""My Cherie Amour"" is playing in the reception room, and Pat trashes it.

One night he looks for his wedding video and can't find it. He wakes his mother up, which wakes his father up -- and ultimately the entire neighborhood and the police.

Delusional, Pat believes that if he gets in good physical shape, which he is doing, adopts a positive attitude and always looks for the ""silver linings,"" his wife will come back to him.

One night at a friend's house for dinner, he meets a widow and recovering sex addict, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). After a rocky beginning, Pat asks Tiffany if she will deliver a letter to Nikki. She will, on the condition that he is her dance partner in an upcoming contest. He reluctantly agrees.

This is a wonderful, entertaining movie with heartfelt performances by all involved. The film shows the difficulty in dealing with bipolar illness not just for the person who has it, but the whole family, and how in some ways it has ripped them apart. So there is healing needed for the entire family.

I remember when Bradley Cooper was on Alias. He was a cute young leading man with a pleasant personality who had obviously been picked up by a top agency, as he started showing up in movies. It turns out that he has a tremendous talent. His performance here is very honest as a man always on the edge who fights for control and is determined to meet his goals. ""You have to have a strategy,"" his therapist (Anupam Kehr) keeps telling him. Kehr is excellent as Pat's low-key therapist.

Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as Tiffany -- some people don't like her acting style, which is very overt, but I do. She is very intense, I'll grant you, but she plays a woman with lots of challenges. Robert De Niro is superb as Pat Sr., with an OCD personality who has trouble communicating with his problem son.

Chris Tucker is Pat's friend from the institution who keeps discharging himself and getting picked up by the police and taken back. He's hilarious. Finally, Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother is delightful - a loving woman trying to reconcile father and son and keep the peace.

While some people found the ending formulaic, I loved it. I'm a sucker, so sue me.

A warm film, well directed.",8

1 April 2013,Bipolarity,"You're always glad, when you find a intelligent comedy, after having watched too many idiotic, semi-idiotic and quarter-idiotic ones. But is it really a comedy? Many things go around under the surface of the heroes.

You've heard and seen much from Tracy/Hepburn, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are better. They can both explode any second and you can't say when they are happy or miserable, which makes them like something arriving from a thing called life.

The only thing which maybe degrades this a little are the almost slapstick scenes we have here with Robert De Niro. There's no need for it in this heavy drama.

21 November 2012,Find your silver lining.,"I am willing to admit that Jennifer Lawrence was the primary reason I went to watch this, for both the acclaim she was getting for her performance, and since she's absolutely gorgeous. Since I have been scouting out some movies for the award season, I would have seen it anyway, but it would not have been nearly as good without her, or without anyone for that matter. This is what perfect casting is in a movie, and it is much more rare than it seems. Bradley Cooper, Shea Wigham and Robert De Niro play a great father and sons with all the dysfunction yet undeniable love for each other. I absolutely loved everything about the movie, and definitely plan on buying it. But for now, I must away and tell everyone to watch this movie.

12 January 2013,Great performances,"This film is about a man with bipolar disorder, who finds sanity and hope in life through a quirky woman.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" tells the life of a young man, whose life is shattered before he meets a quirky woman called Tiffany. Through a series of constructive activities, they both find meaning and hope. I think the two main characters are very well portrayed. They are magnetic and fascinating in their own way. I really like the way that both of them find healing and solace from each other. It is a comforting and satisfying scenario. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both act well, making their characters so alive and convincing. It is a pity that Jacki Weaver's role is so small, I think it is a bit of a waste of a great actress. Overall, I think ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film with great performances.

5 October 2013,A Sound Tale of Unsound Characters.,"A sound tale of two unsound characters, Silver Linings Playbook is a tightly structured & wonderfully scripted film by David O. Russell which manages to work on the better side of the silver lining between predictably boring & predictably interesting and the one thing which made sure that happens is the overall performances by its entire cast.

The story concerns a former school teacher named Pat who, after his stint at a medical institution, moves back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife & get his life back. But all his plans soon go for a toss when he meets Tiffany, a girl with problems of her own, as the two embark on a love/hate friendship based solely on their own selfish reasons.

David O. Russell's direction smoothly covers the evolution of its two lead characters & the film presents a fine balance between its elements of comedy, drama & romance. Although everyone has finely contributed in the acting department, the most impressive work comes from Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence in what is arguably the finest performances of their careers, so far.

Predictable yet interesting, hilarious yet dramatically moving & presented in fragments yet managing to remain quite stable throughout its runtime, Silver Linings Playbook is a delightful rom-com that's nicely directed, lively scripted, elegantly composed & energetically performed by its cast & crew to deliver an entertainment worthy of your time & money.",

28 March 2013,Great disappointment. Not at all like the book.,"It is unfair towards the book, Silver Linings Playbook, to call this movie by the same name. It is not at all the alike and every single character's personality is completely different from the original text. The story had been edited to suit the needs of the mainstream, superficial movie goer.

The movie is predictable whereas the book isn't at all. The movie is devoid of any deep, real feelings, whereas the book is filled with it. The movie is more suitable for extroverts and the book more suitable for introverts. The book would help you to get to know the main character much better.

Do yourself a favour: switch the screen off and go read the book. It is brilliant...unlike the movie.

28 July 2013,Not only a great Rom-Com but a Fantastic Movie,"Whenever i think of the genre of romantic comedy what springs to mind is a cheesy film with a load of same old same old actors that are there for the pay packet, and after the film is finished you don't even remember the characters names. This Movie is a cut above the rest, i was worried that the big names would kill the films soul but it only fueled it. I did not remember i was watching a film the whole way through i thought i was just observing the fascinating lives of Tiffany and Pat, the characters were built and portrayed so perfectly that they were almost like these weren't actors these were real people.

Where the story makes itself for me is in the style it is created with great emphasis on emotion and portrayed the mental illness of the characters perfectly. there was no lack of depth in the film and it felt like 2hours of breathtaking because the film was astounding.

Many people criticise the Oscars for some of the awards it has given out, but in my opinion anyone who criticises them for awarding best actress to Jennifer Lawrence is clearly blind. I have to say that Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany was an absolute perfect casting decision because she is arguably right now one of the greatest actresses on the planet and if anyone disagrees then maybe they should watch this film and Winter's Bone because for a girl that had no acting classes she is phenomenal. The way she blends between sanity and mental illness in this film is impeccable you will not even notices it because from the first moment you meet her you have already forgot that its Jennifer Lawrence from the hunger games and engrossed yourself in the world of silver linings playbook, only great actors can pull that off and i have to say that this performance puts her down as a great.

Bradley Cooper was also stunning in the film i was worried that his humorous side would make him lose track of his character but boy was i wrong. honestly if it wasn't for Daniel Day-Lewis performance in Lincoln then i believe Bradley Cooper would have an Oscar right now too. Humor is seen at sometimes but only when necessary this is a very serious performance from Cooper and it is probably his best performance to date.

I could go on and on about the great characters and the astounding directing but i will simply end with the statement that this is the best Romantic Comedy i have ever seen. 10/10",10
12 January 2013,A Nutshell Review: Silver Linings Playbook,"One of the films that received the largest number of Oscar nominations for this year's edition of the Academy Awards, Silver Linings Playbook is one uplifting film in a long while, centered around a bipolar disorder sufferer released from an institution after eight months, to reunite with family and friends. Director David O. Russell trades the boxing gloves in The Fighter for romance, keeping the triumph of the human spirit as one of the themes in this film filled with hope that all good things come to those who persevere.

While some may balk at the lead pairing of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence for their age gap, they blow away their critics sharing great chemistry and acting craft opposite each other, that you'd root for their characters to overcome several obstacles placed in their way that threatens to tear apart the good things they share, despite spending most of the time bickering with one another, sometimes due to the fact of their bluntness and directness

Bradley Cooper plays Pat, who suffers from bipolar disorder and got into trouble with the law when he discovers his wife's infidelity, Now out of a mental institution, he has a loose strategy of gaining back his life based on constant exercise and therapy, while finding himself having to spend time with his dad Pat Sr (Robert De Niro) who is trying his best to reconnect with his son through football, and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of his friend's wife (Julia Stiles), who has the means to serve as his conduit to wife Nikki (Brea Bee), who had served a restraining order on him.

Much of the scenes here naturally gravitate toward the broken souls of Pat and Tiffany, which forms the main bulk of the story given their awkward nature toward each other, that slowly grows on you. With Pat, we witness his manic attacks when the right buttons and triggers get pushed, trying his best to keep some sane semblance of a life without inconveniencing his family, while Tiffany battles from depression, as well as a rotten reputation of being the village bicycle of sorts after losing her husband. It's a tale about two broken people having to find strength in each other, and to continue identify and acknowledge the good in the people who have hurt them, and it grows on you emotionally.

What made David O. Russell's work stand out, boiled down to the excellent casting, and eventual delivery by the actors involved. Bradley Cooper shows off his acting chops here without needing to be overly melodramatic, playing a man obsessed with getting back at his wife, and may be missing the forest for the tree if continue to be obviously blindsided to the attention of another. Jennifer Lawrence had proved before with Winter's Bone that she can handle smaller, more personal roles rather than the commonly rote, big budgeted blockbuster ones from First Class to The Hunger Games, and continues to show why her star is rising, and is one of the best actresses of her generation.

The rest of the ensemble also chipped in with wonderful performances of their own. Robert De Niro is probably the go-to man to play fatherly roles these days, and he doesn't disappoint with his Pat Sr having shown favouritism to his other more successful son. Trying his best to re-connect with Pat Jr, he does so in the only way he knows how, through that of a football game, with stakes raised when he becomes the bookmaker in order to save enough for the opening of a restaurant. Chris Tucker also came in now and then to work his motor-mouth and spew some of the best comical lines in the film, while Jacki Weaver as Pat's mom brings a little touch as any mother character would toward the son, wishing for him to be better, and playing the key role in getting him discharged, to be taken care by family instead.

Cinematography by Japanese Masanobu Takayanagi made Silver Linings Playbook seem a little bit like a documentary with plenty of hand-held scenes, while the soundtrack boasts an eclectic selection, with a score thrown in by Danny Elfman. Then let your heart be charmed by troubled people each seeking out a renewed chance to pick up the pieces in their lives, as well as the underlying romance in the movie. A definite recommendation, and clearly one of the highlights as best film.",10
6 July 2013,Rethinking my own restraining order...,"Honestly, this sat at home for a while as I thought my wife had got the Sandra Bullock mainstream football movie. So the pleasant surprise in finally watching it and realizing my initial mistake gave this an extra boost.

It's a bit different than the typical dysfunctional family drama. In that the leads are aware of their dysfunction and trying with great effort to overcome. It's also different in that it strives to address a serious topic (listen to some of the David O. Kelley recounting of his son's illness on the DVD) but ultimately this is a comedy I feel.

In fact, I'd bet Kelley prides the Hollywood normalcy that the story takes, granted with a circuitous rout at times to find. You won't love this film as much as Kelley loves his son, but still it's worth a watch (I wish my wife could have pushed past some of the rough aspects of the beginning, but alas no...) The key is having these atypical leading characters, sure the ""chase the wrong one"" love story is hackneyed, but here Cooper's character is easily seen as chasing himself and how things were before the incident, rather than really chasing his estranged wife.

There are many precious moments, and DeNiro find a nice supporting role to act up a storm in (too bad they didn't edit out the lines that hamfistedly state the obvious coping strategy and illness that he as the father suffers). But Cooper carries the show (and I thought Chris Tucker shined in his small moments as well). Something about their enthusiastic energy that can be alarmingly charming, but springs forth from darker sources was fascinating. Perhaps no surprise they rose in entertainment as comedians, a career that also feeds off shock and odd angles.

The tone of the film is so accepting, it avoids the crass elements. But doesn't sugarcoat the sour slips. We've all said inappropriate things at times, but as Lawrence's character tells Cooper's, we typically don't say more inappropriate things than appropriate. Thanks to the disease of the film, and the ease of the actors in conveying it, this never feels like an FM shock jock reaching for provocation, just the lack of an emotional and empathetic editor in the consciousness of the two leads.

Anyways, if like me, you want a restraining order for the big commercial successes, I think you can have it lifted for this one.",7
20 October 2016,Shared Oscar,"Jennifer Lawrence should give half of her Oscar to Cooper cause both nailed it. She did earn her Oscar, but she was no better than Bradley, so if she got it, he should get one too.

The movie is a bit sleazy, but despite that, it's really good. I saw it when it was released, now I saw it again and I will watch it more in the future. It's kind of a movie that you can't not love, but you also can not say why exactly do you love it.

I do not like Jennifer Lawrence, but in this movie she simply steals our hearts. Really awesome performance.

2 April 2013,Cringe,"I didn't care for this film. In fairness, I didn't realize it was a romantic comedy. I expected a heavy drama for some reason.

The basics of the storyline are cliché'd, like all RomComs. I couldn't help but suspect that they tacked on the dance scenes to profit from the ""celebrity dancing"" craze currently on television.

I don't think Bradley Cooper is a particularly good actor and I expect him to be doing ""Indie films"" within a couple of years. The scenes with him and the female lead are cringeworthy and lack chemistry.

This isn't a terrible film, but for the life of me I don't understand why it's getting such high ratings. I suppose it's more watchable than your average RomCom, which isn't saying much.

This movie is also very blue collar.",5
2 October 2022,The best romantic comedy for the 21st century,"At least a decent romantic comedy, a romantic comedy with a decent screenplay that is not shallow, a romantic comedy that deserved that oscar award most certainly Jennifer lawrence deserved that Academy Award for best actress.

This movie is groundbreakingly brilliant.

This movie does not involve a hot character instead it involves realistic characters, it does not need sexyness in order to become such a massive success both at the awards and at the box office making triple times its production budget.

Jennifer lawrence was flawless and she was extremely matured taking the Oscar home.

It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships.

30 December 2018,Excelsior! Great actuation and love story,"Is a very simple love movie that combine issues of the day-to-day life but the actuation off all the cast is remarkable. They make you feel the entire movie that they are feeling at that moment. Congratulations for the history and to show how simple steps, words and actions can rebuild a life.

14 January 2018,An unique idea,"After being released from a mental institution and facing a very tight restrain order, a man is determined to get back on his feet and return to his supposedly beloved wife, convinced that she would be waiting for him. Although struggling with his difficult condition, with the help of a new friend, found in a difficult situation of her own, he seems to be capable to do whatever it takes to impress his wife, but, as you might expect, things aren't going to be easy.

We follow his evolution from the moment of his release, how he reintegrates into society, how he deals with his family problems and how he meets a new girl who's about to influence his life more than he could have ever imagined. The relationship of the two is closely described throughout the whole movie, creating an unique atmosphere which keeps you pointed to the screen.

The plot it features is very good, very well thought and very well presented, and with a couple of great characters, excellently played by a bunch of great actors, contribute to a very good watch. It manages to be dramatic, funny and suspenseful with every single scene it presents, facts which make it one of a kind. It's a movie which has a very different idea and develops everything around it, thus it has to be taken as it is and accepted this way. If you can embrace it, you'll find a very good movie which will provide two quality hours of cinematography.

Overall, I found a very good movie, with an unique plot, a couple of excellent characters and some great actors, which ultimately lead to a very satisfying finale. Everything about this movie is very good, no matter how you look at it, but my only regret is that is don't have anything wow, anything that will amaze, or that it would make it truly special.",9
31 March 2013,"Very very bad director, very bad movie, who paid for the critics? :)","..maybe Apple,as there is a little bit too much of the commercial there.

But to be honest,the movie is a crap. Not a catchy story,not funny,very unprofessional camera,cut and directing..

Just concentrate on the shades or cuts during dialogs.

There are even silent parts,where you see an actor from behind and you see that she is talking!,but there is no voice :)..

Terrible,terrible,terrible.Don't waste any penny on it.

And don't believe the reviews with rating above 3.

Maybe someone would say,that this is art. But art should not have that bad camera.",1
7 January 2013,A Terrific Tango of Two Misfits,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

24 August 2013,"ridiculous casting/story, 'solid' production wth!","The idea is nice (silver lining), the craziness is curious, but all in all , just the fact that the movie is completely untrue to life spoils every bit of good production efforts or background ideas. This only makes me think, are all the movies complete worthless bs?

Is neo-neo-realism ever going to show up, are seriously funny / clever comedies /dramas going to show? Why are we fed this cheap artificial s. and are there any actresses that actually look like females that in real life would be obsessed with a crazy looser that could had been cast to play the Tiffany, etc. etc. etc.? Sorry, De Niro, method does not help to play a loser father either...

7 January 2014,I liked it!,"I liked this film, but I do not think it deserves all the awards it was given.

Acting is excellent, what a cast! Dialogue is fast and dynamic! I really enjoyed it.

This film shows well psychiatric illness. It is all too common in your and my neighborhood. Do pills help? In some cases they do.

And why is he running around the neighborhood with a plastic bag on the top of his body? I guess he is crazy! And she was a slut and she is not anymore? Give me a break! If you have someone crazy in your family this is a film for you!

18 March 2013,"I wont say ""good"" or ""Bad""---I will say ""Not A Comedy""","I wasn't going to watch this, but i asked the board about it , and someone said- parts are ""hilarious""..... (my op.)there is nothing hilarious in this movie, I watch a lot of comedy...this movie is in NO sense of the word a comedy ...even a dark comedy

What I got from this movie ""S.L.P"", ""how to deliver funny lines with out being funny"", there are opportunities for hilarity but NEVER capitalized on , every possible funny line is delivered with the highest level of ""deadpan""... it is the straight man delivering the punchlines, which i Have seen work, but not here.

it IS some sort of romance, maybe a good one --i don't review romance--

It IS also a drama, maybe a good one --- i don't review drama--

so , watch it , and you decide..... now just start the movie",3

3 March 2013,My favorite Comedy,"After finding out about this movie months ago I had to wait for it to come out here in the Netherlands. Luckily this almost coincided with the Oscars. I've become a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence after seeing her good performances in Winter's Bone and the Hunger Games and was keen to see her in this movie.

In my humble opinion, this was a deserved win for Jennifer Lawrence in the category Actress in a Leading Role. She portrays the character Tiffany in a fun way. My only concern before seeing the movie was that she might made it too funny, in a way making fun of bipolar. While that was a small concern seeing the director David O. Russel has experienced Bipolar in his family and knows how to handle this subject. you do have to be subtle when basing a movie on a delicate matter. Fortunately, none of this happened and the movie turned out to be a delight.

First off, the acting. The acting in this movie is of good quality. It's not extremely good, but it's definitely viable. Robert de Niro plays a fun role playing the Football-addicted father of Bradley Coopers character. Bradley Coopers character is portrayed in a good way. His reactions to certain situations or sounds are fun to see. While I liked his acting in this movie it's not sublime and i'm happy to see he got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead for me though, with a very good performance in this movie. As I said before, a deserved Oscar winner. The dialogs between Pat and Tiffany(Bradley and Jennifer) are a lot of fun to watch. Their chemistry in this movie is exciting and you can tell they had a lot of fun making this movie.

The story is good. Comedies tend to be a tad predictable, what this movie is too at points but with a comedy it's about the quality of the humor. This movie made me laugh a lot, so it's definitely of good quality when it comes to the humor.

Definitely a recommendation from me if you want to see a fun movie that will make you laugh.",10

1 March 2013,Chaotically Beautiful,"I saw this movie on premiere night in Holland, February 28, and had been anticipating to see it for months. The reviews were full of praise and if the award and nomination count was anything to go by, I knew I would be entertained.

As the movie began I found myself a little confused by the chaos in which director David O. Russell decided to film this movie, but as the story got a shape and I became familiar with the characters I found myself appreciating this way of filming. It was chaotic, but it was beautiful. A perfect nod to the state of mind Pat and Tiffany must have been.

This movie is one that deals with mental disorder, which are no laughing feat, but Pat's inability to be sensitive with his words and Tiffany's bluntness when talking about her past make you laugh out loud on many occasions. Soon enough you find yourself caring for these characters. For Pat, because he tries so hard, but is facing a family and a community that at first does not really believe in his recovery. And for Tiffany, because she is the kind of girl to do something for others without expecting anything in return. The movie throws memorable lines at you early on and you will be pleasantly surprised to see that events or comments from the beginning come back in the end.

This is not a movie you should go see if you wish to sit back and not think for a good two hours. Though it will surely be enjoyable and a good watch, I believe you cannot truly appreciate the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook if you do not take the time to analyze the characters and their actions. From Pat Junior to Pat Senior and even to Jake: Pat's brother, whose life is the complete opposite of Pat's.

Despite the nature of the film, dealing with mental disorders and all, it is a feel good movie that will have you looking for the silver linings in your own life.",9

18 March 2013,Two films in one,"I found there to be two films within this film. One worked better than the other.

The first half of the film worked better for me. There was a veritable tension as we decide if Bradley Cooper's character is still crazy or not. The film didn't rely on silly plot triggers in this half of the film.

The second half fell into too many pitfalls. I cannot see for the life of me see why there had to be so many secondary characters. Not a single one of them worked and the gags seemed tired. I've seen the Indian guy stereotype cutting loose at least five times in other films. What did the black character bring to the film? The brother subplot underdeveloped and I'm forgetting even more secondary characters..This film did not need to explore to it's depths these characters and whatever tension that was established in the beginning quickly fizzled away as we followed pointless subplots created from space ie; the dance competition and betting.

The film was also too long and a bit of cutting/editing and winding up some scenes quicker than they were would have added a greater vigor to the film. However, I enjoyed myself throughout the film and did not want it to end.

The absolute shining light is clearly Bradley Cooper, every other character cannot hold a candle to him. His female counterpart was particularly grating and painful to watch. Hats off to Bradley as he carried this film on his shoulders and it's a performance hauntingly difficult to forget.",6

3 March 2013,"An engaging, witty and heart warming story","Among the new releases over this holiday season was quirky comedy/drama Silver Linings Playbook. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DiNero, the offbeat comedy has swept this year's awards with major nominations for Oscars and Golden Globes; it even managed to snag a best lead actress globe for Jennifer Lawrence at last week's ceremony. The story centers on Pat (Cooper), a teacher who has to move back in with his parents after a stint in a mental institution, Pat suffers from bipolar disorder and is trying to get his life back on track by getting fit and reconciling with his wife, but like any good comedy, this does not go to plan. Pat's football obsessed family want to help him get his life together, but once he meets young widow Tiffany (Lawrence), things start to go awry. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but in return she asks him to be her partner in a local dancing competition.

Silver Linings Playbook had the potential to be your regular romcom, but thanks to its somewhat controversial theme and excellent casting, it effortlessly avoids this. Instead, viewers are treated to character driven plot that is filled out with a mix of tense and hilariously awkward scenes that make the film incredibly enjoyable. The ending is the only predictable aspect of the film, but it's a satisfying one as the characters you were rooting for get what they deserve.

From the get go, Silver Linings Playbook is clever, engaging and heart- warming, both Cooper and Lawrence give outstanding performances that make their characters not just likable, but believable too, and an all- star supporting cast including Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker give the story more layers. A film about mental illness, dancing and American football might sound slightly strange, but it's the strangeness of this film that makes it so good, and a shoe in for at least one Oscar this year.",7

This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",4
6 December 2012,A Rom Com that guys can love,"I must admit that I was a bit wary at first of whether or not I would see Silver Linings Playbook. Being a New Yorker and a member of NYGiants nation my first take on seeing the trailer for this film was that it would be a fantasy tale for Eagledelphia in which the Eagles would finally win something and everything in the Phillyverse would be right for 90 minutes. I could not have been more wrong as what unfolded before my eyes was a gem of a film that has something for everyone. Silver Linings Playbook is a rocky love story about mental illness that stays close to our hearts with funny and frank dialogue. The film brings home a point that we are all imperfect by showing the ups and downs of our imperfections in a real way. Using sports as a backdrop the story centers on a working class Philadelphia family that you'd swear live at the end of your street. If there were awards for Casting Director this film would get it. (Maybe there is an award for Casting Director??)The group of actors chosen for this film all complement each other so well it's as if they've know each other their whole lives. You would actually expect to see these folks together at a bar or a BBQ. It was great to see Chris Tucker in a role where he was not running through Hong Kong or yelling at Jackie Chan and oh Julia Stiles where have you been? She is one of the underrated talents of her era. Bradley Cooper is stellar in his portrayal of the lead character Pat. I cant believe this is the hangover guy. He has arrived and is taking names. Hope they spell it right on that gold statue he'll be getting ; } It was also great to see Robert Deniro in a role that he was able to sink his teeth into as he was in classic form. There are some gut-busting laughs in this film and moments that make you squirm and say ""did he just say/do that?"" There are many strong performances all around from just an awesome and talented cast. The director let this story unfold for you and delicately nudged the story along through several ups and down always keeping you on your toes and afraid to take your eyes off the screen for fear of missing a moment good or bad. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in her range easily holding her own as the feisty ""Tiffany"". I expect we'll be seeing quite a bit of this beautiful and talented young actress in the immediate future. This is not your classic ""When Harry met Sally"" but will no doubt leave you with that same feeling at the end having you saying to yourself ""I just witnessed something! This film is going to do well collecting a few golden statuettes

18 May 2014,Wonderful Film!,"Silver Linings Playbook is an incredible film that brings to the light the subject of bipolar disorders, one of the rare films to do so. This film is so sweet and sentimental in one way, but in another way we get to see the dark side of bipolar disorders which results in extreme mood swings. But this film features an incredible screenplay that touches up on all the emotions, fantastic acting that uses the screenplay with heart and soul, excellent directing by David O. Russell, and just a compelling story about a disorder that affects many people worldwide.

O'Russell directed a film about a guy named Patrick who has just been released from a mental hospital and he moved back in with his parents. He also has a goal of reuniting with his wife despite a big incident that occurred between them. While pursuing his goals, he meets Tiffany whom ultimately has a dark past and problems of her own.

This film is a haven for acting because the acting here is just incredible. The chemistry between everyone is just top-notch and it's clear that everyone was very involved with the film. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing and she clearly steals every scene she's in and she deserves her Best Actress win. She shows awesome chemistry with Bradley Cooper, who comes into his own this movie. Cooper shows lots of range by taking this role and this was a risk that paid off handsomely. Robert De Niro gives his best role in years and Jacki Weaver does a great job as well.

Overall, Silver Linings Playbook is just an excellent film that is not only funny, but is deeply touching. The first hour and fifteen minutes are the best, while the final half goes through the conventional romance stage, but it's very much worth watching thanks to the excellent acting. It's well-written, well-acted, and one of the best drama films of the year. I rate this film 9/10.",9
17 April 2013,Perfection,"PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE ALL BEN WAITING FOR; THE PERFECT FILM IS HERE GUYS!!!!! Nothing more can be said about this film that perfect, sorry. OK, I'll try to give a normal review now. Jennifer Lawrence puts herself on the A list status now in this flawless film by David O. Russel. This film is all about the ups and downs of life and trying to make it through them and find a Silver Linings. We follow Bradley Cooper, who also puts himself up on the finest actors out there, as a recovering bipolar patient who learns that everyone around him has just as many problems as him. It truly has the most heart I have ever seen in a film. It is the most powerful film I have seen in years, it even made me cry, and then cry laughing. Sorry I sound so unprofessional, I am just lost for words about this perfect film. Best movie of 2012, and it easily made it onto my Top 20 of all time list. Again, sorry for being unstructured in this review. GRADE: A+

20 May 2013,fun with little craziness,"I saw this movie in the afternoon, at the start it was like boring... but as the movie goes on... it seems to be fun...Bradley Cooper has done really nice job.... the craziness with simpleness, Jennifer Lawrence is just awesome,so cute....they both did great job... i'm not saying that its a great movie but if you watch it with no expectation.. in the boring afternoon. you really gonna enjoy.....

There is nothing serious story in this movie but we don't need seriousness all the time, it's a very simple movie.. some people may find that it's boring or lack of sense but it doesn't, you have to just see it in fun way.

it's a good movie for watching in free time, with some fun and little craziness :))

28 January 2013,"A ""feel-good movie"" that earns its feelings","The romantic comedy has never been the most respected genre in film, but and I think in earnest that's because so many of them just go through the motions and don't let their characters earn the sympathy that the filmmakers expect the audience to feel for them.

Silver Linings Playbook is a rarity, an ostensibly ""feel-good"" movie that doesn't pull punches and isn't afraid to go dark places but ends up trusting in its characters and its audience enough to see it through to the end. Bradley Cooper is solid, Jennifer Lawrence continues to reveal herself as one of the best actresses of her generation; and how refreshing is it to see Robert De Niro finally finding himself in a good movie again after years of slumming? This is his best performance in years and I hope he continues choosing better projects in the near future.

David O. Russell got a bad stigma in Hollywood for a few years after I Heart Huckabees and the infamous meltdown video, but with this and The Fighter he has thankfully proved he still has the talent that made him such an interesting filmmaker early on in his career.

In a year full of great movies, this is one of the better ones, and one I'd like to revisit again. It's everything a great romantic comedy should be and I'm glad audiences are starting to connect with it.",9

13 April 2013,Incoherent trash,"It doesn't matter who's in your film - if the story's terrible, they're not going to save it. And so here we have Silver Linings Playbook - a title that brings together the two seemingly innocuous themes from the movie that together invites the same response as they do in the movie themselves, that being ""erm, what?"".

The story is a mess of several ideas tenuously strung together that just doesn't seem to make sense and, upon reflection, really does seem like a poor excuse to bring so many big names together.

And these big names don't even save it, due to the awful dialogue. Granted, there is meant to be some chaos to it because of the unhinged nature of the characters. However, when you have so many of the actors talking over each other and spouting drivel that is obviously the result of some poor improvisation, it makes for a truly unpleasant and uncomfortable viewing. Now there will be some people who will justify this as ""it was intended this way"", but, intended or not, this is not an enjoyable film to watch.

A collection of poorly-realised ideas that can't be redeemed by a usually great cast. People have been star-struck by them - don't buy it, this is not a good movie.",3
23 January 2013,Was the screen writer drunk?,"What a cheesy mess. No plot really, we really know nothing about either character except through hearsay. Theryre mental issues were more of a distraction than a plot point. The fact that they were even on these hard anti-depressants seemed out of whack too. And what was the point of the Chris Tucker character??

Then they threw in the ridiculous ""good luck"" joo joo crap, and then made THAT a major plot point to give the ending a corny sports movie ending?? I didn't really care about Pat at all..he seemed annoying. They used music to add an ""edge"" to the the drama, but hey forgot to make the plot and characters interesting.

Best picture nominee? The other nominees should be insulted..

25 October 2020,Must watch!!,"SEVENTEEN STARS OUT OF TEN!!!

Pat is curiously confident and upbeat for a man just released from a mental hospital and under a restraining order from his wife. That's because he's determined to repair the damage he's done to his life and surprise everyone by moving ever onward and upward. His motto is, ""Excelsior!"" What stage of bipolar disorder would you guess he's in?

Pat (Bradley Cooper) assures his parents, Pat Sr. and Dolores (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), that all will be well. They're not so sure. One of the charms of ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" the screwy new comedy by David O. Russell, is how Dolores is a sane and caring woman and has had long experience in dealing with compulsive behavior, because her husband is a fanatic fan of the Philadelphia Eagles. Having been banned from the Eagles' stadium for fighting, Pat Sr. now focuses uneasily on his TV set, convinced that the Eagles will win only if his several superstitions are fulfilled.

Pat Jr. in desperation is drawn toward Tiffany (2010 Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow in the neighborhood. Lawrence appears here much transformed from the woman we saw in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""The Hunger Games."" Still only 22, she looks softer, sweeter and somehow prettier than before, yet she plays Tiffany as all edges and elbows, who can understand Pat because she's crazy herself.

We're fully aware of the plot conventions at work here, the wheels and gears churning within the machinery, but with these actors, this velocity and the oblique economy of the dialogue, we realize we don't often see it done this well. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is so good, it could almost be a terrific old classic.

22 January 2013,Silver Linings Playbook — An emotional piece that makes it right for all of us to be a little crazy,"Silver Linings Playbook makes it right to have problems, mental problems. This is a big taboo in our society. We all have those kind of problems to one degree or an other. Even if the main characters have heavier symptoms to deal with, this is a way to show that it is acceptable.

At first, you'll be uncomfortable with Pat's unusual behavior, but it will immediately feel much better once Tiffany enters the scene. Even though his behavior doesn't change, once there's someone else like him, you feel immediately better. Why? Because it normalizes him. When we meet somebody like us, we immediately feel better, more acceptable, less worried what others think of us. We feel the same about others.

In this film, all the scenes, dialogs, and emotions are real and solid. The acting is superb and the story surprising on many occasions. This is definitively the best performance Bradley Cooper has given, and Jennifer Lawrence is his match on every level, we just don't spend as much time with her as with him. Robert De Niro plays a great character, and Chris Tucker fits right in. Everything is perfect.

This script even plays the ""lie"" right, and the final moment got me yearning for a girl to cuddle and love. It has been a while since a movie made me feel that. I just can't find anything wrong with it. If you want to pick something negative, I'd say that the professional dancers are not good actors. That's it.

The only reason not to watch it might be because you don't like that kind of story. It's about average people, with average surrounding, salary, homes, and lives. There's nothing marvelous, scintillating, or stupendous, just normal.",9

Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
26 February 2013,I Have Bipolar Disorder. I'm thinking.. Is this a puzzle?,"I was hospitalized once before. I went to live with my parents after. I obsessed about my ex. Then I got medicated. So somehow, I had to see this. It could be the story of my life.

Okay.. the mood swings are accurate. But I was trying to look for the depth in this story and there wasn't any. I feel like they used Bipolar Disorder to create a ""cute"" story. It's not fair for people living with the disorder.

They make it look like everyone's gonna get cured if we just ""think positive"". This is just too superficial for someone who has really seen mental illness and been with people who have mental illness, this is NOT TRUE. I'm giving it a 6 for the good acting. It just didn't make sense.

17 July 2023,My Kind of Silver Lining,"There is so much to unpack in this movie. It is as multi-layered as the characters in their affliction, a fluctuation between hell and manic exhilaration. Watching two flawed people, one with a diagnosed mental disorder, and the other one with an undiagnosed mental illness, find each other amidst life, family, friends, and Western medical therapy inflicting their world views upon Tiffany's and Pat's daily life is visceral, funny, triggering, even satisfying at times.

The dance competition routine is fantastic and shows in a brilliantly artistic way the highs and lows of BPD.

If you or somebody you know suffers from a mood swing disorder, this is an absolute must-watch!

7 February 2013,Silver Linings Playbook deserves all the accolades it gets,"When my movie theatre-working friend suggested seeing a film yesterday, this was the only one currently out that neither of us had seen yet that I wanted to watch. And both of us were very glad for the choice! I mean, you wouldn't think a romantic comedy-drama about two emotionally or mentally depressed people possibly falling in love would hold much appeal but it did for me and my friend. And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence. Also so glad Ms. Lawrence got her Golden Globe and if she wins her Academy Award, I'll be even more happy! Really, despite all the messy emotions that are explored here or maybe because of all that, I really enjoyed and highly recommend Silver Linings Playbook!

29 December 2012,Excellent film,"This is a great little story with many layers and such good acting. The characters are people you don't necessarily like but somehow you really begin to care about them. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are just so good together. Supporting cast is quirky and flawed and equally excellent. The mental illness side of the story is told with an open and honest approach. It ultimately comes down to doing the right thing.The self absorbed life style of being mentally challenged (behavior disorders not personality) is pushed aside in order to put oneself in a place to be happy and loved. You need a ""strategy"" in life is so true and happiness is out there if you fight for it. That's the message I got from this fine film. Love the Philly angle! Saw it twice and my college age kids loved it too!

24 March 2013,boring and oh so predictable,"The story takes a long and circuitous path to get to the predictable ending. Wished I had watched it on DVD so that I could have fast forwarded to shorten by at least 50%. Why Jennifer Lawrence got her Oscar on the strength of this film/performance above other contenders is a total mystery. If this is a story about someone recovering from a mental condition then that seems to take second place to the predictable story line about boy meets girl/ they both have issues/they sort out the issues and live happy ever after (as does every one else in the movie) The secondary story line about father's (Robert de Niro) gambling only serves to add to the predictability of the ending. If this is supposed to be a 'feel good movie' it certainly did not work for me

16 September 2013,Uninteresting enough,"This story of a man diagnosed as bipolar and released from psychiatric internment at a state institution after a few months there which led him to lose his job as teacher and his wife is rather uninteresting though the movie is well made, directed and acted. He was mandatorily interned because he has severely beaten his wife's lover and he was also mandatorily restricted of approaching or contacting her. Then he's got the obsession of recovering job and wife and tries do do it by somewhat awkward means. In the course of this he meets a woman with some psychological troubles also with whom he starts a supposedly friendly relationship since she apparently tries to help him to fulfill his aims. This story is weak, slack and lacks depth. The ending is too predictable to constitute a surprise. A movie to be seen for want of better only.

26 December 2012,Best movie of 2012,"Been wondering all year when a truly good movie would show up, and this one is it. The subject matter of the mentally ill was not all that different or special, but what made this film special was the screenplay first and then the marvelous dead-on acting of the entire cast. Jennifer Lawrence will surely be the next big name in female actors, as she was so natural and real in her demanding role that you never saw the acting, just the character. Bradley Cooper played well the lead ""problem person"" in this film of many, his riveting blue eyes nailing to the wall any he looked at and spoke to. Robert DeNiro, in yet another role as an off-center parent, was his terrific self in much more than just a supporting role as he was integral to story development.

But, above it all was the truly great David Russell screenplay, as we have all seen stories with similar subject matter that were harmed or even ruined due to out of place and/or flat comedic elements and collective bad acting or a low quality script. This movie not only had the gravitas of truth and honesty in it that most don't have a clue about, but it also glowed from the very rare and intangible inner magic of a screen writing gem that resulted in an ensemble triumph most films would not even hope for, much less obtain.

In your lifetime, if you have ever felt marginalized or on the sidelines or not really ""in"" life due to personal issues, and that covers most of us at one time or another, do yourself a true favor and see this wonderful movie of initial anguish and despair that eventually becomes one of believable hope and triumph.",9
21 October 2012,Brilliant on every level !,"Saw this on 10/20/2012 at the Austin, Texas Film Festival. Cast member Julia Stiles was there seeing it for the first time. the movie had the SRO crowd of all movie people laughing, cheering and invested for the entire film.

the script was brilliantly written without resorting to a cliché ending. The movie manages to handle an ensemble cast , all portraying flawed characters, without stepping all over each others performances. There is also a beautiful combination of comedy, drama and pathos in one great film. If I had been watching this movie at home on DVD, as soon as it ended, I would have watched again. Congrats to all involved!

3 May 2013,The Dialogues and Lawrence's Eyes Win This One,"Pat (Bradley Cooper) is released from a psychiatric hospital and moves back into his parents' house. He has been diagnosed as bipolar and has a restraining order against him by his ex-wife, Nikki (Brae Bee) He wants to get his life back and constantly looks for silver linings to let him know he is on track. He meets a somewhat damaged Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) but is still obsessed with Nikki and wants her back.

So what we have here is troubled boy (Pat) meets troubled girl (Tiffany) and can these two negatives make a positive? What makes this work is the dialogue between the two because when one has nothing to lose one becomes brutally honest. And, that is what we have here and it was most refreshing even with numerous F-bombs flying everywhere.

Bradley Cooper must have bought a Flobee (google it) as his beard is always the same length throughout, but the beard was necessary to give his face some much needed definition. Good move. He does a good job and he needs to stay with drama and leave those unfunny and raunchy HANGOVER movies behind. They made Jennifer Lawrence look a little Goth, but once you look into those eyes you instantly fall in love. When she delivers her lines it's like she is talking directly to you. The chemistry between these two works only because of her eyes. When she is on screen, you don't see anyone else. (Hey, we fell in love with her when we saw Winter's Bone. Nothing has changed.)

A very good supporting cast is bolstered by Jackie Weaver (Pat's mother) and Robert DiNero (Pat Sr) who does probably his best work in years. Pat Sr is an avid Eagles fan but has lost his job and now makes book and this plays into the movie's outcome.

Danny (Chris Tucker) who was also in that psychiatric hospital with Pat keeps getting released, or so he says, but the cops always find and return him. He was okay even though he was given subdued lines. What happened to the Chris Tucker we liked from those Rush Hour movies? Subdued lines and Chris Tucker don't mesh. Hey, we had Pat rant and rave when he was off his meds and everyone was afraid of him, why not Chris Tucker when he's the best at that and he does it with humor? They could have found a way. Bummer.

There is a twist in here (it's a good one) and you could see it coming from miles away and this is where the love story really takes hold. The highlight of the movie is the dance contest that Tiffany talks Pat into practicing for and actually performing in. As we (and they) go along we just cannot understand why Pat cannot see that silver lining - he keeps looking for - that is before him all the time.

All in all this is excellent, but the dialogues all around and Lawrence's eyes make it so.

Silver Lining Playbook was nominated for Best Picture. Bradley Cooper was nominated for Best Actor. Jackie Weaver was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Robert DeNiro was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. David O. Russel was nominated for Best Director and Adapted Screenplay. Jennifer Lawrence was the only one to come away with an Oscar: Best Actress. Well deserved. (9/10)

Violence: Yes, some at the football game; and Pat goes berserk a lot in the beginning. Sex: No. Nudity: Briefly a female backside only Language: Yes, mostly in the first half.",9
10 April 2019,Two lost souls and a lot of football,"Pat (Bradley Cooper) is just out of a psychiatric institution, after eight months of ""treatment"" for violent behaviour and assault on his ex-wife's lover. He lost his job and his home and he is forced to move in with his parents.

Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow, stricken by grief after her husband's death, who turned to compulsively sleeping around. The fact that Lawrence plays a part written for a woman over thirty undermines her credibility, but not her capability to deliver.

They meet not-so-cute at a dinner organised by Tiffany's sister and from then on the plot creeps along, following their tentative relationship. It does not help that Pat's father, played by De Niro, is a bookmaker obsessed with football.

Way too much screen time is dedicated to this sub-plot and if you do not care about football - like me - you might find the second part quite tedious, with all the betting and games. Maybe without that and with a tighter editing, it could have been a decent movie... still not Oscar-worthy, but Cooper and Lawrence have some chemistry and their characters are marginally endearing.

On a general note, even if Pat is generically described as ""bipolar"" and Tiffany as ""borderline"" they seemed just two people who found it difficult coping with traumatic events - which does not imply any serious mental illness. I found it weird that in our society, reacting in violent or unpredictable ways to the blows of life, is apparently considered as ""mental illness""...",4

21 February 2013,not ha ha funny,"i give it a 5 out of 10. (unless i explain this it's not a spoiler).

very well executed. steeped in nonsense. some might call this movie 'romantic'. i'd feel sorry for them. it's not that i can't appreciate the artistry in the telling of the story. it's just that i don't see much that's based on anything in the neighborhood i've experienced as reality. growing up in brooklyn, many of the characters in the movie seemed familiar. but that doesn't make them any less pathetic. what's sad for me about having spent the time to see this film is that i wish there was something a bit more substantial that i could take away as a souvenir. instead, i'm left with a reaction from the majority of responders that does not reflect well on their internal workings.

1 May 2013,SuperBad,"In spite of all the good reviews and high IMDb score, I did not have very high expectations of this movie. However, I did expect a good quality romcom. Well, it turned out to be a mind-blowing bad movie. In fact, I can't think of one good thing to say about it. The writing, the acting, the directing, etc. - it was all bad. There was no chemistry between the main characters. Not funny, not touching, very pretentious and stupid. The story was unoriginal, predictable and boring. The only mystery about this movie is its Oscar nominations and an Oscar Win! I guess, Oscars can now be bought in Hollywood if you have the well-paid campaign behind it. A true disappointment.

1 February 2013,"Beguiling, poignant and affecting.","Of all the movies released this month, SLP was in the lower half of my 'must-see' list. The trailer was decent and the cast were all attracting awards buzz, but I just didn't think it was my kettle of fish. When I'm wrong, I'm really wrong; this charming little picture from David O. Russell (The Fighter, Three Kings) absolutely swept me off my feet. Russell, who also penned the script, strikes a perfect blend of drama and comedy throughout, using the humour to open up the characters which subsequently adds more poignancy to the serious moments. It's an affecting tale regardless, but it's hard to imagine it being quite as hypnotic on screen without Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as the lead couple. I was beguiled every step of the way by Cooper's bipolar-affected Pat and Lawrence's off-kilter widower Tiffany, as they spark up an unlikely friendship that endures the whole gamut of emotion. Both nommed for Oscars – as well as Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver for their parts as Pat's parents – Cooper will understandably struggle to beat his counterparts but don't be surprised if Lawrence walks away with a Golden Baldie, she deserves it.",9
13 January 2013,What's the fuss about it?,"Okay! So SLP has emotions, amazing performances, wonderful story and screenplay and some fresh writing... but I give it a 7 and it cannot beat my favorite rom-com this year, Moonrise Kingdom!. Here's why:

You take up the long-lost and beloved genre of rom-com and take up all the Oscar winners' tit bits and you make a movie. You add some emotions, shaky camera-work (which they term realistic), great actors and you get SLP. It's a simple drama and I couldn't find comedy in it. Yeah, it made my partner cry... so what? I induces emotions, yes I appreciate that. But to be very frank, I didn't really enjoy much watching SLP till it reached the climax. And another thing was, I could somehow predict what was to happen. Well, it might have appealed to the stereotypical or electrolytic people but I have to announce - this doesn't work anymore. You may have bagged a lots of accolades, but god, it doesn't intrigue!

Now, the Bradley is amazing, Jennifer Lawrence is child labour. First Hungry Games, then that House at the end of street drama and now this! And I hear she received some other critics award. Oh, god spare me the horror and please give it to Chastain!

Anupam Kher acts dumb, so does De Niro sometimes. To conclude, I would recommend it but I have to admit - it is a one time watch! :(

WATCH OUT FOR: Chris Tucker!

16 August 2013,Meet a new girl dance with her and forget your unfaithful wife,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",6

21 January 2013,Buffalo 66 re-set in Philadelphia with many more words,"Romantic? Definitely. Bizarre? Most definitely. Predictable ending? Sure. Comedy? Not the rollicking type, but in the classic sense of a non-tragedy with some amusing touches and incidents, it qualifies. Great acting? I'll take issue with consensus here - I thought Jennifer Lawrence was electric. I thought Bradley Cooper showed a bit too much physical self-control during his intense bi-polar episodes but was otherwise very good. DeNiro seemed to overlay his performance on Gazzara's in Buffalo 66.

Why do I compare this film to Buffalo 66? You have an off-center protagonist coming home post-confinement with unfinished business and a chip on his shoulder. You have a dancer with some emotional damage of her own as the lead female (albeit not held hostage) against a blue- collar backdrop of economic depression and local sports hysteria.

This film is less misanthropic than Buffalo 66 and has some brighter characters, making it a lot less dark overall - but many of the themes are similar - as is the unlikely romantic resolution.

One major difference - Buffalo 66 nailed Buffalo - felt like buffalo during the week I spent there. I spent 10 years in Philadelphia. First, I'm unclear whether this was supposed to take place in Italian South Philadelphia or Llanarch (a suburb just outside west Philly), but the roads where he ran seemed much too wide for either and the houses and front yards were much too wide as well. Parking was too spacious. They talk about the 76 (which everyone calls the Schuylkill - or various local take-offs - school-kill, sure-kill, etc.). It passes by South Philly, but nowhere near Llanarch (they show a Llanarch Diner). DeNiro and his betting ""friend"" seem right in character for South Philly. None of the other family members look or act the type particularly. Julia Stiles' character (sharp performance in a thankless role), family, and home with lawn seem more like Llanarch but the areas shown in most of the running sequences don't match. Then the Indian bus and the parking lot brawl seemed way too staged and forced. Unlikely that just getting off the bus - a bus they've seen before and had a friend of one of their group on it - would precipitate such a brawl. So, for those who trumpet how realistic this movie was, I found the depiction of Philly and its dysfunctional sports fanatics to be totally off. Invincible did a much better job of depicting these folk as they are. The story in Invincible was more credible also. I lived there during the Vince Papale years.

All that said, I generally wouldn't get so deep into a romantic comedy but this one is considered very special and ground-breaking in its characterizations. It is a good movie and does an acceptable job to me of characterizing one person with one manifestation of bi-polar disorder, his friends, and his sports-crazy dad for me to enjoy. I'd have been interested in learning a bit more about Lawrence's character's post-traumatic nymphomania and its treatment since this too can be a real dysfunction but that was glossed over and I only accepted it because of the fire in the belly Lawrence displayed. Her subtle traits and occasional physical ticks lent credibility to me.

So, overall, I enjoyed this somewhat Hollywood-ized and somewhat clichéd but still highly thoughtful and enjoyable movie. Certainly, I've found many less engaging ways to spend two hours in a movie theater in the past 10 years.",7
17 January 2013,i'm more cynical than most but i thought it was GREAT!,"Yeah, so what if it has a ***** ******. Sometimes good things happen too. A little slow to start perhaps or maybe i'm as brainwashed as most waiting for the explosions,violence and vehicular carnage of most modern movies to come but it doesn't for the most part, there is real passion and life in this tale and the subject matter (mental illness-relationships) is portrayed in a really engaging way, i didn't expect a lot when i started watching and i'm definitely not a fan of ""romantic comedy's"" but personally i'm glad i saw this great little film. All actors did a fine job and i ended up caring for the characters. The best movie i've seen for a good while and ""recommended"" under sells it. Apologies for the spelling, no apologies for the rating.

31 December 2012,"Unconventional, But Could Have Been Ripped From Today's News","For one reason or another I don't see many movies these days, so I had never seen or heard of the two primary actors in this movie, Bradley Cooper and the beautiful Jennifer Laurence. Watching them on screen in this movie, though, has truly been eye opening. They are both brilliant, if not totally realistic, in this film in their depiction of mentally ill people trying to return to ""normalcy."" The only actor I recognized immediately was Robert DeNiro, and his performance was, I think, his best in may years. The supporting actors in the cast were also uniformly good, especially Chris Tucker. Severe mental illness and other neuroses are not a laughing matter, but this film uses fantastic humor to bring those problems to our attention. And that mentally ill people - rather beautiful people in this film - need love as much, if not more, that the rest of us is something to think about. Despite the subject matter, this is still a romantic comedy. It's poignant as well as terrifically funny. Go see it.

19 April 2015,Nice set-up - lame conclusion,"After his release from a mental institution, a bi-polar ex-teacher called Pat wants to reconcile with his unfaithful wife. She's taken out a restraining order to prevent him from making contact, so he enlists the help of a female acquaintance. The troubled Tiffany has problems of her own - she's a young widow using sexual promiscuity to deal with the grief of losing her husband - but she agrees to act as Pat's go-between if he partners her in a dance competition.

Since 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romantic comedy, Pat and Tiffany's unusual arrangement soon develops an emotional element. Jennifer Lawrence breathes her quirky brand of combative femininity into Tiffany, but it's not enough to save the film, since everybody else is playing the fool. Whenever she's on-screen, the story has vitality, but instead of exploring the off-beat relationship between a couple of misfits, the narrative detours into a slapstick sub-plot about a small-time gambling operation run by Pat's father. Most of the film's potential degenerates into farce and sentimentality long before it concludes with a predictable ending at the dance contest. Although it's been a huge box-office success, this play-book only has a cardboard lining.",5
12 November 2021,A must see film,"This film shows if you have a well-built character and a good story that gives you a new perspective of something it can truly be a film that you will remember for a very long time. Such a beautiful film and must-see. 10/10.

Hats off to David O. Russell and the cast, especially Bradley Cooper for bringing such depth & humanity to the character.

This is my favourite film and it deals with this particular human condition in a heartwarming way.

27 November 2012,An interesting and a fun experience at the cinema,"SLP is one of the few movies that's worth watching on the big screen, not just because you know there won't be any loud and obnoxious people in the cinema with you, but for a seemingly good time that seems to fly so quickly that you feel slightly dazed when the end credits roll.

The story is interesting, if a little bit clichéd in one part, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It was fun trying to watch Pat try to sort out his life after being let out of the mental institution and once out he has a host of obstacles to overcome, the least of which happens to be Tiffany, a young unemployed widower.

Bradley Cooper is excellent as the disturbed Pat, so scarily so that you think that Cooper in real life exhibits these problems. He's well supported by Robert DeNiro as his Dad, with one or two loose screws of his own. Jennifer Lawrence is good but for some reason, for me anyway, she didn't quite pull off the role of a crazed or mental person. At least not when you compare her to Cooper.

The pace of the movie moves along quite nicely, the editors doing a good job of moving from scene to scene seamlessly. There's never a drop or a part that doesn't fit in. The humour is funny and helps break the serious flow at the right moments.

All in all it's a good movie, an even better date movie, but one that you'll enjoy at the cinema.",7

23 August 2013,Why this many nominations? Absolutely mediocre!,"I'll never understand why this movie got nominated for this many awards. It's just as good as any mediocre romance/comedy like Adam Sandler movies and such. All acts were normal (not amazing and certainly not Oscar worthy). Jacki Weaver who was nominated for best supporting actress was (IMHO) awful and did a terrible job; at some points in the theatre I was looking at her and thinking ""did I really pay 15 bucks to watch this act?"". Anyway, I believe this movie is highly overrated. Seeing that this cheesy movie stood beside amazing movies like Life of Pie, or Lincoln or Argo is an absolute disappointment.

But the plot was thin and predictable, and all the shouting was tiresome. It was verging on comedy but never quite making it. I've seen far more amusing digs at US family life.

I read a lot of strong reviews but I just don't agree with them.

I've been on antidepressant meds for the past 8 years and always felt uncomfortable in my own skin, like I just don't fit in and for me it felt very good to see a movie where the characters are flawed, and I felt with them and could identify with them a bit.

Maybe this movie is only for flawed dysfunctional people, but that's okay with me, because it's by being crazy beautiful things happen... :)

3 May 2023,Jennifer Lawrence outshines more than Bradley Cooper,"(2012) Silver Linings Playbook DRAMA

Mom, Dolores (Jacki Weaver) has just signed a release form to allow his adult son, Pat junior (Bradley Cooper) out of an institution for attacking his wife's lover. And upon getting out, Pat still believes that him and his wife still get along as a couple, even though she has a restraining order against him. But, in order for Pat not to be sent back to the institution, he has to live under his parents supervision, who are his parents played by Jacki Weaver as the mom and Pat senior played by Robert DeNiro. Oh, yeah, Pat junior also suffers from bi-polar, who has tendencies to overreact with violent outbursts, and sometimes he'd have to do things in a specific way. And of course, he's eventually going to meet by chance the Jennifer Lawrence character, as Tiffany who has issues as well. Also starring is Chris Tucker as Tucker, the person he made friends with while he was in the institution, and Julia Stiles. Difficult movie to do, about a person who is bi-polar, but the interesting suggestion that's been done here, can be labelled as therapeutic, such as ballroom dancing was a nice touch. And I also liked the fact that the environment didn't have any guns around, since if Pat were to get a hold of one, as he has unknowingly attacked people for no reason, then it would've turned into an entirely different movie altogether.",7

What better 'silver lining'in a movie can you ask for, and isn't this the best thing a movie could hope to achieve? I couldn't fault any part of it. The only thing it was missing was the full sense of depression and despair that bi polar sufferers experience, put to be honest that would make too uncomfortable viewing for me. fantastic acting from everyone, especially the lead roles. should have received more Oscars.

24 September 2015,Jennifer's Silver Lining.,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

11 December 2014,A unique and powerful love story,"I don't normally watch romantic films as you know what's going to happen. Here, if you've watched the trailer or read a plot summary you haven't already seen the entire movie. It's just a drama about 2 troubled individuals and their resulting friendship, but it feels different, unique and moving. Silver Linings Playbook combines a lot of different elements: Mental illness, American Football, romance and comedy. It's a difficult mixture to get right and there are times when you're unsure whether you're meant to laugh or be moved. However, those moments are only sporadic and the elements blend together remarkably well. It's elevated by the acting: Bradley Cooper, after the disaster of The Hangover Part II, is extraordinary as Pat, although he's overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence's awe inspiring Oscar winning performance. Even more satisfying is Robert De Niro giving maybe his only truly noteworthy performance since Heat. Every actor in the film does a good job overall.

With developed characters and strong dialogue the screenplay is finely written and goes to various extremes of its elements but manages to wrap up in a moving and believable conclusion. David O Russell makes a typical formula look far better visually than it would normally, and a best director Oscar may be on the cards in future for him. Inevitably it's quite a tough film at times and isn't the most original film out there but it's better than the overrated American Hustle. SLP is a very entertaining movie throughout its runtime and the acting and humanity of the script draws you in very quickly. It looks like it may be a fairly boring movie, but it's far more interesting than expected. Jennifer Lawrence is the star of the show, but Robert De Niro's return to form is great to watch. Sadly, he went and did Killing Season, Last Vegas and Grudge Match, but we'll always have Taxi Driver. Well deserving of its best picture nomination, this is a superior drama movie and it's not your average love story. That's a good thing though. Take this over The Proposal.

28 December 2012,"Oscar contention aside, this is a funny, sassy and empathetic look at mental illness","Following 2010′s stodgy boxing drama The Fighter, the notoriously difficult filmmaker David O. Russell returns to the big screen with buzz movie Silver Linings Playbook. A warts and all look at mental illness, it's a film of unassuming beauty, pottering along with great ease during the two hour running length, but underneath the breeze is a resonating story of strength, courage and a love the likes of which we rarely see on the big screen.

Annoyingly, if you take a quick glimpse at the synopsis, Silver Linings Playbook wreaks of Academy Award worthiness. Adapted from Matthew Quick's debut novel, it's the story of Philadelphia, bi-polar thirty something Pat (Bradley Cooper), a high school substitute teacher who's mother (Jacki Weaver) has just bailed him out of a mental institution – against doctor's orders – after an eight month residency. What caused him to snap? He came home one day to find panties on the floor, his Stevie Wonder wedding song on the stereo, and his wife Nikki having sex with another man in the shower. Traumatized, he beat the guy within an inch of his life, and since then has lost everything – the job, the wife, the life and his sanity.

Pat returns to the real world and moves in with his doting mother (Jacki Weaver) and gambling addicted Eagles devotee father (Robert De Niro). Down but not out, he's convinced he can get his life in gear and win back his wife, even though she has sold their house, moved away and has a restraining order on his head.

Along the way, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow turned sex addict, fired from her job after sleeping with everyone in the office. Like Pat, she's a little bit crazy, and they turn their unlikely power dynamic into a therapeutic friendship. Spending every day together, the two compare medications, partake in public fits of rage, and find themselves trading favors – and dance moves – to get what they want.

Whilst the young Lawrence has already put in some astonishing performances so far with Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games, Cooper is the real surprise treat here, finally matching his affability with a character of some depth.

Together thought, they have a natural magnetic charge which drives the film and elevates it from being another harangued look at mental illness. De Niro puts in his best performance in recent memory as the negligent OCD father trying to win back his son's love. Even Chris 'Rush Hour' Tucker is great in a brilliantly muted performance as Pat's delusional friend. When that guy shuts up, he really has some screen presence.

But all of these performances would be nothing without O. Russell's eloquent screenplay. Whilst his jolting hand-held cinematography suggests child's play, his words are that of a seasoned professional. Whilst it is no doubt a marketing catastrophe, the script makes the film unclassifiable, vigorously shifting between comedy, drama and tragedy, whilst never waning the audience's interest, or turning to the quirk/irksome like O. Russell's god-awful I Heart Huckabees.

It's nowhere near the best film of the year acclaim I've seen it garnered with – the pacing can be off, and it doesn't really get moving until Lawrence turns up on screen – but Silver Linings Playbook is nevertheless a great movie. With just enough crowd-pleasing sweetness, sexiness and O. Russell idiosyncrasies, it's an empathetic and moving look at people in dire straits, on the search for a silver lining. Tiffany and Pat find it in each other, and you'll find it in this film.

4 May 2013,'The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday. That's guaranteed.',"Something there is about a movie that while in the theaters everybody loves and then the Oscars come 'round and awards pour in, you you're left with the thought 'how can two actors known for such films as potty mouth Hangover I – III and credibility challenging violence such as Hunger Games make a film worth all the hullabaloo?' Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.

The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the ""silver linings"" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.

The entire cast is superb – including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake – and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special. Highly Recommended.

14 November 2012,Bradley Cooper delivers the year's most surprising leading performance...,"The amount of heart and wit embodied in David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is one of the tender and surprising films of the year. Russell, who has brought his quirky comedies to the screen like I Heart Huckabees (2004) seemingly never found his footing in the genre. Russell has had his fans championing his choices such as Spanking the Monkey (1994), Flirting with Disaster (1996), and especially Three Kings (1999). In Playbook, you can chalk it up to the source material by Matthew Quick, or the way Russell approaches telling the story but it's one of the director's bravest attempts to date. Despite a love story that feels forced and a bit tedious and predictable, the film is a breath of fresh air to the romantic comedy genre.

Comically whimsical when it needs to be, the film searches and fines an emotional epicenter lying in the brilliance of Bradley Cooper and the rest of the stellar cast. Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper), a former teacher that attempts to reconnect after his ex-wife after spending several months in a mental institution. Living with his parents, Pat attempts to get in shape, focus, and reconcile relationships since his return until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young mysterious girl with problems of her own.

As Pat, Cooper shows a dynamic range of comedy and emotion that audiences never knew he had. It's a marvelous turn by the actor who has shown glimpses of greatness in The Hangover (2009) and earlier this year in The Words. While most of the film, Pat operates at a level ten, Cooper never overcooks and oversimplifies Pat's candor and honesty. It's one of the year's most surprising and delectable turns.

Jennifer Lawrence's approach to the character is different than others. Tiffany lacks much of the likability factor that Pat or his family and friends do. Tiffany's antics, foul-mouthed liners, and over indulgence into Pat's life can be off-putting to some. It's still unclear whether the failure is on Lawrence's interpretation of the character or the structured laid out by writer/director Russell but the performance is merely satisfactory and doesn't stand out in a cast where everyone is producing career highs. I simply don't get the overwhelming love for the performance.

As Pat Sr., the undiagnosed father who may have some ticks of his own Robert DeNiro, who has shown blips of excellence since his Oscar nomination for Cape Fear (1991), is back in full force; dramatic, sensitive, zealous about the work, and magnetic. It's inducing what DeNiro puts out for the audience to view moment after moment. As the overly loving and beautiful mother Dolores, Jacki Weaver practically spends the entire film on the edge of tears. Dolores, who is the exact opposite of Weaver's character Janine in Animal Kingdom (2010), embodies worry and nurturing effortlessly.

In another surprising turn, Chris Tucker, mostly known for eyes and laughs in the Rush Hour films, completely floors me as Danny, the mentally-ill friend with his constant yearning to escape. Tucker shows a maturity we haven't seen before, even when he's hilarious. Julia Stiles as Tiffany's sister Veronica, Anupam Kher as Dr. Cliff, Pat's therapist and especially John Ortiz as Ronnie, Veronica's husband round out what is sure to be this year's winner of Cast Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

The film also seems to have a more serious and political approach into the medicinal purposes in mental health rehabilitation. Is it about getting to the root of the issue and attempting to rid it or about drugging you so you don't have to face it? A daring question to ask as the comedy casts a shadow over this dramatic look into one man's approach.

Silver Linings Playbook is a sure-fire hit with a loving sentiment and heartwarming laughs. In the end, if there's one hero of this team, Bradley Cooper is M.V.P. hands down and delivers one of the year's most exciting leading man turns. A must-see in 2012.

13 April 2013,Characters you can root for and believe in,"Mental illness is no fun, making a film about such a topic is fraught with risk. Sanitise the condition and be accused of soft soaping or show it like it really is and wave goodbye to a mainstream audience.

Director David O. Russell has managed to find a delicate balance and tone, that for the most part works exceptionally well. A film about a serious mental condition but deceptively, not really about that at all Pat (Bradley Cooper) is suffering from a previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. We meet him as he is released from hospital following a traumatic event, neatly essayed in flashback, to live with his parents as part of his release conditions.

His eternally optimistic mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) is hopeful that everything will turn out well but is realistic about Pat's chances. Pat senior (De Niro), is less convinced but is pleased that is son is home and relies on him to bring luck to his beloved Philly Eagles. Games he must now watch from home, for reasons explained later.

Following a couple of false starts, Pat with optimistic catchphrases in place, is keen to win back his wife, restraining order not withstanding. He gradually starts to find a rhythm and balance to his life and is greatly aided by a relationship he strikes up with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany has more than a few issues of her own to deal with and the pair eventually team up for an unlikely dance tournament. Subconsciously deciding that two ""crazies"" working together might be just enough to get through the day.

As Pat learns to cope with life outside, we follow their character arc through their relationship with Pat's family, friends and counsellor (Kher).

If this sounds all a bit heavy, you would be wrong. The first segment is perhaps a tough watch in parts but if you stay with the story, a gentle rom-com emerges which errs just this side of believable.

Sure, there are parts where some Hollywood movie magic has been sprinkled but without this lightening of the story, many might be put off, which would be a shame.

Cooper proves he can act without a Hangover and Lawrence again shows her range as she remorselessly powers into the Hollywood A-list. Here posting a spirited turn, just rewarded with a best actress Oscar award. De Niro and Weaver provide solid support with De Niro finally finding a role that at least partially uses his talents.

If nothing else, the story points to a universal truth, that the patients in the hospital are not the only ""crazy"" people around. Many of those close to Pat have problems of their own, they just cope a little better. Any film that attempts to make this subtle point is to be applauded and the screenplay, although uneven in parts, does a good job of making this both palatable and entertaining to a multiplex audience.

There is plenty to enjoy, whether your level of cynicism or life experience allows you to fall wholeheartedly for the story is up to you, there is a guilty pleasure to be enjoyed here for those that can.

Summary

A well crafted and acted story, which manages to morph into a feel-good movie, without selling out or betraying the worthy underlying message.

Entertaining, thoughtful and for the majority of the running time, a story and characters you can root for and believe in.

15 January 2013,Casey's Movie Mania: SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012),"Two years after his critically-acclaimed boxing drama in THE FIGHTER (which also won Christian Bale his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar), writer-director David O. Russell has finally returned to his roots (quirky comedy, that is) in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. The result is one of his funniest movies to date. That's not all -- SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the ultimate feel-good movie of 2012, anchored by memorable cast and witty screenplay all around.

Adapted from Matthew Quick's 2008 novel, the story centers around Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher who is an emotionally troubled man returns to his Philadelphia home of parents Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after spending eight months in a Baltimore mental institution. Apparently he is ordered to stay there because he had nearly beating a man to death following an affair with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee). He is certainly a short-tempered person, where he suffers a severe case of bipolar disorder -- a condition related to manic depressive illness. And yet he refuses to stay on his medication and believes he can control himself. Now he vows to do everything he can to win back his wife -- starting by getting in shape and such. The problem is, his wife already filed a restraining order against him, which made him even more difficult to achieve his goal.

During that time, Pat has unexpectedly making friend with an emotionally troubled widow named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a self-proclaimed ""crazy slut with a dead husband"". Then Tiffany offers to pass along a letter to Pat's wife, since she sees her regularly, on the condition that Pat will help her as a partner to compete in a local dance competition.

Judging by the premise, there's actually nothing original about the story. But yet, it was the way of its execution that made the movie so compulsively watchable. Thanks to Russell's entertaining script, the plot is constantly funny and involving while the quirky dialogue are razor-sharp. Russell's direction is also top-notch especially the way he play the situation about the subject of mental illness and of course, two psychologically unstable protagonists (Pat and Tiffany) for genuine laughs without resulting into cheap mockery or mindless slapstick.

Apart from Russell's awesome piece of work, the cast are remarkably ace as well. In his best performance to date, Bradley Cooper has never been this charismatic before. What's more, his neurotic acting is often fun to watch for. As Tiffany, Jennifer Lawrence gives another tour de force performance in her career. No doubt she projects a magnetic screen presence here. She can be tough, vulnerable, sassy and sexy (love her dark hair) and most of all, an amazingly funny actress rolled all into one. She's a completely perfect acting package. Other supporting roles are equally captivating as well: Robert De Niro has never been this spontaneous in a long while as Pat's father who is particularly superstitious with football; Jacki Weaver is delightful as Pat's caring mother while Chris Tucker appears in a memorable cameo as Pat's best mental-ward buddy. It's nice to see him playing a well-balanced comic relief without exaggerating his larger-than-life persona we used to find him in movies like RUSH HOUR trilogy. Even smaller roles like Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist, Julia Stiles and John Ortiz as Pat's neighborhood friends, Veronica and Ronnie, have their own share of limelights as well.

Technical credits are well-calculated here with great use of its Philadelphia setting in the suburban area that you almost feel like home. Masanobu Takayanagi's zooming hand-held camera-work and Jay Cassidy's hyperactive editing combined well together to mirror the twitchy effect of Pat's whirlwind mindset. Completing the tech package are Danny Elfman's music and a perfectly-chosen soundtrack supervised by Sue Jacobs (especially that Stevie Wonder's evergreen love ballad My Cherie Amour).

SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK could have been a five-star comedy masterpiece, if not for its minor flaw. Too bad the middle part sags a little as if Russell is struggling to maintain the perfect momentum. But once the climactic finale kicks off with a local dance competition involving Pat and Tiffany (a memorable one, indeed), the movie is certainly exhilarating enough with a highly-satisfying payoff.

So if you are looking for a current movie that puts a big smile on your face and characters that you can root for, look no further than SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.",9
30 December 2012,Really enjoyed the movie !,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",9
2 December 2012,Good but flawed,"'Silver Linings Playbook' is a film directed by David O. Russell about a man with bi-polar disorder who is trying to get his life back on track after suffering a mental breakdown upon discovering his wife was having an affair.

The story is a bit bizarre with Pat (Bradley Cooper) befriending Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who also suffered a mental breakdown after the death of her husband. Pat agrees to enter a dance competition with Tiffany in order to send a letter to his wife via Tiffany to try and re- build their relationship. The first half of the film seems a bit misleading. It portrays bi-polar disorder was just being the same as someone being a little bit odd or quirky. I don't think that they take the disorder seriously enough – for a film that a lot of people have claimed will win big at the Oscars in 2013, I don't think it will; it has missed the point with mental illness. The plot itself moves quite smoothly and I was never bored whilst watching this. The second half is better; it becomes a lot funnier and seems a lot more light-hearted. The plot is good but the acting can sometimes let it down.

Bradley Cooper is quite bad; he has obviously done very little research for his role and has clearly read a paragraph on bi-polar disorder noticing that, under stress, they can shout and panic – there's a scene in the film where he is screaming and his eyes are blank with no emotion. This meant that the scene came across as funny and people in the audience were actually laughing during a scene that was written to be a scene of heartbreak. Jennifer Lawrence was excellent here; she portrayed her character perfectly and provided humour where it was meant to be. She has obviously done a lot of research for her role and she has had a fantastic career in 2012 which can only get better. Chris Tucker was a surprisingly positive addition to this cast; he died not annoy me at all in this film which was a huge development. David O. Russell has done a great job with the characters in this film. Robert De Niro is another great supporting character here; his role as Pat's father who has some form of OCD is just brilliant and he really seems to have portrayed it just right. This is his best performance in quite a while and I hope his films get even better.

Overall, I liked this film; there were just a lot of flaws within it. It has some good comedy, some great performances and is a fairly good film to watch. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, you will like this film as it is yet another film that would have failed if it wasn't for her (see House at the End of the Street). This film is worth a watch but I don't see it doing well at the Oscars – I hope not anyway.",7
13 February 2013,I was so underwhelmed. Be wary of the hype!,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5

1 January 2022,A decent DeNiro movie,"This was interesting. I haven't seen a decent DeNiro movie since the 90s. Bradley Cooper delivers, as always, and Jennifer Lawrence compliments this toxic duo nicely.

I've certainly enjoyed this but Not sure I'd watch it again though.

13/8/22 - I did watch it again and I enjoyed it even more.

22 November 2012,A movie that knows just when to break the rules,"The problem I have with romantic comedies is that they are the most formulaic and hidebound of all the genres. If it's a comedy, then by definition it has to have a happy ending. And if it's a romance, the only happy ending is to have the two leads get together. So usually I'm just tapping my toe, waiting for the leads to get through the requisite squirming before the inevitable.

Lately, we've seen a variety of crude gags thrown into the mix, presumably to distract us from this inevitability This movie does a great job of hewing closely enough to the standard romcom formula to keep an audience satisfied, while undercutting it enough to surprise us now and then and prevent us from seeing exactly where it's going at any point. The outcome of the big dance contest is a perfect example.

It's not easy to write a movie that's this particular, this original and yet satisfying. Wonderful performances don't hurt, either.

Warning: There are a few unbelievably long scenes. And yet they work.",9

29 July 2013,Favorite Film Of 2012,"This is writer/director David O. Russell's follow up his 2010 film The Fighter

It is Written and Directed by: David O. Russell it's based on the book by: Matthew Quick. It Stars: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker

Plot: Pat Solitano (Cooper) after spending time in a mental institution is now out and living with his parents and is looking to get his life back on track and get back together with his wife. Pat meets Tiffany (Lawrence) a girl with her own problems, who offers to help Pat reconcile with his wife but first he has to do something important for her.

This film is amazingly Written and Directed, it's stunningly acted, its perfectly paced and has a brilliant soundtrack

I love the way the film plays out and everything in this movie works extremely well

In this film you really have to sit back and enjoy the ride. It's technically a romantic comedy but unlike some others I was not bored for a second from beginning to end

After this film ends I felt happy and its a great quality in a film if it makes you happy when you watch it

Silver Linings Playbook is definitely my absolute favorite movie of 2012. Thank You David O. Russell for giving us such an Amazing Film.",10
18 June 2013,"You say ""Tray-zo-done,"" I say ""Tra-zo-done""...","As nearly as I can figure, Harvey Miramax likes his movies to start out all edgy and unconventional, as long as they turn into feel-good fantasies by the end, and David O. Russell likes raucous ensemble comedies with everybody yelling and shvitzing and running his program. Russell must've loved the idea of a compulsive father and a bipolar son under the same roof, and De Niro's OCD bookie dad more than earns his keep, but son Pat, the film's protagonist, is kind of a misconceived character, and Bradley Cooper struggles to make him seem like more than just a screenwriter's sock puppet.

Bipolar or not, Pat's a mixed-up, messed-up guy who's had to whittle things down to a few basic concepts, which works okay as a survival strategy, but tends to make everything he does and says seem selfish and simple-minded--for reasons too ludicrous to go into, e.g., he has a late-night meltdown when he finds out that Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" doesn't have a happy ending. Aussie actress Jackie Cooper is great as Pat's underprotective mother, and Jennifer Lawrence is a powerful presence in the manic pixie (or, if you prefer, the depressive freakazoid) dreamgirl role, though her big scene, which takes place in De Niro's crowded living room, gets ruined by excessive mugging and stagy ad libbing by the supporting cast.

I'm emphasizing the negatives here because this multiple Oscar-nominated movie is really a pretty decent mainstream romantic comedy; it loses some momentum before the big finale, in typical romcom fashion, and really only deals with the subject of mental illness in a very skittish and sitcommy way. I would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't been led to expect something more insightful and original.",6

6 July 2022,An excellent film.,"I confess that this movie was better than I was expecting. I thought I would find a simple romantic comedy, conventional and relatively predictable, but I was very pleased with the way the story develops and the conception of the characters. The director, David O. Russell, is also responsible for ""The Fighter"", a film that won two Oscars but that I don't think is as good as this one.

The script is, in my opinion, quite well written, and follows Pat, a man who has just been released from a psychiatric hospital where he served a sentence of a few months, after catching his wife in the act of adultery and violently assaulting her lover. With his marriage over, he goes to his parents' house, his father being a crazy fan of the town's football team and seems to be convinced that having his son close during games brings good luck to the team. In the midst of his attempts to get close to his ex-wife (who has imposed an injunction on him by law), he approaches Tiffany, a young widow, with a strong temper and very explosive manners, who proposes to help him in swaps him being her date in a dance contest.

The story is very good, and it is full of shenanigans arising from the volatility of Pat and Tiffany's personalities. The characters, played convincingly and very committed by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, are complex and demanding, and it was great to see the way in which the two actors were facing the challenge and solving what they had in front of them. Furthermore, Lawrence won the Oscar for the work done in this film, which, in addition, had seven other nominations - Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. In addition to the duo of main actors, the film has an excellent supporting cast, including the impeccable Robert DeNiro, the wonderfully restrained and maternal Jacki Weaver, and the dysfunctional and strange couple played by Julia Styles and John Ortiz.

In the midst of so many good things, is there anything less good or possibly bad? I think so. Although I really like the film in general, I feel that the ending was a little cliché, and that the solution found is a little too conventional for a film that seems to want to give us something different from most romantic comedies we are used to. I also thought that there are some characters that end up not getting enough attention (Julia Styles, John Ortiz, in a subplot that gets very sketchy and underdeveloped). But these are points that end up not detracting from the film's value, criticisms and minor repairs.

On a technical level, I would like to positively highlight the excellence of the cinematography, with the film taking advantage of the good filming locations in the city of Philadelphia, and the editing, which makes the film pleasant, giving it the right pace. Good sets and costumes (in particular what is reserved for Lawrence, who has a somewhat depressing look) complete the positive values of a discrete production, without great effects or visual artifices.",9
29 November 2012,All Eagles fans are nuts!,"I really enjoyed this romantic comedydespite the fact that I'm a Cowboys fan (and that's saying a lot).

Maintaining an overall tone that is both dark and witty, while at the same time quite touching and genuine, ""Silver Linings Playbook"", aside from being my early pick for best ensemble cast of the year, proves (once again) that even though writer/director David O. Russell is responsible for ""I Heart Huckabees"", there is still hope for him as a filmmaker (and no, I didn't like ""The Fighter""). Using the backdrop of an eccentric Philadelphia community obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles, this movie tells the story of a man who is recently checked out of a mental institution (played by Bradley Cooper) by his mother. In an attempt at a fresh start and with hopes of getting back together with his ex- wife, he must illicit the help of a widow, who might be crazier than him (brilliantly played by Jennifer Lawrence). ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a breath of fresh air within a genre that is normally riddled with predictable Harlequin romances, starring a neutered Zac Efron or crying Channing Tatum. In short, in case you didn't know that these kind of films existed, this is a romantic comedy that in turn, is also a very good movie.

As far as comedic entertainment value goes, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" isn't always laugh out loud funny, but makes up for it by having an extremely well crafted storyline, with its entertainment roots strongly grounded (for the most part) in reality. And this aspect is only accentuated about 30 minutes in by the chemistry that Lawrence and Cooper bring to the screen, as they interact in some of the most genuinely intriguing back and forth's seen in any film this year; in any genre.

While I'm on the subject, allow me take some time out to elaborate on some of the standout performances in this film. First off, Cooper gives a performance that finally proves that he can act (calm down everybody, ""Limitless"" wasn't all that) playing a character with mental illness in very Jack Nicholson-esque fashion (not an award worthy performance, but still pretty damn interesting to watch). I must also make it a point to say that Chris Tucker, who only plays a bit role as the seemingly pointless token black friend character, plays it with such enthusiasm, injecting much needed doses of comedy sporadically throughout the movie, that by the end, he may have many audiences asking themselves ""where has Chris Tucker been for the past decade?"" And maybe the most surprising aspect of this movie is how, after an assortment of awful career choices (to the point where nobody under 18 thinks of him as one of the greatest actors of all time) Robert De Niro, playing the father with OCD, finally gives a performance that doesn't feel like he's phoning it in. As for the most stand-out performance, the award goes to Jennifer Lawrence (see what I did there?) giving the BEST PERFORMANCE OF HER CAREER! You heard me. That's right ""Winter's Bone""/Sundance snobs! As the equally eccentric (and ex-slut) foil to Cooper's character, Lawrence plays the role with unabashed vigor and something to prove, in a performance which will hopefully garner enough attention from the Academy to obtain another Best Actress nomination; but this time, for a good movie.

The only hiccups in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" occur in its final act, when a lot of the genuineness is lost, as the story becomes a sort of contrivance; BUT an entertaining contrivance. What all of that means is, the generic romantic comedy pot hole which this movie falls into in the final 20 minutes (having to do with drastic life choices being solved with a competition) will probably be dismissed because of everything good that proceeded it.

Final Thought: From the lively acting, to the gritty low-budget feel that O. Russell brings to the screen, to a script ripe with undeniable believability (also adapted for the screen by O. Russell) ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is no doubt the best romantic comedy of the year. And, as I alluded to before, is a film which in every way supersedes the chick-flick, Katherine Heigl norm, translating into a date night movie which can be enjoyed by either sex; and even by the Bradley Cooper fans who think ""The Hangover"" was ""the greatest movie ever, Bro!""

20 February 2013,Pure C***.,"That was a real struggle to watch it till the end..Can I say what this movie is In one word ? Crazy.. Totally crazy. Not even a bit funny. The ""madness"" shown in this movie ain't that extraordinary. As a matter of fact We all know some people with emotional problems, or who don't seem to be ""alright"". But there is, usually, a reason for that. That's what this movie lacks. A good point to base the behavior of the characters. Everything seems ""exaggerated"" in this movie, even the problem of the characters and their feelings. On the other hand no one is ""normal"" around the main character. Everyone seems to have some ""disorder"" to a minor or major extent. But it's slow paced, most of the movie are people having arguments, there is this ""fixation"" of the main character upon someone, a lot of ""blá-blá-blá"", and so on.. I know American families are usually as crazy as this one, so I can understand the bonds American audience will have with it, but it is so far from my reality, so ""crazy"" I couldn't relate. As for me ? Nah, it didn't work.

Russell and it's a brilliant story based on Matthews Quick's novel. All the actors are excellent, but I loved Jennifer Lawrence, not for nothing with this film she won her firs Oscar. I thought it was an very interesting and romantic film.

14 January 2013,"In a nutshell - Well-executed direction, strong screenplay and more importantly powerful performances","Silver Linings Playbook was one of the best movies I've seen in recent times. The story was completely out of box with versatile performances by Bradley Cooper , Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Anupam Kher.

Released from a mental institution , Pat tries to reconcile back to his ex-wife after losing his job , his house. Moving in with his parents , he meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own but who becomes the only silver lining in his life.

From the director of critically acclaim The Fighter, David O' Russel gives in yet another powerful drama with some knockout performances. The story and script is powerful with some high octane drama that is sure to keep you engrossed. However , this movie is challenging and is made for niche audiences that is sure to keep some folks at bay. Couple of scenes have been executed brilliantly - the scene where Pat tries to find his wedding video at 4 AM in the morning, the scene at the Diner restaurant between Pat and Tiffany and her sudden burst into flame is one of the best scene in the film. The film relies more on actor performing at the moment and that is the best part. Direction contains lot of gravity and is handled superbly. Screenplay is grasping. Editing is crispy. Art direction and Cinematography is good. Dialogues are punching. Story , based on Matther Qucik's novel , is well-written. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the soul of the film. It is their enduring performances which makes this film more watchable. Watch out for their chemistry as if they are playing real characters. They vehemently supported by fine performances by Robert De Niro and Anupam Kher.

Silver Lining Playbooks is definitely a strong contender for upcoming awards this season for its well-executed direction, strong screenplay and more importantly powerful performances. Excellent 4/5",8

It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",1
12 January 2013,"Cooper Outacts DeNiro in Grating, Sometimes Endearing Film","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot.

Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife.

The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in ""Farewell to Arms"" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs.

The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a ""we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.""

Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless.

I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was – eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being.",7
20 November 2013,"An Instant Classic that will be Remembered for its Outstanding Performances,","Silver Linings Playbook is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an impressive cast that all really suit their characters. Bradley Cooper,Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro all delivered outstanding performances and Lawrence definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Although, personally, I preferred Cooper's performance, he really put all his heart in to this character and delivered some very intense dialogue with pure passion, it was also a very unique role and I don't think he had a lot to work with in regards to rehearsing. It's definitely a romantic comedy but the cast and the different characters are very refreshing. At times very dramatic and other times quite funny, there is no other movie like Silver Linings Playbook and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or romance film.

A man moves back in with his parents after spending time in a mental institution, and decides to become a new man to impress his ex-wife, but everything changes when he meets Tiffany, who shares many of the similar crazy traits he has.

Best Performance: Bradley Cooper",9
16 January 2013,Bradley Cooper is officially an actor.,"Bradley Cooper is officially one of my favorite actors after watching this film. No, seriously. I've liked his movies, like the Hangover and the A-team and The Words. But this movie- this movie brought out the best of his talent. The story centers around Pat, who was just released from a mental institution after a major breakdown when he found his wife cheating on him. He moves back in with his parents on the thought that he was destined to get back together with his wife, who - evidently has a restraining order against him. It's a challenge for him, dealing with his newly diagnosed bipolar disorder and his OCD father who will bet everything on the Eagles winning a football game.

But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of one of Pat's friend's wife. Tiffany is probably just as screwed up as he is. She's a broken, lost girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her but knows a lot about living. The two form an unlikely friendship, and though they each have problems of their own, you know instantly that they'll be perfect for each other.

There was something about this movie that stayed with me after I finished watching it. I'm still not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it was the strong performances of Lawrence and Cooper that made me realize how good of a movie it was. Perhaps it was the storyline and the characters that were so ridiculously troubled that you couldn't help but cheer for them the entire way through. Lawrence's performance was spectacular, and I have a feeling she will become quite an actress in the years to come. But it was Cooper's performance that took me by surprise. As he's known mostly for his comedic roles, Cooper's dramatic role was superb. He stole each scene, and you could tell he loved playing this character.

The pacing of this film was excellent, not a dull moment in the entire movie. The supporting characters were wonderful, especially Robert DeNiro, who played Pat's OCD father. The script was fantastic, perfectly written and the dialogue was genius.

This is one of those rare gems, where people have heard about but don't really know what it's about. After watching this movie, Cooper and Lawrence definitely have to take home the Oscar. If not both, than definitely Cooper.

I will probably own this movie when it comes out on DVD, I loved it that much.",9
9 September 2020,An odd portrayal,"This film is an odd entry in the romantic comedy genre in that it heavily focuses on a semi-stable man with bipolar disorder as he struggles to rebuild his life and repair his relationships. The portrayal of mental illness rides a fine balance between character comedy and dramatic tragedy. His personality is best described as oblivious - he stumbles around fully convinced that what he does is perfectly clear and normal, and doesn't want to hear otherwise. Along the way he meets a companion with (I think) a borderline personality which comes with its own hangups. Throughout the film, their interaction is as wild as the disorders they possess, yet has a stable core in the theme of healing.

14 November 2012,Love and football,"Silver Linings Playbook is kind of a Jerry Maguire for 2012. There's a lot of talk about love and a lot of talk about sports - well, football mostly. And it involves two emotionally wounded characters at the forefront. But these two have way more issues going on than Jerry Maguire ever did. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man who just spent 8 months in a mental institution. He's technically married but problems with his marriage are part of what led him to the institution, and he doesn't know if his wife has any intent of even seeing him again. His best friend tries to hook him up with his wife's sister, Tiffany, even though Pat's main focus is to work things out in his marriage. Tiffany certainly has a dark side, which Pat fails to realize is actually fitting for him. His own wife is scared of him after all. But he's the kind of guy who obsesses on whatever he focuses on. So when he realizes that Tiffany can speak to his wife for him, he starts to pay her more attention. It's apparent that Pat gets both his temper and his obsessive ways from his father. His dad (Robert De Niro) is a hardcore sports fan who seems to care about nothing more than his hometown football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, winning. In his superstitious mind, any little thing can affect the outcome of a game. And that can include his son's well-being and even who he's dating. So Pat generally feels a lot of pressure on him, and much of the film is about his attempts to cope with his surroundings as well as making an effort to better himself as a person. Jennifer Lawrence shines as Tiffany, showing an acting range well beyond her years. It's not only her and Bradley Cooper's finest acting to date, it's also the best acting Robert De Niro has done in at least 10 years. The film even manages to bring a funny Chris Tucker out of seclusion who hasn't been in a movie not named Rush Hour in 15 years. The fact that the film was actually shot in Philadelphia is very beneficial. (Bradley Cooper is also a native.) The movie truly captures the Philly mentality and attitude better than I've ever seen on film before. And as someone who lives in Philadelphia, I know just how crazy the Eagles fans in particular can be; there's no embellishing that here. The movie's got a little something for everyone. Die-hard sports fans can appreciate it as much as those who like a good ""chick-flick"". But for everyone who watches, they'll see that no matter how bad things get, they can always find another path to get back on track. Silver Linings Playbook opens on November 21.",9
12 September 2021,"High 7/10, low 8/10. Rocky start, very strong ending","Kinda all over the place at the starting, picks up pace near the end and ends on a very solid note and ending.

Not the funniest film, a solid romance flick, not much else to say about it.

2 May 2013,"Well acted with good dialog, storyline degrades to standard Hollywood fare","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy.

14 January 2022,So good I have ordered the book,"In 40 years time when they are making the TV programme 'Discovering Jennifer Lawrence', this will be one of her key performances. Great acting from ALL involved. This is one of those 'wordy' films that keeps you hooked right from the start and despite being about a very serious subject, it has some hilarious moments. Two days later and I am still thinking about it which is rare for me these days.

22 February 2013,Clichés at every turn in this oddball town,"Silver Linings Playbook"" was a must watch movie on my wish list after it picked up 8 Oscar nominations (not to mention that it stars one of my all time favorite, Robert De Niro) this year. Not only it has cornered all the big nominations this year, SLP is the only movie since ""Reds"" in 1981 to pick up all the 4 acting nods (Best Actor/Actress, Best Supporting Actor/Actress). With so much going for it, its natural for the viewer to expect something out of the ordinary. Alas, the only thing not ""ordinary"" about the movie is that it revolves around a bunch of ""abnormal"" people.

By way of story, SLP is about Bradley Cooper's character, who suffers from Bipolar Disorder, and his tryst with all the other neurotic, obsessive compulsive, dysfunctional, superstitious people and other plain weirdos that he encounters with alarming regularity in the tiny little town he resides in. Based on ex high school teacher Matthew Quick's eponymous novel, SLP neither turns out to be a screw ball, irreverent comedy (something like ""Crazy People""), nor is it a feel good, heart warming tale (like ""Forrest Gump"") or not even an accurate depiction of the real life situations of bipolar people (remember Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn in ""Lust for Life""). So what is SLP all about? I don't really know and neither does the Director David O Russell. He tries hard to make SLP a rom-com, a comedy, a quirky fun film, a family drama, a feel good film about the proverbial under dog, but eventually ends up with a mish-mash tasting more like yesterday's stale left overs.

The only silver lining of this largely forgettable effort is an assured, confident and bravura performance from its lead actor, Bradley Cooper. Cooper is the tour de force here reminding us that he is meant for bigger and better things than inane movies like ""The Hangover"". His performance is truly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Other members of the cast, including De Niro, Chris Tucker and Jennifer Lawrence, are at best adequate and at worst over the top, hamming impresarios.

My recommendation to evolved movie viewers is to skip this playbook and go watch a re-run of ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" if oddball characters are your preferred choice of viewing this weekend.",5
25 April 2018,Doesn't Bear Scrutiny,"Life/people are complicated and this movie portrays that brilliantly. But it is at times static and then bamboozles its audience with sports betting jargon and then loses me with superstition and finally a pat ending that hides any worries we might have about the characters' future. And didn't we all guess that Pat knew what he reveals at the end? Performances are great. Pity the movie doesn't bear scrutiny.

14 February 2013,We can all gain a little something from this one,"Every comedy has to have an element of drama, but not every drama has to have comedy. So combining the two, while leaning in the slightest bit towards the drama side of things is not easy to do. In 2011 it was 'The Help' and in 2012 it was 'Silver Linings Playbook' that did it best. On both occasions, a delicate balance was found and it makes for a rewarding watch. Here we have a fascinating love story, mixed with a family dealing with possible mental illness. Great, positive characters thrown into this situation allow us to feel what they are going through emotionally while still having a laugh throughout. And it is genuinely, laugh out loud funny at times.

The story follows Pat who, after an 8 month stint in a mental institution, comes home to live with his parents. He is intent on reconciling with his wife, but things become complicated when he meets an interesting young girl by the name of Tiffany. Silver Linings Playbook has the rare distinction of having an actor nominated in all four acting categories at the Academy Awards. Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence and Jacki Weaver are the well deserved recipients of those nominations. Cooper was exceptional in the lead role. The evolution of his character, combined with his perfect balance of comedic timing and dramatic effect, make his nomination well deserved, although I feel he'll be hard pressed to take the award home. De Niro is equally excellent. It's great to see him in a role like this, where his true acting potential can shine through. Too often these days it feels like he's appearing in comedies. Lawrence is the best of the lot. She is simply captivating in her role as Tiffany. Her screen presence is immense, even overpowering De Niro in a particular scene they share. Put her in Goodfellas and she would've fit right in. Personally, I feel Emmanuelle Riva deserves to win Best Actress for 'Amour', but Lawrence has a great chance of snatching it herself and it would be well deserved if she does, nonetheless. Finally Weaver, not given a great amount of screen time, she thrives in the little she has. She has the ability to put the audience in hysterics with a simple awkward glance. Not a chance of winning but a nicely deserved nomination for sure.

Silver Lining's Playbook reminded me a little of another film, and that film was 'Yes Man'. Both films have a similar underlying message and that is be positive and positive things will happen to you. It's a great message and one that we could all learn a lot from. I remember after watching 'Yes Man' going out and giving the concept of saying 'yes' to everything asked of me a go (not quite to the extent in the film, but enough), and I found myself doing some really amazing things with my time. Things I wouldn't usually find myself doing and it felt great. Over time I suppose that concept has slipped from my mind but Silver Linings Playbook brought it all back again because it's a positive, heartwarming story not to be missed. Watch the movie, feel the emotions the characters feel, listen to what they say, act how they act, be impulsive now and then and that $10 you pay to see Silver Linings Playbook might just be the best money you ever spend.",8
24 March 2013,Dysfunctional isn't really funny,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012) was scripted and directed by David O. Russell. It stars Bradley Cooper as Pat, who has been in a mental institution since he ""lost it"" when he came home to find his wife in the shower with another man. Robert De Niro is Pat Sr., who makes his living as a gambler and bookie. Enter the beautiful and mysterious Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. At dinner party, Tiffany and Pat trade tales of their psychotropic medications, and then they enter into a love/hate relationship. Finally, the two become dance partners and enter a dance contest. You can take it from there.

I didn't enjoy the movie much, but I give Russell credit for showing us that mental illness really is an illness, and it's not funny. Jennifer Lawrence deserved an Oscar for her role in Winter's Bone, but I wasn't that impressed by her acting here. Robert De Niro's role struck me as tiresome. Of course he's one of our greatest actors, but I think he was just going through the motions in this film.

We saw this movie in a theater, but it will work well on DVD. It's worth seeing, but not if something better is playing.",7
27 April 2019,A love story performed by two neurotic patients.,"1. Everyone is extremely lost and frustrated when the exam is down, the layoffs are laid off, and there is a major illness. Maybe it's a particularly serious one in the movie where Pat witnessed his wife cheating. But are these rare in life? It shouldn't be. Although it was a bit of an exaggeration to get Pat into the hospital with this incident.

2. The dialogue between the characters at first glance looked chaotic, as if everyone were crazy. But if you look closely, there is only one starting point for these dialogues, and that is love. The mother loved her newly discharged son, father loved mother, Pat loved his brother, Pat loved his wife, and Tiffany loved Pat. Pat, of course, is in deep love with Tiffany. A web of love, holding everyone in the movie.

3. Tiffany looked more serious than pat on the condition, although she had not been to the hospital and was not considered a psychopath. And emotionally, she looks a little too active. This is confusing, and it seems nonsense and illogical. But the real situation is that Tiffany is so short of love that her experience has led her to be the most vulnerable in the show.

4. As long as you understand the 3rd, the film's final hero and heroine kiss together only seems so valuable. Can see two neurotic patients love each other, let people feel that the world is too beautiful.",8
12 February 2022,Beautiful,"Beautiful film based on a strange new pair of two with mental problems who deal with their lives in a strange and spontaneous way. The whole film is very deep and of a wonderful positivity that gives a vision of life full of spontaneity and hope in others and in true love.

6 May 2013,Lawrence and Cooper are fantastic.,"While I don't think Silver Linings Playbook was quite worthy of all the praise it got from the ""experts"" and the academy, it was still a very good movie. Bradley Cooper is absolutely fantastic. This is by far the best role he's ever had and he shows that he really is a very good actor. Jennifer Lawrence is also incredible. Not only is she stunning but the range of her acting abilities seems to have no bounds. A lot of that range is shown in this film and, while I can't confirm that she did in fact perform better than the competition, I can say that her role was flawless and I can't argue her winning an Oscar for it. The supporting cast was also great with Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker, among others, providing added depth to the movie. The only flaw I had was that it dragged quite a bit towards the middle/end portion. It started great and ended great and most of the middle was very entertaining but from about the 60% to 80% part of the film it did feel a bit sluggish. Nonetheless, the dialogue and character development keeps you intrigued so I think most people would appreciate the movie.

28 February 2013,See this movie!!!,"Not many movies can move me in the way silver linings did. If you have any thought about if you should watch this movie or not let me clear that up for you right now..... WATCH THIS MOVIE! This can be a date movie, a movie you watch alone, or even one you watch with your family (though there is swearing so maybe not with kids), this isn't some sappy chick flick either guys will like this movie.... even if it's only for how stunning Jennifer Lawrence looks in it. Jennifer totally deserved winning the award for best actress for her role in this movie, she was amazing and pulled her character off perfectly. This is a movie people have to watch otherwise you are missing out on a great movie experience.

9 May 2013,"In spite of some minor flaws, the silver playbook shines","When I saw the name as the director of the film, I was almost sure that this film would be an offbeat romantic comedy and I was right! However, it doesn't mean that the movie is perfect or that great. You know, David O. Russell is a story teller, not a minimalist, not a formalist, it has advantages and disadvantages both. The main advantage is that he tells his story well, but the main disadvantage is that his movies are lack of any art form. I mean watching his movies is like reading a book or listening a story, not cinematic experiences. In the end, I wasn't impressed by the film cinematically or artistically, but liked the story and loved the characters. Depending on his style, his director identity, the story of the movie seriously exhausted me which I can see as a flaw, but the story and the characters saved the film for me. I didn't expect metaphors or deep character studies from the movie, but the movie could have been deeper anyway. This is a sincere film first, it doesn't play to the crowd, but as I know, it has been criticized as it is a formulaic film. Well Yes and No at the same time. The problems, but all of those were minor, of the movie for me are for example the movie was not devastating or intense enough. Yes, this is a romantic comedy, but I would have preferred a The Fighter-like film. At least darker than this film. In other words, this might have been a really depressing film, but it is not. This movie reflects some habits of the director too, for example there is a ""merry"" family similar with the family in The Fighter etc. As for De Niro, with all my regard, I believe that the actors who were the golden actors or legends of their ages don't play that great when they are old (most of them) Chris Tucker who gave a mind bending performance in The Fifth Element seems out of place in this movie, but the actor adds energy into the movie. Bradley Cooper is pretty good, but sorry not great. As for Lawrance, my first Jennifer Lawrance movie was X-Men First Class and I couldn't warm to her honestly and I thought that she was a bad Mystique in comparison with amazing Rebecca Romijn, but in this movie, I almost fell in love with her and even her crazy character. I loved her character too I confess. She shines, she steals the show from everybody! By the way, a beautiful little detail I caught in the movie was the movie hadn't evil ex wife cliché, it was different (see it and decide for yourself) The dance competition stuff may be makes the movie cliché and conventional, but also sweet and realistic. By the way, it reminded me Little Miss Sunshine. However, the motivations of the characters, their inner worlds aren't handled well, insufficient and a little shallow. We understand them, but we can't enter their inner worlds. The movie has not any problem about emotional involvement, but, not deep enough. I can't feel that these two people are desperate losers or stand for any kind of character in real life. And we witness their life with independent sections, so we cannot internalize the film totally, but all these doesn't affect the whole film much. By the way, it would have been much better, if the film had ended a few minutes earlier. Silver Linings Playbook is still a very good movie for what it is.",8
24 November 2013,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",4
30 December 2012,A romantic comedy with the heart of a poet and the brain of a movie genius,"I love David Russel. He is quirky. He is smart. He has style. He knows how to make a movie live, and how to make a story pulse. He knows how touch different cords of the heart. Most importantly, he knows how to make fun with weird characters without making fun of them, and this skill is the key to the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook.

The movie deals with two broken characters, Pat and Tiffany, who suffer from mental illness (bipolar disorder and depression) and are recovering from traumatic events that changed their lives. They meet by chance, and they form a bizarre friendship when they agree of doing each other a favor, which results in them being tied in long-term project until Christmas. The story is told from the point of view of Pat, recently released from a mental hospital and also dealing with his troublesome return to his parents' house.

Silver Linings Playbook is an odd romantic comedy between two broken souls. Its strength comes from the genuine mixed of two opposite strategies. On the one side, it follows the template of a romantic comedy, with its predictable twists and its reassuring plot resolutions. On the other hand, it subversively refuses to follow the beaten pat, not taking comedic shortcuts and not employing shallow characters. The director follows his characters with genuine interests and love for their human faults. It refuses to divide them in good or bad. It respects their emotions and their contradictions, which are beautifully brought to life by the actors. The pain of mental illness truly comes through, and although it makes for some funny moments, is never made fun at, but instead made part of the laughter with an accepting spirit.

The entire movie follows the main characters closely with steady cams, letting a vast range of emotions come through. David Russell maintains this style even in the climatic dance scene---and his decision to film the scene this way, prioritizing the character's point of view instead of the choreography, show that he is a real auteur. His style is modest, personal, original, and functional to the story.

So, following the template of a romantic comedy,David Russell creates a wonderful movie about the lack of happiness in life, accepting one's own problems, dealing with the turns of fortune, and grabbing the rare opportunities that life offers.",9

11 February 2021,Thoroughly enjoyable,"This movie just did everything right. The characters were all interesting, the two leads were absolutely electric together in every scene. Screenplay never let up, nothing cliche here, and the movie had a good pace. Laugh out loud funny in some parts, even with a very serious subject matter. And a very accurate portrayal of the manic side of bipolar disease.

I want more movies like this; sure, there is an overall formula here, but it breaks a lot of rules along the way, never becomes sappy or predictable. And the characters all develop, have great lines, and the acting is all first rate. A pleasure to experience.

10 February 2018,'Silver Linings Playbook' is the fantastic movie,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it.

17 January 2013,"A raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.","If you watch a game with a die-hard Philadelphia sports fan, you may think they're bipolar. One minute they're on cloud nine. One bad play later -- they're in the depths of despair. Most Philadelphians who are crazy about sports aren't really crazy. But Silver Linings Playbook is about one Philly sports fan who does in fact happen to have a serious personality disorder.

This isn't a movie about sports, though. Sports are merely the motif for a raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.

The movie set in 2008. We know this because of several real-life sporting events referenced throughout the movie event that myself -- and many other Philly sports fans -- remember well. (I loved that there's an entire scene built around a discussion of DeSean Jackson's infamous goal line blooper.) Bradley Cooper, himself a native of the Philadelphia suburbs, plays Pat Solitano, a substitute teacher who returns to live with his parents after spending eight months in a mental hospital. He's desperate to reconcile with his wife, who has gotten a restraining order against him. Things get complicated when he meets a beautiful-but-troubled young widow named Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Both have seen their lives unravel -- one because of a mental illness, one because of a tragedy. The movie is about getting closure, about letting go, and about finding that silver lining.

Cooper gets to show more range and paint with a broader pallet than his usual leading man roles have allowed, and he takes full advantage of the opportunity. Robert DeNiro plays Pat's father and he gives the kind of terrific, moving performance you expect that from an actor of his legendary status. Lawrence is also quite good. The true revelation, however, is comedian Chris Tucker who has a small role as one of Pat's fellow patients. He gives a subtle performance that seems far removed from the brash persona he became known for in the Rush Hour movies.

The rest of the cast and crew do their jobs well. Danny Elfman's jazzy score is one of his best, and a great soundtrack that features everyone from Led Zeppelin to Stevie Wonder supplements it.

Director David O. Russell (who adapted Matthew Quick's novel) specializes in movies about troubled young men and their families. In the Solitano family, life is centered on sports. Russell understands what many who don't appreciate sports often fail to grasp. Loving sports is not just about the love of the game – it's about being part of a community, it's the way fathers and sons bond with each other and how total strangers find common ground. When Pat speaks of his fondness for Sundays spent watching football, he talks as much about the game day food his mother's cooks as he does about the game itself.

Pat's personal motto is ""Excelsior,"" which is Latin for ""ever upward."" He's an optimist who believes he can improve himself and better days are ahead. In other words -- as every Philadelphia sports fan knows -- there's always next year.",9
20 July 2020,This movie will help you find silver linings in your own life.,"It's hard to take something sad and make it seem joyful. It's hard to take something challenging and turn it into something easy. It's hard to take a bad ending and turn it into a happy one. Sometimes, in life, those things aren't just difficult but impossible. Life, ultimately, is short and difficult and not naturally conducive to happiness. We have to make our own happiness, and that's where silver linings come in, or rather, that's why we should always be looking for and working to create silver linings. The theme of this film is silver linings and how even bad things can turn out good if we work hard and look for the best in everything and everyone.

Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, Pat (Bradley Cooper), who comes out of a mental institution after being sent there for a crime he committed, in part due to his bipolar disorder. He comes out ready to get his old life back again, including his wife, who left him and filed a restraining order after his conviction. He's convinced that all he has to do is get fit and prove that he's dependable and stable and his wife will want him back. He's convinced that all he has to do is keep working hard and trying to find the silver linings and his story will have a happy ending. As part of his plan to prove that he's dependable, he teams up with a woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who needs a partner for a dance competition.

As the film progresses, Pat puts more effort into his training with Tiffany, and his bipolar disorder becomes more and more manageable. American Sniper is another film that looks at mental illness and its effects and reveals a similar story of healing. It's about a Navy SEAL, and part of the story shows how he suffered from PTSD upon arriving back home after multiple combat tours (). Just like in Silver Linings Playbook, it shows how the main character built himself back up by looking outward and doing what he could for other people.

One scene that shows clearly how Pat's search for silver linings was paying off was when his brother came home to visit him. His brother apologized for not visiting Pat at the hospital and made some derogatory comments about how Pat was suddenly the looser of the family while his own life was going very well. In that moment, Pat could've gotten angry at his brother, but instead he forgave his brother and hugged him. And for the rest of the movie, Pat's brother didn't act like a jerk. That's the power Pat had in searching for silver linings. When he was looking for them and working to create them wherever he could, they became more likely and more powerful.

Part of the challenge of making a film like this is helping the viewer understand at least a little bit of what it feels like to suffer from a mental illness like bipolar disorder. The film did this well by using sound and editing. The quick cuts, particularly during conversations (the more heated the conversation, the quicker the cuts), gave a sense of conflict and increasing agitation of the kind Pat must have been feeling. Similarly, the sound design added to this atmosphere. The different sound sources (TV, people) came in and out of focus as the focus shifted from one thing to another, giving the viewer a disoriented look at what was unfolding.

Silver Linings Playbook is a film that takes a difficult, often sad topic and finds the silver lining in it. It shows that there's always hope, that any level of control that someone can exercise over their life is an opportunity that shouldn't be lost. And maybe, just maybe, that opportunity, if taken, will even turn into a happy ending.",9
9 May 2019,An OK movie... didn't understand all the hype,"It was just an OK movie to me. The characters and the script did enough to keep my attention but it was boring in some parts and I expected more. It didn't get exciting until the end, which became pretty much a typical Hollywood ending.

Two great things about this film, though: (1) The awesome chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and (2) The authenticity of someone battling bipolar disorder. (Much better than how it was portrayed in Tyler Perry's dreadful ""Acrimony"".) The character's mental illness was very similar to what I've witnessed with an ex-boyfriend and other acquaintances who have BPD.

9 June 2023,This is a film that assumes the line of clichés precisely to avoid these distorted endorsements in the message. A story about finding love and yourself again!,"So, how to measure and quantify the madness that each one imprints on individualities? Losing control, being euphoric at a certain moment, only to cry profusely from depression afterwards. It cannot be explained. Each case is different. Initially, we meet Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper, from ""The Hangover"", ""Without Limits"") in a psychiatric hospital because of the aggressive crisis when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him. His mother (Jacki Weaver, ""Animal Kingdom"") is going to pick him up. Thus, the spectator is immersed in the protagonist's neuroses, agitations, hyperactivity, who discusses Hemingway, at three in the morning, with his father, who runs with a bag of garbage and who meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, from ""Winter of the Soul"", ""The Hunger Games""), who lost her husband and who also cannot deal with the suffering. Gradually, they help each other, all without the cliché characteristic of a romantic comedy genre. The script for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" does not judge ""madness"", it just portrays it, trying to mitigate the hypocrisy and lack of understanding that one has about everything.

The element of bipolarity is this source of conflict, but consequently, it is also the source of unity between Pet (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jeniffer Lawrence), characters that are sometimes misunderstood by those who do not have similar psychological problems, or who do not see and hide themselves. That is why Russel feels very comfortable using these established clinical deficiencies in favor of comedy, elaborating with them, clearly staged situations, with the ""Q"" of absurdity provoked by the shock of the explosive conditions of both. In a really dramatic proposal, these sequences would quickly remove their legitimacy as a realistic study of characters, but for the romantic comedy, they are great bridges that build an empathetic charisma to them. A charisma not to empathize with their condition, but simply to bring them together as a couple.

Different from other projects, Russel's camera hardly elaborates a sequence with the most stylized mise en scene, that is, there is plenty of space left for him to take advantage of his talent, where in fact he is good, in this case, directing actors. Both Cooper and Lawrence have a very believable sense of unpredictability within the fixed idea of humor - the best, which comes from breaking expectations - for the romance involving the couple, but not only them, such as Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker and the rest of the secondary cast, has a very efficient comic timing with the intentional instability of the text. An instability that speaks to the premise of bipolarity and the original principle that the couple understands each other by talking and understanding their common problems, unlike the others pointed out by the script who always seem to deny their deficiencies in favor of individualistic pride. In this regard, we can cite the most obvious example, which is the character of De Niro and his addiction to superstitions for sports betting that cornered his son for the same problems he suffers, but it is preferable to go to the character of John Ortiz and the scene that reveals how he relieves the stress of garage marriage problems. Realize that these small and relaxed insertions, also thought of humor, reveal the most critical side of the feature, by reiterating that in modernity everyone is subject to therapy. The difference is that society naturally creates hierarchies for this madness present in all of us, something exemplified in the first scene of the debate between the couple in formation, which basically has a disagreement over Pet positioning Tiffany as the craziest between the two.

There are those who say that the film can be irresponsible even so, since it is implied in the happy ending that the therapy between two problematic characters solves more than medical or clinical treatments. However, the narrative seems well aware of this - the happy ending theme is repeated several times in the story and is the motto of the original title -, from the moment it establishes the barrier of the main novel with Pet's idealization of rescuing a marriage that already it was over for a long time before the outbreak that made the character more misunderstood by everyone. You see, he was betrayed, there was no love there between him and Nikki (Brea Bee). All his fight for her is in vain in the romantic sense and this will only be realized when he sees that she, like many others, submits him to the hierarchy of madness, considering that in moral purposes, she was the villain of the story, not he. In a very objective way, the film integrates this as the drama factor within the romance with Tiffany, because that is where, in fact, the romantic idealization characteristic of every romantic comedy film should be.

After being nominated for an Oscar for ""The Fighter"" in 2011, David O. Russell finally completely satisfies me and proves his talent behind the camera. And from a boxing drama to a ""romantic drama"", the sudden change is surprising and I was impressed with the safe direction of O. Russell, who walks with camera in hand through the cast, uses zooms at the right moments (like the great scene in which the protagonist discovers something fundamental about a letter, for example) and even a dynamic scene in the first person in a flashback, which - being placed at a certain moment in the narrative - when applying such a resource, it becomes even more surprising. Such dynamics are maintained during the projection and the skillful editing by Jay Cassidy and Crispin Struthers guarantees a formidable rhythm to the film, providing economy to the scenes of passage in time (such as the quick readings of Pat, who opens a certain book and cuts later the we see him closing and throwing him out of a window) and speed in the dance scenes, without making them incomprehensible by exaggerating the cuts and maintaining their fluidity.

The cast has several highlights. Famous for his Phil in ""The Hangover"", Bradley Cooper quickly ascended in his career as an actor, and now surprises with his incredible dramatic load, although he preserves - with intelligence - a large portion of his comic charisma.

Embodying a guy diagnosed with bipolar disorder, it is remarkable to see the actor's naturalness in suddenly changing his mood, whether to ensure a fun effect, as when his anger suddenly turns into joy when having his physical form praised by another character, or to shock, where the simple search for a video by the character results in him attacking his parents (the great Robert De Niro and the friendly Jacki Weaver). But who really steals the show is the irresistible Jennifer Lawrence. In a nuanced performance (his angry expressions, and a wry laugh at one point, are superb), Lawrence succeeds in showing off Tiffany's notoriety as well as her strength - something he's already done extremely well in ""The Hunger Games"" - which makes the character practically invulnerable exciting. And when the script goes deeper into her soul, we realize her humanity (and hidden feelings) the actress assumes these characteristics with the same dedication, in a touching work.

Pat and Tiffany's relationship is what makes the plot of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" so compelling and fun. Their encounters are unstable and at the same time redemptive. Pat needs subterfuge and a bond with his ex-wife. Tiffany needs a partner for a dance competition. It is in these apparently silly moments, but very close to real life, that Pat and Tiffany will build a fun relationship, with ups and downs and many quirks. ""Watch for the signs"" is what Tiffany tells Pat Solatano several times. Instead of reacting to any situation he should just watch trying to understand.

It's funny to see several self-help elements built into the script of Silver Linings Playbook - including the title in both languages, since in English it is an expression for ""something good found in a bad situation"" - but that within the plot are only pertinent and amusing scenes for those who suffer from bipolar disorder, a diagnosis that is not uncommon nowadays. Bipolar disorder can go from one extreme to the other in a matter of a short time. The film shows the importance of the person always keeping in mind that everything is fleeting, including sadness and memories. But this exaggerated use of positivity can also be bothersome the spectator, mainly because of the repetition in the script of the belief that believing in anything can happen. Not that this is bad, but the film manages to preach a bit of exaggeration in the motto of ""everything is fine in the end if you want it that way"". But as stated earlier, the self-help scenes sound extremely sarcastic and cynical when placed in the context of the characters.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film that assumes the line of clichés precisely to avoid these distorted endorsements in the message. The choice of dance as the great climax is very significant in this sense, because it is the artistic movement that made possible the union of the two, just like the film itself, while another artistic movement - mainly taking into account its genre -, made possible the therapy of two bipolar being among themselves for love and there's nothing irresponsible about it. The climax is memorable and funny, not forced at all. A story about finding love and yourself again, focused on ""Excelsior"", Cooper's key word of positivity repeated throughout the film. Finding humor in depression, without minimizing the problem, O. Russel once again does a commendable job and it's hard not to sympathize with the couple's beautiful development of charisma, with the chemistry of Cooper and Lawrence's performances and performances and not cheer so that both of you have the pleasure of enjoying this good side of life with dignity.",7

I am in my 60s now and more stable than I have ever been in my whole life. My feet are firmly on solid ground, so I think. To portray such a life as I have led in a film of such short duration is masterful if you ask me.

23 December 2012,Wonderfully done.,"A quirky and charming love story.

I don't want to tread over often said compliments. It's been said.

Despite her age, Lawrence easily pulled off a character much older than herself.

Cooper was in fine form with energy and nuance.

I would easily give them both the Oscar based on what I've seen this year, although the Oscars are silly but a decent marker for conversation. (Everyone else was very good, too, except for the brother. That role fell flat.)

Direction was very good. This is probably the only film in memory that I can say hand-held camera was preferred to dolly or tripod shots. There's really not much you can do when it comes to talking heads, though. Some interesting editing in parts that added to the visuals.

Seemed to coast for awhile, though. Was more of the same in many scenes, although that ""same"" was very good banter. But little variation, too.

The transition to the dancing was matter-of-fact. Not quite sure how exactly but that was my gut feeling.

The end was too conventional, too. Predictable.",9

15 January 2013,"A terrific, highly original film with exceptional performances!!!","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
4 April 2021,Rather different look at mental illness.,"Pretty weird film. It's about mental illness, but looks at it in both serious and funny ways. The first half was truly great, fit a lot of different things in it and was pretty fast-paced, but the second half started to focus on other things and stretched them out. I also don't like that it tries to be superstitious whether it is serious or meant to be a joke.

16 January 2013,Last film watched: Silver Linings Playbook - 10/10,"Pat Solitano leaves a mental institution and attempts to integrate himself back into normal society. Bradley Cooper plays the leading role and he smashes it out of the park. In any other year he should be nailed on for best actor Oscar, Day-Lewis will win it of course. Jennifer Lawrence cements her reputation as the best actress working in Hollywood right now with her crushingly beautiful performance as the damaged Tiffany. Robert De Niro gives his best performance in years and has some of the funniest lines. The script has many laugh out loud moments but is also heartbreaking and up lifting, touching on mental health, alienation, longing, love, family, how sport and dance can bring people together and people's attitude to mental illness (particularly the authorities). As someone who worked in mental health for a while I felt that the issues faced by Bradley Cooper and his reaction to them were portrayed perfectly. No film has touched me on so many levels as this one did for years. It also has the most iconic dance sequence since Pulp Fiction IMO and a great soundtrack. Director David O. Russell has come a long way since Three Kings and it is going to be nigh on impossible for him to follow the huge success of The Fighter and now this. If you only watch one the films nominated for Best Picture at this years Oscars make it this one.",9
19 January 2022,Twisted and Beautiful,"Finally got to see this on Netflix. Really good story and great acting from a superb cast, could connect with almost all the characters. There have been a lot of movies about bipolar, very few as good as this, I speak from experience.

12 April 2013,"Led by David O. Russell's strong writing and direction, Silver Linings Playbook is a powerfully acted, meaningful little movie.","In 2010, director David O. Russell ended his six year absence, and returned to the big screen with his knock-out hit (No pun intended) The Fighter, which managed a grand total of seven Oscar nominations, including wins for actors Christian Bale and Melissa Leo. Flash forward two years later, and his next movie is up for a whopping eight nominations, also setting a record as one of the only movies to ever have nominations in all four acting categories. That movie is Silver Linings Playbook. I've been anticipating this one for months, ever since it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Let me just say it didn't disappoint.

Inspired by Matthew Quick's book, Silver Linings Playbook follows Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), a man released from a stay in a mental institution after catching his wife cheating on him, and beating her lover to near death. He's staying with his caring and worrisome mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver), and his obsessive compulsive Eagles fan father (Robert De Niro). Pat is hopeful, despite a restraining order, that he'll be able to reconcile his marriage, and that's only one of the problems that are running around in his mind.

As bad as Pat's problems are, he's got nothing on Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a recently widowed woman with whom Pat finds a kindred spirit. Tiffany strikes up a deal. If pat will compete in a dance competition alongside Tiffany, she'll deliver a letter to his wife explaining about his current situation.

Much like our central character, the movie is understandably prone to certain mood swings, balancing out between personal drama and laces of dark humor. This is a very personal movie for Russell, known for his own history of off screen controversy. The ease with the dramatic pace of this movie, the issues of familial turmoil, our main character's quest to reconstruct his life, the well timed wit, and a whole slew of fascinating characters is only part of what's done excellently by Russell, who drew upon his own experiences and that of his own son in writing the script. The mental issues are met properly, but through Russell's eyes, we also get to witness the vices of many of the other characters here, which ensure that the movie never gets boring.

Just as strong as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said of the man, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief role.

But I know who you all really want to ask me about: Jennifer. Lawrence. I can say absolutely nothing about her that hasn't already been said. She steals this movie, serving as that perfect match for Cooper. The best parts of this movie are when we get to see the irresistible chemistry between these two, and Lawrence sells them all convincingly. This is such a peculiar, but very warm, sincere, and charming performance. One of her strengths is how well she conveys Tiffany's emotion, but at certain times, she'll even play it up to convey several at one time. She has one specific scene in a diner that left me unsure of how to feel towards her. Pitying, tickled, intimidated, uncomfortable? It's not common when I find a performance like that that makes me feel so many different things all at once. Lawrence is far and away one of the best performances of the year!

As such, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best movies of the year, allowing O. Russell to stretch his legs with a challenge, and unqualified success. It's a sweet and meaningful little movie that should resonate deeply with many a member of its audience. Now if only Ernest Hemingway would stop triggering such negative reactions...

11 March 2013,Not so good....,"I watched this film last night, and I can say, I expected more from the movie nominated for Oscar award,and the movie with high marks. It is in a way different from other romantic comedies but, I think the director lost himself somewhere between drama and comedy. Neither of them was successful. It reminds me of some other movies in some scenes, like Hangover, or similar movies. The actors are also nothing special, De Niro, already seen in Analyze This....The atmosphere of the film is all the time funny but the theme is pretty serious. It doesn't deserve the marks it has. We don't see why the protagonist has so many problems with rage and violence. His wife and her behavior is the cause but not the reason for all the trouble.

3 January 2022,Adored it!,"Such a great movie, I've watched it several times already and every time I enjoy it so much. Of course Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence always deliver well their roles in movis up until now, so you know you'll get something minimally good. But they just worked so well together on this one. The caracters are definitely akward and weird, and they will make you feel uncomfortable through the movie. But the growth from the beggining to the end of the story makes it worth it. There's also a bunch of great actors for the secondary roles. It's a good drama/romance, and not too cheesy as it can be. Must see!!

14 January 2013,"""Silver Linings"" is a fantastically refreshing, Oscar-worthy screwballer","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a rare kind of film. It's a difficult task to honestly and realistically present characters who are struggling deeply with heavy issues, without tipping over into emotional goo and sentimentality But David O. Russell is the man for the job, expertly leading four of his talented actors to Oscar nominations in a film that gives a delightfully raw edge to screwball comedy. Bradley Cooper stars as a recently released mental patient, trying to put his life back together and reunite with his estranged wife with the help of a similarly struggling Jennifer Lawrence, who is recovering from the death of her husband. Their relationship buds and grows around their practice for a dance competition that Lawrence wants to dance in, and around Philadelphia Eagles football. Co-starring Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, ""Silver Linings"" is a quirky, affecting love story about the power of staying optimistic and the strength of family bonds, brimming with characters you want to cheer for. That I wouldn't be at all upset if this poignant comedy took home Best Picture, in a year of so many fine candidates, should be enough to get you to go see it today.

15 April 2013,worst of worst!,"I did not find anything interesting or talented in this movie. Predictable scenario, boring people! It received an Oscar, well, check the other movies of 2012, cannot find one little better than the others except Life of Pi! Did I mention that this movie was boring? I should write 10 lines of text describing how this movie was boring but do not want to waste your time with it. Actor or actress, who is more crazy and troubled than the other? Have I watched anything like that before, well hundred of times and were they boring either? a handful of them were not. But most important, earlier movies had such troubled characters had won Oscars only and only if the movie and the stars deserved it. Silver Linings Playbook received Oscar ----- very cheap!!!!!

2012 was nightmare for movie lovers!

13 June 2014,Urban neurotics,"Cooper is almost believable as some kind of crazy-eyed (though functional) neurotic, with an unpredictable demeanour whose quest to win back his estranged wife detours in an unexpected direction when he seeks to exploit her recently widowed sister to 'broker' the reconciliation. As the two spend more time in each other's company, a mutual attraction blossoms and while it's a predictable outcome, it's not without moments of endearment.

The concept is fine and some of the whacky characterisations are stand- outs (Chris Tucker in particular), but I found the dialogue at times seemed too sophisticated, or perhaps self-indulgent, like a poor-man's Woody Allen movie where everyone exhibited a varying degree of neuroticism and always had something prophetic to announce with just the right sense of timing. Jennifer Lawrence is clearly a capable actress, confident and sultry, but at times I felt she in particular suffered most from the self-aware dialogue and it made her character uneven as a result.

There are some quirky characterisations in both Tucker and Wigham's roles, and while DeNiro's presence elevates the prestige of an otherwise small-scale movie as a middle-class Jewish, sport-loving patriarch, I still felt the material was well beneath his capabilities – more subtlety on the page was desperately needed at times. Weaver's part as the seemingly docile, traditional-domesticated wife I just couldn't grasp – the erratic accent and a role so minor I was struggling to comprehend why all the hyperventilating concerning her portrayal; how she'd scored an Oscar nomination for such an innocuous performance eludes me.

Despite my criticisms, it's still very watchable and not without genuine interest, just not what I would label a great film worthy of the plaudits it garnered on its premiere; one of those films where some of the individual components display more promise than the overall result actually achieves. In short, it's a good movie but not a great movie.",6
30 September 2022,A Must See,"A delightful movie filled with heart and soul, Silver Linings Playbook is a film which has everything in it for everyone. The cast all around deliver stellar performances, with my favourite being Bradley Cooper's Pat. Robert De Niro's chemistry with Bradley Cooper onscreen was heartwarmingly beautiful. Jennifer Lawrence's deservedly oscar winning performance was also an acting spectacle. What stood out to me the most, were the heartful moments, it connotes to the idea of life's bittersweet moments, funny moments, and romantic moments, almost as if watching an expressionalist documentary, purely visceral. Hands down one of the 2010' best!

On the other hand Bradley cooper was great as a bipolar guy. I think the mental illness was depicted very well. But I wouldn't call this movie a comedy. It wasn't very fun. It's entertaining but I didn't laugh out loud that much. It's a nice love story however,

10 November 2012,A thoroughly enjoyable film,"I hesitated a moment before writing, since other reviews already here seem right on target. But, I will say, briefly, that the movie kept me laughing, moved, and totally attentive for its entire length. The spontaneity moment by moment is striking to experience as a film viewer, and gives a feeling of overall vitality. Since I am studying psychology, it was refreshing to see individuals with emotional challenges portrayed coping and trying to grow. It seems portrayed in a realistic manner, neither too easy nor too depressing or defeatist. Just real.

Bravo to the creators of this film. I give it a 9 not a 10 because it does not really touch on eternal existential themes of survival as the greatest classics do, but as a romantic comedy/drama it seems to be at or near the top of the category.

6 May 2013,Romance or Bi-polar disorder--Movie with an Identity crisis,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment. The plot is unsure of itself, the acting adequate but not great, and the Philadelphia Eagles angle is poorly executed.

We meet Pat right off the bat when his mother shows up at the mental hospital to take him home, where we then meet his father (Robert DeNiro). Within ten minutes their characters are easily discernible-- mom is the peacemaker; dad is OCD, a huge Eagles fan, and prone to get in a fight or two. Pat is bi-polar, refuses to take any medication, and is living in a constant state of anxiety.

The mental illness at the heart of the first half of the film disappears about the time Pat agrees to take medication, at which point it becomes a romance. (supposedly it's a comedy too, but until the closing scenes there was little that was laugh-worthy). Pat begins a relationship(refreshingly chaste) with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), agreeing to be her dance partner in an upcoming competition in exchange for her doing him a favor regarding his ex-wife.

The second half of the movie is dominated by a combination of Eagles football, which Pat's father worships, and the growing friendship between Pat and Tiffany. Unfortunately, none of the Eagles drama rings true if you live in the Philly area, as I do. Philadelphians have a distinct accent which goes undetected in DeNiro's portrayal.

Sadly the schizophrenic plot, the stilted and rough execution of lines, and the lack of a genuine Philly feel outweigh the the satisfactory ending. Overall, this film was not horrible, but not very good either. I can only guess that the Academy smiled upon Silver Linings Playbook because of the mental health angle. Wish that had been more fully explored within the context of the second half of the film.

The 'R' rating is for a conversation in the diner between Pat and Tiffany regarding a sexual experience she had, for partial nudity in a flashback scene, and for numerous uses of the f-word.",5
17 November 2015,Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the true revelations of this grounded testament on love and complex relationships,"Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent testament on family and complicated relationships uprooted unpleasant circumstances. It is charming story of love between two people find each other's in odd and and unexpected points in their lives. Who is a better director than David O. Russell to tackle on his ingenious tale? That's right, the famed director of the comedy 'Three Kings' and the dramas 'I Heart Huckabees' and 'The Fighter', operates with soaring humanity on bringing together this heart-stirring tale based on the Matthew Quick's 2008 novel of the same name. It is not your average romantic tale that Hollywood has helmed thousands of times to the point where two strangers fall in love and everything from there contributes to a formulaic trajectory before leading to a ""happily ever after"" conclusion. Here, things are a little more complicated than that, and that is where actor Bradley Cooper and actress Jennifer Lawrence come into to play, striking at the heart with performances that are too difficult to ignore. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man suffering from bipolar disorder and has somewhat frequent mood swings. His life takes a turn for the worse when he comes home to find his wife Nikki cheating on him with another man. After delivering the man a vicious beating, Nikki kicks out Pat of the house and files for divorce. After spending a few months in a psychiatric hospital, Pat moves in with his parents (played by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver). In the meantime, he tries to rekindle his relationship with his now ex-wife, but this proves to be impossible since she's put him under a restraining order. One night, he is invited to a dinner where he meets a troubled young woman named Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's husband is dead and is living with her parents and sister Veronica (played by Julia Stiles). Pat and Tiffany began bonding and form a relationship, while learning that they both share the similar problems.

In a world where romantic dramas are often lie on the groundwork of run-of-the-mill formula, David O. Russell doesn't believe in pounding filmgoers on the head with overblown sentimentality or expectations. Instead, he offers more of an emotional build-up of a complex relationship rather than just going for the skill with sizzling the story of an endless cycle of hugs, kisses, and melodramatic disputes. What he does is challenge the viewers with a story between two characters that starts out as simple bond with no hints of love interest peeking in sight. In fact, as the story progresses, it digs the deep into the emotional problems two characters face in their lives that make seem almost impossible that a congruent relationship will likely brew. Bradley Cooper's Pat is emotionally disturbed by his past marriage that ended in an unhealthy note, while Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is a tragic character who feels lost in a world where everyone fails to make sense of her dilemmas. The truth is neither of them are more messed up than the other. As the two grow closer and closer, that is when the emotional resonance hits. And the chemistry between the two would not work as sufficiently without the genuine performances by Cooper and Lawrence, both of whom ground their roles with strong gravitas. Although their inflated age gap may their relationship a little difficult to buy into, these two Hollywood veterans know how to make things work, as does Robert De Niro who delivers a smear of charm as Bradley Cooper's father. Let's also not forget an unexpected appearance by Chris Tucker who been's off the map in several years following his departure from the 'Rush Hour' franchise, but it makes a sweet effort to return for a minor role as a dance teacher late in the film.

Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent cinematic effort that shows Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence embraces their talent with amazing fortitude, and David O. Russell maturely tackling on a story that never feels hammy or contrived in any way. It is a film that taps at the heart while never shifting the light away from the admirable talent on and offscreen, and it all deserves your attention.",8
5 February 2021,Fabulous role playing by actors !,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

30 June 2021,Crazy but mostly in a good way,"As a 700-level season ticket holder for 9 hard years they definitely got the Eagles fans right and the Philly locations are fantastic (including the Media theater!). There are two parts of the movie I like best 1) on Halloween when they're in the diner and suddenly the music turns creepy; and 2) the last thirty minutes of the movie, which make the whole thing work.

11 December 2013,Not Exactly a Silver Lining...,"But there is something there! The main actors: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence (who is now riding the Hunger Games train), Jacki Weaver, and Robert De Niro; each gave a good performance! However, I think that had it been Julia Styles as Tiffany, perhaps the film would have been enhanced; definitely the dance part would have been much better (Save the Last Dance 2001). I know that Bradley Cooper is the current idol, but De Niro takes the cake – he held the movie for me.

I like the idea that Ballroom dancing was used as the antidote and healing process, and to get people closer too. It may be different from the book, but the message is clear to me. Too many people are classed as bipolar and institutionalized, more so than people who are on drugs or alcohol and really need the hospitalization. Physical activity such as jogging, walking and above all dancing which provides social inter- change is better. The music was not that great, the dance choreography not the most interesting, but I guess it was the maximum that these two actors could master. I gave it an 8 because of some of the actors.",8
17 April 2013,One of the most entertaining Oscar nominated movies of all time!,"Silver Linings Playbook is the story of Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper) who struggles with bipolar disorder. After Pat gets picked up from a mental institution by his mother, Dolores(Jacki Weaver) he tries to put his life back on track. The reason he was put into the mental institution was because he almost killed the guy his wife slept with. Pat's dad, Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro) is unsure if Pat is over his manic days. Along the way, Pat meets Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence), who is a widow. Once they start spending more time with each other, they realize that they have a lot in common.

This is one of the best romantic comedies I've watched recently. Cooper & Lawrence share great chemistry together. A note on the performances. Bradley Cooper is outstanding as Pat. In his first dramatic role, Cooper's acting has improved substantially since The Hangover films & Limitless. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in her portrayal of Tiffany. She deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. Robert De Niro & Jacki Weaver are excellent as Pat Sr. & Dolores respectively. Chris Tucker is effective as Danny. Anupam Kher is mind blowing in his small but substantial role of Pat's psychologist Dr.Cliff Patel. All in all, Silver Linings Playbook gives you your money's worth of entertainment.",10
22 August 2020,over-rated,"In Philadelphia, a young adult man (Bradley Cooper) moves in with his parents after he has completed an eight-month term in a mental institution in Baltimore. In his parents' neighbourhood, he connects with a young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who also has mental health problems.

The film begins well with some comical moments. It has some good scenes but also some troubling ones. The main character's father (Robert De Niro) is a betting addict - often a difficult plot point in any film - and a scene in which he goes over-the-top has too much hysteria (among other scenes).

There are mixed feelings about the grand finale which includes a dance contest. In many ways, it was superbly executed but sadly, the outcomes were formulaic and predictable.

Cooper is certainly a good actor and does a fine job in this film. It is a demanding burden for him, however, that he is in every scene in the film. As good as Cooper is, he seems over-exposed at times.

Lawrence is credited with a leading role but she does not spend nearly as much time on screen as Cooper does. Her performance is the greatest asset to this film. She shows the same sharpness here as she did in ""Winter's Bone"". It is a delight every time she is on the screen. The great veteran De Niro also has some fine moments in reflecting on times when his children were younger.

This film (written and directed by David O. Russell) missed an opportunity in exploring further into a neighbourhood couple who are high-achieving and materialistic while falling apart emotionally. This would have made a good subplot.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" was finely directed and acted but, like many films, its script could have been better. - dbamateurcritic",6
8 August 2020,"Accurate , not predictable","Very accurate view how bipolar people work, the whole film moves through different fustrations , and problems. As a person who suffered from mania depression , hit me , and had to stop many times. As it was labelled comedy , but it is not .its happy and beautiful , depressing and upsetting.

7 June 2015,Good TV Movie,"I saw this on TV and was good to watch because of the all star cast.

As much as I like Bradley Cooper I cant believe he suffers from any mental illness in this movie. Brad Cooper is more the all time hero good guy that everyone loves and not believable as someone having mental illness.

Also I cant believe the ending either. There was no build up to the ending and Brad Cooper again is unbelievable in the ending.

Maybe Im being a bit harsh because I've seen all Brads other movies which were great ! and thats what Im used to. This one is like 90% of his best effort. However hes still worth seeing anyway.

Nevertheless apart from that its more of an interesting story and De Niro is brilliant as always.

Watch it for the interesting story and overall a good strong cast of A List Actors.",7
10 May 2021,Love story too abrupt and too unnatural.,"Why does Tiffany keep trying with unstable Pat while it was just one time thing with all the other guys the past? Why does Patrizio suddenly change the direction from football to couple's dancing and bet all his share impractically? Why does Pat leave Tiffany so suddenly after the dance even though he was already in love with her? All these unanswered questions could have been easily answered if the flow of the story is logical or at least sensible. Russell's script is very hasty, sudden, and aggressive.

Patrizio senior's abrupt change of passion from football to dancing is to make couple dance just for the movie's sake. Pat leaving Tiffany so suddenly after the dance and not telling his true feeling for a week, which is not congruent with Pat we've known for the whole hour of the movie is to make dramatic ending. Tiffany who goes through serious behavioral change after her husband's death and who does not seem to overcome the sadness caused by it suddenly chases after another guy because they are the two protagonists (very clear even from the poster). All the weaknesses mentioned can be attributed to the fact that 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romance movie. This genre of film is sometimes the collection of coincidences, and its ending is foreseeable from the start. However, many romantic films overpower these problems by building the chemistry between a couple deliberately and romantically. However, I have to say this one does everything so sudden and artificial.",7
5 August 2018,What the heck was that?,"It was this a comedy? Because I didn't laugh once (maybe once on a rude comment here and there). Was this a realistic movie about mental problems? Of course not. Was this an original mix of genres with great writing? No. It has cliché romance, cliché father/son problems. Cliché violent guy problems. All together with a cliché ending.

The only ""different"" thing is the performances of mentally unstable people by the gorgeous leads... That's it.

It is terrible and overrated

12 August 2013,Interesting concept!,"One of the best films I've seen this year. The fact that both Pat and Tiffany are equally as damaged and have experienced similar tragic events prior to meeting makes for some very hilarious, yet compelling scenes. Two people who are seen as clinically insane by many people around them and have strong sexual tension between each other proved to be very entertaining! This movie was the perfect balance of funny, sweet and sad. When I was first introduced to the film I was expecting more of a ""chick flick"" (i had not yet read the synopsis) however I was pleasantly surprised with the interesting concept. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

18 January 2013,"Not Your Average Romantic Comedy... Quirky, Gritty, Moving, and Sublime!","Beautiful movie; I loved it! It's not your average romantic comedy. The story, the characters, their bonding, the situations - the whole screenplay is quirky, gritty, moving, and sublime. It doesn't get so intense, with a tinge of humour always in the air.

Everyone's unique and a little bit nuts, in their own way. No matter how different and crazy you are, there's always someone out there who's equally different and can match your craziness with their own.

The casting is outstanding; it's rare to find such a remarkable ensemble. Bradley Cooper is fantastic and compelling; his most natural character till date. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant; she always amazes me with the range of emotions and characters she can handle. Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver complete the terrific ensemble, with their magnetic presence. Julia Stiles, Chris Tucker and Anupam Kher also do interesting cameos.

In an era, where most romantic comedies are melodramatic, over the top and unbelievable, 'Silver Linings Playbook' sets the bar for how intelligent, well-acted and charming romantic comedies can be.",8
3 February 2013,"A fascinating, witty romantic comedy with multiple layers","I had heard so much hype about this movie that I finally caved in and went to see it. I have to say, for the most part, it lived up to my expectations, and even exceeded them in some cases. David O. Russell does a solid, and at times surprisingly inventive job at directing a story about a formally undiagnosed bipolar man trying to reconnect with his estranged wife while balancing a relationship with a younger girl who has problems of her own. He also wrote the screenplay, based off of the novel by Matthew Quick.

Although the story itself is not entirely original, the performances elevate to a much higher level, and they managed to consistently impress as the film played on. Jennifer Lawrence is captivatingly hysterical as Tiffany, the crazy girl next door who is attempting to deal with her husband's untimely death. She has many great one-liners and was able to display a fantastic range of emotions, but her performance was actually the only one that, to a certain degree, let me down. Don't get me wrong—she's amazing, but with all I had heard and with all the accolades she's been receiving, I expected her to be even better than she was.

The standout, for me, was Bradley Cooper, who was far better than I thought he could ever be as Pat Solitano, a man obsessed with impressing his wife after their relationship, somewhat traumatically, came to an end. His ability to switch quickly between numerous emotions— from anger to happiness to regret, and so on—was truly outstanding, and what I believe to be a pretty accurate portrayal of someone struggling with bipolar disorder. Additionally, his unrealistic belief that everything will work out well—in terms of his relationship with his wife, his parents, and Tiffany—provides a sort of comic irony as everything constantly spirals out of control.

That's not all, though. Robert De Niro was—finally—very good, and undeniably compelling, as the OCD, football-obsessed father who just wants his family to spend time together again. Also, Jacki Weaver does a fine job as the matriarch trying to hold her family together, and Chris Tucker provides comic relief, as if it were needed, as Pat's friend from the hospital. Rounding out the cast are Julia Stiles, John Ortiz, and Anupam Kher (who's actually pretty funny as Pat's psychiatrist).

At the end of it all, this film is a wild, comical, if not slightly predictable ride made all the more better by the fantastic chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence. While its main focus is on building and maintaining relationships, it provides glimpses into the thought processes of some completely irrational, oversensitive, and easily aggravated people, which at times can be stressful, and other times just downright hilarious. Because of this, it's definitely deeper and more complex than most romantic comedies, while at the same time remaining captivating and entertaining throughout. And really, if films are truly made to entertain us, then this more than succeeds on all accounts.",8

6 February 2013,Is it really that good? ... No!,"I just saw this movie and I found it in line of mediocrity.

I didn't buy the idea of all that absurdity about bets and superstitions. I didn't like the comedy inside, since the proposal here is to show that serious mental problems. I didn't like the lack of sense on the attitudes of the characters. And definitely I didn't like how they solve the movie, with that suppose professional dance contest.

Each of the elements above are not the problem. But this mix is a receipt that screwed.

The performances are good, but this plot didn't help all the talent involved.

This movie was full of boring dialogs, nonsense decisions and it is not funny.

4 January 2016,Do not waste your time.,"Truly awful, I felt cheated once the film ended that I actually wasted my time watching it. The whole time I was waiting for the film to hit me with a twist or something exciting, but it was totally predictable. My husband loves a good romantic film..but he couldn't even sit through it!

No real chemistry between Bradley and Jennifer, shame when they are meant to be portraying two people in love.

No real story line, lightly touches on mental health, but no real explanation or focus on it.

Plus you predict the story in the beginning! Honestly don't waste your time. Disappointing! No idea how it won an Oscar!!

6 April 2020,Turning Silver into Golds,"I was recently diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. It was fun watching this movie and being able to draw on parallels with the main character Pat. It was interesting seeing his behavior in his manic state because I could draw parallels between his behavior and my own behaviors. Pat fixates all his attention on his ex-wife while I focused all of my attention on my father. I now have a visual of mania from a third person perspective and I feel empowered knowing that I never want to go back to that full blown state. Ok well maybe I will go back to that state sometime because it is enjoyable but then again that is just the inner demon that some people with bipolar need to deal with and defeat in order to have a steadfast commitment to stay in the bipolar wellness zone.

I loved seeing Pat agreeing to take his pills because of the normality that he was able to create while on his pills. The manic state can be very addicting so I am happy to have seen him understand that he was supposed to take his pills. Mental illness is real and effects everyone who loves you so it is just plain selfish to refuse to take your prescribed medicine.

This movie has everything that anyone could ever want, Drama, romance and dynamic characters. I highly recommend it especially if you want to get better grasp on understanding mental illness and how the mentally ill and their families are effected by it. Silver linings playbook is a must watch for anyone interested in psychology or anyone who wants a romantic drama with twists and turns that will be sure to keep them on the edge of their seat.",9

This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",7

9 April 2022,Beautiful love story between two strange people 7/10,"Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are one heck of a dynamic duo. When it comes to drama films directed by David O. Russell then you know it's going to be good with both of them on screen.

Pat (Cooper) and Tiffany (Lawrence) are two people who struggle with mental illness, each one with a different illness. Throughout the story the hang out together and help each other out in the final act of the film. (Which is also the best sequence of the film).

Along with the soundtrack by Danny Elfman, there are many very good songs such as Steve Wonder's great hits.

The dance scenes are well done, a lot choreography put into the dances and are among the better scenes among the film.

Another shout-out goes to Robert DeNiro who is wonderful and tears in a emotional scene between father and son.

Finally, I love the focus on the mental illness each character faces throughout the story, it is purposely done to give more insight to the characters and get to know them better. Even DeNiro's character suffers from O. C. D which is well planted in the movie.

Silver Lining Playbook is a great romance movie between two very different people who work well together once they finally come to terms with each other. Gotta love the chemistry between them.

By the way, speaking of this film, remember that time during the scene where Tiffany yells at Pat during Halloween?, after finishing the scene, Russell just comes up and shouts he love cinema. That's how I feel about movies.",7
6 December 2013,Another Great Film Under David O. Russell's Direction,"After The Fighter, Hollywood and the general public has restored their faith on David O. Russell and this allowed him to have more choices in his projects. Silver Linings Playbook is definitely a film he wanted to make, as he wrote the screenplay and the plot and premise is quite risky in comparison to his previous film, The Fighter.

Silver Linings Playbook is written by David O. Russell. Russell mostly writes the screenplays of his films and when a director also writes the film, it also allows the director to have a connection to the script that the actors or anybody else in the production may not have. Russell has simply written a dramedy, if you look at the big picture but what makes it so unique and interesting is the fact that it touches on the topic of mental illness and explores beyond what has already been covered in mainstream film of mental illness.When I first watched this film, I thought the dialogue between characters and the personalities they project were hard to empathise and sympathise with but as with each viewing, and an increase awareness in mental illness during my degree, allowed me to realise that Russell has written a script that is so faithful to reality and that people who suffer mental illness have sometimes a complete different perception of oneself and his or her surroundings. The characters are very self-centered and only cater to themselves but this just adds on to the sense of reality with these characters allowing it to feel natural. The film explores the themes of mental illness, love, commitment, and relationships. The film at times also touches on the social stigma on mental illness.

David O. Russell has proved to be one of the great directors in this decade with two films gaining critical acclaim, with his next film being much more ambitious than the previous two (American Hustle). Russell clearly wanted to make a dramedy but due to its subject matter, it makes the film feel fresh and stand out from other films in the same pile. I am so happy that Russell has taken a positive approach to this film as films touching mental illness, in most cases, is seen in a negative light and it isn't fair as many people who are ""diagnosed"" with mental illness has lived a happy and successful life. Russell during the third act does dip into a cliché territory but with everything that has happened throughout the film it's nice to see something campy. Russell approaches all characters in the film with a mental illness, at times it may seem like it's a natural thing and that we do it too but modern medicine has used these little things as a criteria for diagnosis. This film may feel different and lose it's accessibility if it was handled by a different director.

Masanobu Takayanagi is the cinematographer for this film. Takayanagi does a good job for this film, allowing the film to feel and look accessible which is essential in the film's uniqueness. Though David O. Russell has chosen a different DP for this film, it still has the same style as The Fighter; but without the television broadcast effect. The film is mostly shot hand-held allowing us to feel like we are standing or present near the characters allowing us to feel involved in the conversation and story. There are shots that I have noticed that Russell has used in The Fighter, though this is the second film I have seen from his it may be a trademark shot or scene that is common within his films.

Danny Elfman is a hard working composer, working on a number of films in the past few years. Elfman doesn't have a huge impact in this film because like The Fighter, Russell loves to use soundtracks in particular moments to enhance the scene. I did enjoy the fact that the music choices for the climax scenes matches the emotions of the characters during the film. Elfman may not have a huge impact in the film or at least his score is not as noticeable but when it does come on it works so well that it uplifts us or it haves us in tears. The use of the piano in the defining moment between Pat and Tiffany at the end or the uplifting guitars in the running scenes.

David O. Russell is an actor's director and is always able to bring out the best and unique performances from the actors in his films even if they are not leads. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper felt natural together and the chemistry was great. Both leads portray characters with mental illness was believable but at the same time, with Russell's direction, allowing to be accessible. De Niro, Weaver, and Tucker are so great. When they have their moments, it's converts you to believing that they are great actors, or in De Niro's case seeing that he still has it. It was also nice to see Julia Stiles in films as it has been a while for me that I have seen her.

Russell has made an excellent film to put in his resume and I think this film will definitely will stand the test of time. It is filled with great performances, supported by the awards that the film has won, and it has great direction from Russell. If it didn't have stiff competition with the ambitious films of 2012 then this may be the best film of that year.",9
19 August 2014,Good,"Its complexity begins within its characters. After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. The content isn't for everyone. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The movie has enough to keep you entertained and the directing and cinematography are well done. A little too slow-paced for a film. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study.

18 April 2013,"Wonderful smart quirky heartwarming romantic tale of love, redemption, + craziness","This really is a great movie- a tour de force by Jennifer Lawrence, who has exploded out of the gate (meatiest woman's role since Mulholland Drive), but Cooper is brilliant too, even DeNiro and Tucker are good, whom I usually find tiring- DeNiro is the most human I've ever seen him as a neurotic superstitious compulsive bookie who has passed on his problems to his son (like Claire's dad in ""Homeland""), and finally makes one forget the Good Fellas' scumbags; + Tucker doesn't do that gay scream. America's mistreatment of men is manifest- you get sent to loony bin for beating up some guy ravishing your wife in your shower??? Russell truly deserved an Oscar too for writing or directing this very smart, wordy, brilliant script. But it is crazy slutty tough tender erotic glib wounded gamin JL (her cop husband has been killed), who shines in every scene. I didn't want to see a movie about manic-depressive or OCD ""nuts"", my father was the latter, but Cooper and Lawrence are so funny and entertaining, and really admirable, AND Russell slickly tapers down the harrowing wildness (suspiciously so in Lawrence's case- she ain't taking meds?) till you love these people. She obviously was a real dancer (if that wasn't body doubles), and has the rubber physicality and athleticism (like say Jessica Alba) previously evident in Hunger Games, that is very sexy and allows her to morph into different characters and moods.

The ending is surprising and really wonderful, and the entire cast, from the lip-biting worried mother, to the stolid brah, to the dubiously patient parole cop, to the football-mad Indian shrink are tremendously likable and appealing. Check this out- for woman it is really romantic; for men it is has sports arcana galore and JL; for business it has the power of positive thinking; for families it displays the infinite value of true loyalty, love, and support; for film buffs it is a superbly crafted and inspirational tale.",
30 January 2013,A movie worth watching at last...,"A good script, great acting, great dialogs(!). All the components that make a great movie are here. I had heard from movie critics that this was not a very original scenario and I did not expect the movie to be as good as it turned out to be. I am very glad that finally Hollywood produced a movie with characters who have depth. Bradley Cooper was an excellent choice for this film, and he is really worth the Oscar nomination as his performance is graded 10 out of 10. All the cast, down to the last man (or woman), have been chosen perfectly for their part. Finally someone is beginning to do good work again in Hollywood-land...I hope we see more movies like this in the future.

1 July 2014,Definitely a movie with replay value.,"Interesting and memorable dramedy about an emotionally scarred pair, one with bipolar disorder who is recently released from a psychiatric hospital (Cooper) and the other a young widow (Lawrence). The two leads do an excellent job of showing their characters' instability without ever being overly-dramatic or pity-party about it. The story is grounded in reality very well, but the romantic climax falls into place a little too easily. De Niro, Herman, Kher, Mihok, Ortiz, Stiles, Tucker and Whigham are all terrific in their supporting roles, but it seems like Weaver might let her Australian accent slip and is definitely not convincing as a Philly homemaker. Based on the book by Matthew Quick. Definitely a movie with replay value. Captures the difficulty of living with bipolar very well and how it also interferes with loved ones.

***½ (out of four)

10 February 2014,A very good thought-provoking movie.,"Although this is a really good movie I feel like now that I have watched it for a second time the rose-coloured glasses have come off. I too watched the movie at the cinemas and got conned into thinking it was a true masterpiece. Turns out that's not true. While the characters are fantastic the plot drags in a fair few places and I found myself thinking that this movie really should not have been 2 hours long.

It is incredibly interesting though to have an insight into people suffering from bipolar disorder as it is still misunderstood. As you see people's awkward reactions and lack of understanding it makes you really feel for people with bipolar and other mental disorders.

Now this may not have lived up to the hype but it still is a very good movie with a thought- provoking underlying message.

29 December 2012,Exceeded My Expectations on Every Level,"I go to movies for A) a good story,B) to watch transformational actors and C) being hopelessly drawn in to a world that is both none of my own making, but resonating and breathing with universal emotional connection and humanity. And this film was like having all of my own emotions placed in a Cuisinart and processed on ""high."" And I mean that in the best possible way. Bradley Cooper, whose other films I'd never seen was a strong pivotal character who never had a break. Even when focused on others like Mr. DeNiro, Brad was always in the background. DeNiro and Jennifer Lawrence were superb, as were all the supporting cast members. The only time the film lost its grip for me was when Jennifer's character, Tiffany, who had previously proclaimed no interest football, gave a performance not unlike Marisa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinny,"" when she suddenly became an unstoppable informed witness on Pontiac tires. Tiffany had a similar moment where she took over the living room with a huge and informed monologue about football. That said, it was integral to the plot and the remainder of the story. I loved the visuals of the Halloween revelers, the diner scene (which I anticipated with both anxiousness and child-like glee) and of course the ever-present Christmas theme (almost can't make a movie without-certainly not a romantic one.) Pretend we are talking about wine. This film had tones of the 1970's with its sloppy and scrappy humanity, Bradley Cooper could have been Woody Allen in some scenes, and the therapy scenes recalled ""Ordinary People."" A great movie about life, love, family and crazy people which is never maudlin, nor preachy. The acting, directing, and cinematography was all perfectly meshed. I suspect there will be awards.",9
1 September 2022,A sweet story of an unlikely romance.,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012) follows a man who is released from a psychiatrist hospital and tries to get back with his ex-wife, however he ends up meeting a woman who's just as damaged as he is. This was a beautiful film that I related to deeply and I'm so glad I watched it! The performances were all great and I was impressed.

The personal reason I loved this film was because I'm bipolar and this movie really made me feel understood. For me, the depiction of bipolar disorder was so realistic and well written, especially the mania. I feel like media has really struggled to give a realistic portrayal of mania in the past so I genuinely appreciated this movie for that!

We are introduced to the characters well and the acting all around was pretty good! Bradley Cooper was great in his role and really put his all into it, and Jennifer Lawrence was just as good. They both had amazing chemistry and although their relationship was very self-destructive, I couldn't help but root for them!

I wasn't a fan of the music at times because it felt like it sometimes broke the mood and was a bit too overbearing and odd. However, some of the music used did reflect the emotions well so it wasn't too big an issue. I thought the score itself was beautiful and added more life to the film!

The cinematography was, for the most part, pretty basic and I wish that there would've been some better colour schemes. The lighting was good though and I liked the use of quick zooms! Also, nearer the end the cinematography got a lot stronger and there were some really nice colour palettes.

The film wasn't massively engaging but it was easy to follow and the pacing was steady with a plot that builds up well. There were plenty of stressful and tense scenes. The second half was a lot better than the first, and I felt like the final act really saved the movie. The final dance sequence was my favourite part of the film as it was funny but also heartwarming! The film ended on an emotional note, which I really loved.",7
23 February 2013,"Cooper Plays Pat With Such Believability We Begin Pitying His Character, So Much That We Are Left Dissatisfied With The Resolution The Film Offers Him","There is a thin line of difference between 'eccentric' and 'unstable': Pat Solitano, a victim of bi-polar disorder behaved more unstable than eccentric or quirky, and so I pitied him instead of loving him. Bradley Cooper has Pat's uncontrollable anxiety down to a tee and he plays his character with great sincerity because of which we sympathize with him all the more. Silver Lining Playbook's humor seemed more dark than quirky in the first half, and when the director David O. Russell brings in the screwball comedy post intermission, I was a tad disappointed because I was looking forward to a better resolution for Pat's dilemma. Maybe Cooper should have performed his character with less believability and more stylization, and then I may have laughed with him all along. But since the actor plays every moment of his character with utmost sincerity and believability, I could not laugh at his actions and behavior before intermission. I pitied him, I prayed for him, I had a lump in my throat when he began screaming at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night, but I did not laugh much.

I was howling with laughter when Tom Ewell played Richard Sherman in Seven Year Itch. I almost fell off my couch watching Billy Wilder and Tony Curtis play two impersonators in Some like It Hot. I fell in love with screwball romantic comedies like Awful Truth and Send Me No Flowers. In none of the films did the protagonists invoke pity right from scene one. Maybe Cooper, despite his impressive efforts, isn't the right choice for a genre like this. His co-star Jennifer Lawrence is ideally cast though because we do not sympathize with her in the beginning; she plays her part in a manner where we gradually fall in love with her eccentricities and then care for her when it seems she won't achieve her desire. This imbalance Cooper creates manifests strongly in the second half when the situation goes berserk – that is when the artificiality sickens us instead of charming us and our interest in the characters and the plot dwindles right up to the very end.

Silver Lining Playbook has a winsome premise involving bi-polar disorder patient Pat's release from mental institution and subsequent endeavor by him to ignore all negativity and set his life back on track keeping the motto 'Excelsior!' in mind. Pat's main objective is to get his wife Nikki back, who refuses to meet him and has a restraining order against him after he almost beat her paramour to death after the two were caught making love in the shower. He is not encouraged by his parents to do so and so when he gets to know that his friend's wife's younger sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) can help him by delivering messages to Nikki, he becomes friends with her. But Tiffany has her own problems – suffering from depression ever since her husband died, she spent a long time having sex with almost all her co-workers (women included) at her job until she was kicked out. Even now, she is extremely impulsive and volatile and she only agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki if he partners her for a dance competition. Pat's father on the other hand suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and he spends his entire time gambling on football team Philadelphia Eagles after losing his job so that he can buy a new restaurant with the money he gets. Things take a surprising turn when Pat Sr., who believes his son is the luck factor for his winning streak, loses his bet money and it coincides with Pat Jr.'s scuffle at the game; Pat Sr. then decides to parlay with his rival where if i) Eagles wins against Dallas and ii) Pat Jr. and Tiffany get a minimum 5 points in their dance competition, then the family shall recover all the money lost on the first bet.

Frankly, the entire football segment with Pat, his elder brother and the American-Indians, and the parlay segment were lame. A big issue I had was the inclusion of Pat's brother in the movie, who served little purpose than to slight his sibling whenever he could and then react to his father's parlay. I was slightly disquieted the moment Tiffany said 'dance with me' but that was nothing compared to the disappointment I felt watching every character break loose and trying to sound as if they really cared about that silly 'parlay'. The part where Tiffany wakes in during the fight and starts reproaching Pat for skipping rehearsals would've suited the old films mentioned in the first paragraph, but doesn't look good in this film. Everything after the parlay scene went downhill, and although it was funny to see the how the events turned up, I was yet dissatisfied by the resolution provided to Cooper's character in the film.

In supporting roles are Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro, Anupam Kher and Chris Tucker. Jackie Weaver speaks more with her eyes and makes it clear that she loves her family to death despite all their oddities. Robert De Niro is perfectly fine except he sounded (only sounded) weirdly like Tommy Wiseau from the disastrous 2003 film The Room at times and that distracted me. Anupam Kher in the role of Pat's therapist Dr. Cliff Patel is alright, but I was stunned when how his character responded to the parlay situation at Pat's home. Chris Tucker is very likable and very funny as the hair-obsessed buddy of Patrick. David O Russell maintains the quick-shifting pace throughout using cuts, zooms and hand-held camera. Yet, on the basis of the impression I got from the first half and the changing impression I got after interval, I was left unconvinced whether Pat had really attained his silver lining.",7
4 January 2013,"One of the best movies of the year, if not the best. If you enjoy movies at all, don't miss out on this one.","The Silver Linings Playbook is one of the warmest, one of the most sincere and the most heartfelt movies I have seen in my lifetime. A wonderful story about broken hearts, how to mend them and how to hold on to life, it will surely leave it's mark on you. The acting is out of this world, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper give what is easily the best performances of their careers. Sometimes the movie becomes an actors' showdown with all the breathtaking talent flying around. And it is, as always, a delight to watch De Niro just be De Niro. I can easily say that it is among the best pictures of the year and is one of the most inspiring movies ever made. If you enjoy movies at all, don't miss out on this one. A must see.

12 June 2013,"Nice movie; Lack ""Wow"" factors","The experience was great, it was fun/ heartwarming/ humorous at time/ and well written and executed. Yet for me it still lacks that ""wow"" factor of many great movies. And at the end by a week or two I cannot quite remember or care about it anymore.

I thought the movie was written really well but it was the actor's performances that really bring out the best out of this movie. The story of a man with mental illness tries to get back his life by trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things change when he met mysterious girl – Tiffany.

I thought Brad performance as a mental patient was really good, much better than I give him credit for all this time. I thought he was even better than Jennifer Lawrence whom also did a remarkable job here (though not really an Oscar worthy). What they both did as for the rest of the cast is what really save this movie from going straight to DVD kind of movie.

Apart from good cast/ great performance and well written lines and story I can't really pinpoint anything else that standout. It was fun to watch the first time, but somehow I don't quite crave for more of it. At the end it is just another good romcom.

Recommendation: Worth rental, see if you will like it because I don't really see anyone will watch it repeatedly.

13 October 2013,overrated...overrated...overrated,"There was so much hype about this movie- it was all about being PC in my opinion and trying to bring light and warm fuzzies to BPD. There were some really great moments, and I think the actress who played the mother was outstanding. Chris Tucker was hilarious and very likable- and Robert D. was just another version of himself as usual but still a good performance. Jennifer Lawrence was nothing special and I am just disgusted that she won an Oscar for thaat? She was fine, but no real stretch or challenge to playing her role- sorry. This awarding of non challenging mediocre performances makes Oscar lose its credit worthiness. Movie was OK- would not pay to see it other than a Netflix.

11 May 2013,Why???,"I was also so excited about seeing this film. I read the book and loved it so I had high expectations for the film. When I watched the film I was so disappointed with the whole thing. What was the point off changing the story? The book was excellent. The dad's not supposed to talk to Pat. The dad's supposed to treat the mum really badly. What about the time problem, where Pat thinks he's been gone for a couple of months though t had been 4 years? That was a huge part of the story just left out! Also Nikki's not supposed to be part of the plan. And why does Danny keep getting out of the ""bad place"" . Also there dance is supposed to be amazing and be against kids without scoring. Etc... why change a great story and make a such a rubbish film. The few stars I gave it are for the acting.

26 January 2013,Wonderfully engrossing and engaging,"David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is the kind of film that dares you to invest yourself in it. It is smart, it is funny, and it is a romantic comedy with some serious issues. It is also categorically one of the most engrossing film experiences in recent memory, littered with fantastic performances and feeling, for every moment of its runtime, real. Russell's script doesn't want anyone in the audience wandering on its periphery; like it or not, everyone is going along for the ride, and no one should be disappointed by the end.

Bradley Cooper stars as Pat, recently released from a mental hospital in Baltimore after eight months, coming home to live with his parents. He is diagnosed bi-polar, and upon his release is convinced that he's going to reunite with his estranged wife Nikki. Cooper is nominated for an Oscar for best actor, and it's easy to see why mere minutes into the film- he lives and breathes this character. Cooper completely disappears into the role, giving Pat's painful struggle with his illness and his attempts to cope with the world a vivid and uncompromising reality. His world is turned upside down, however, when he meets Tiffany (the mesmerizing Jennifer Lawrence), recently widowed and trying to find her own way in the world.

Lawrence is fresh off a Golden Globe win for her part and is also up for an Oscar, an award she may be poised to win on the strength, beauty, anger, and passion she imbues in her character. Already one of the most versatile actresses in this generation, she goes far beyond any of her prior work here. The chemistry between herself and Cooper is also absolutely white-hot, lending a tremendous dose of sexual tension to the entire film. The pain and bitterness beneath both characters is deeply seeded, but these two find one another at the perfect moment, when they most need one another, and every minute of their evolving feelings is deeply felt.

Despite the two fantastic leads, it is Robert DeNiro as Pat Sr. who absolutely steals the film, playing a character so tormented and emotionally realized that even the iconic De Niro is completely unrecognizable inside the character. This is easily his most memorable role in years. Jacki Weaver shines beside him as his wife and Pat's mother Dolores, and both of them are up for best supporting statues at the Oscars.

The brilliant performances are only a shade of why Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best pictures of the year, however. David O. Russell's script and direction take what might have been something far less interesting or engrossing and transforms it into a brutally tragic slice of reality, so beautifully realized in every single shot of the film. Russell puts the camera right in each actor's face, removing any semblance of choice for the audience to emotionally invest itself in these characters- every nuance between them explodes on the screen, allowing each already magnificent performance to transcend great and become truly extraordinary. Using the camera to so invest the audience in the film could have backfired, but with such incredible performances and a top-notch script it comes off brilliantly.

If anything is lacking it is a sense of actual tension in the love story between Cooper and Lawrence, since it becomes obvious early on that it isn't a matter of if they will get together, it is when. The script manages to overcome this somewhat with a story arc about his father betting on football, but the tension that creates is only minor and is equally predictable. Even knowing what is coming doesn't detract from the experience, however, because of how engaging and inviting the film is. This is a family absolutely riddled with problems, but they love one another, and there is a deep-seeded loyalty here that is as apparent as their love of the Philadelphia Eagles.

Little could be done or said that could have made Silver Linings Playbook a better film. It was predictably rom-com-ish in its presentation, despite its off-kilter characters, but this was never a detriment to the film. No matter the genre or the overtold patterns therein, any film that can showcase characters this fully realized is a magnificent one, and this film deserves every accolade being sent its way.

24 February 2013,A solid film,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",7

26 April 2018,Everyone's a little crazy.,"My first glance at The Silver Linings Playbook was during the 2013 Oscars when Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for best actress. The ceremony presented one of the most popular scenes from it, the scene that would compel me to watch it. She asks why Bradley Cooper ordered Raisin Brain, he says because he didn't want it to seem like a date. He says he hopes people don't associate his mental issues with her ""crazy."" She shows him crazy.

Part of me can't help but love this scene. This moment is so raw. Or Real? Perhaps neither. But it is so exhilarating. And many years after having first watched it, I think I may, now, know why.

It must her manic-pixie-dream-girl attitude. The politics of this movie already verge on the conservative but the introduction of a manic-pixie girl would perhaps seal the deal. Does she meet on the requirements of one? Perhaps not, but what are these requirements. I mean she seems manic, having sudden bursts of energy. And she does seems to share the spontaneous attitude Zooey Deschanel sports in 500 Days of Summer (an icon for the manic pixie dream girl trope). She also seems to enliven her lover the way one does. Her dancing seems to bring out new life in Bradley Cooper. It's no wonder my teenage self loved her. She brought out in Bradley Cooper that which a women would someday bring out in angsty-teen me.

My second glance into this movie was when my dad was watching it. After he finished up I asked how it was and he said ""Good."" Isn't it about someone who's crazy or something?"" and he said ""Everyone is a little crazy in this."" I liked that description. It was as if everyone was a little crazy in their own way.

Does this movie romanticize mental disorders? Perhaps. Is that wrong? Probably. But as a person with a mental disorder I liked it. It made me feel like someday I would find someone cute and ""crazy,"" and we could be ""crazy"" together. But my experience is a poor representation for all and I think it's a really a tricky sub genre to enter into, the romance between people with mental disorders. You will doubtless have to walk on thin ice to create a film that people won't find an issue. For how can one make a rom-com in this sub-genre without romanticizing the mental disorder. Isn't that what Romance does?

In any case, whether I like the politics or not, a part of me will always hold part of this film close to me. The acting is good, the script funny, the romance dysfunctioning(until the last few moments of film where Bradley Cooper takes her in his lap and steals a kiss, I'll ignore those moments) and cute. Lovely film.",9
24 February 2017,"Watched it again, loved it again","Wow, it's been 4 years since I viewed it for the first time. But I can't get over the feel-good factor this movie has, the silver lining it has. It's one of the most positive movies to come out in recent years. Maybe bit too unrealistic to be true at moments but who wouldn't wish that.

Bradley Cooper comes in a total new avatar giving a strong and matter-of-fact performance. The authenticity he shows makes him really likable as his character is honest to the point of being rude. About Jennifer Lawrence well I wasn't sure earlier if she should have won Oscar but after this re-watch on a Saturday morning I have become sure as hell. Her performance is magical and funny and honest. Guess humans really like people who are trying to fight to recover from a personal predicament. They give us motivation that each one of us needs daily. Jennifer has played one such character in this movie.

Side characters played by Robert Deniro and Jackie Weaver blend naturally to the canvas of the movie and lends it a family feel. They make you feel a part of the family and show that by being together family being together people can overcome any obstacles.

To me this remains one of the most uplifting movies of all time. Though of course it's bit too sappy and unrealistic at some moments but I think that is required from time to time in our real and dreary lives. As his motto is 'Excelsior' which means 'Ever Upward' we all need to follow it and give a determined fight to whatever obstacle we face.",10
20 December 2012,Silver Linings Playbook (2012),"There is a certain type of manic energy that drives the films of Writer/Director David O. Russell (The Fighter, I Heart Huckabees). His films tend to feature ensembles of flawed but lovable characters struggling to piece their lives together while coping with various familial stresses, chemical dependencies and existential meltdowns. Russell's newest film, Silver Linings Playbook, continues this trend by tackling mental illness with a degree of honesty and warmth rarely seen in Hollywood films.

Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) stars as Pat Solitano, a volatile, bi-polar ticking time bomb prone to violent outbursts, serving 8 months of court-ordered time in a mental hospital for assaulting his wife's lover. Early on we see Pat get released, almost surely before he is ready, and begin to pick up the pieces while living in his parents (Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver) attic. It's clear to the audience that mental illness runs in the Solitano family after meeting Pat's father, an undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive wreck with severe anger management and gambling issues. Driven by delusion and a new optimistic outlook, Pat embarks on a seemingly endless quest to win back the heart of his wife, despite the restraining order she has placed on him.

From the start, Pat is portrayed as a filter less social pariah, instantly alienating (if not terrifying) everyone he comes into contact with. That is until he meets Tiffany, a mysterious, young widow played by Jennifer Lawrence. Like Pat, Tiffany is wild, capricious and damaged to the core. Though their initial meetings go horribly, the two eventually connect and form a shaky, co-dependent alliance. Discovering a loophole in his restraining order, Pat enlists Tiffany to deliver a letter to his wife. She agrees under the condition that he participates in a dance competition as her partner. As they begin to spend more time together, the two grow closer and Pat's behavior becomes less erratic. Cooper is fantastic as Pat, combining his natural comic ability with a dramatic awareness previously unseen in his prior films. Nevertheless, it's Lawrence who ultimately shines brightest. In Tiffany, she has created a complex character bursting with comedic energy, sexiness, intrigue and melancholy.

Perhaps the Russell's greatest achievement is how genuine and natural Silver Linings Playbook feels. Like its characters, the film's tone is skittish and unpredictable, seamlessly blending flashes of uproarious humor with weighty emotional moments that never seem to ring false. While it's certainly not a conventional RomCom, Silver Linings Playbook is unable to fully escape the trappings of the genre. In an instance of uncharacteristic insincerity, there is a bizarre scene in which Russell makes light of the compulsive behavior of one of his characters in order to propel the film towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion. It's a minor blip in an otherwise memorable effort.",7
12 May 2023,"First rate screenplay, direction, acting make it a must watch","When there is a talented director at work on a fine screenplay and he has an ensemble of talented actors and competent technicians at his disposal then the results are normally excellent. This has been proved time and again. This 2012 movie was on my watch list for some time and I am glad that I found time for it. Nominated for 8 Oscars including best picture, director, 4 acting awards, screenplay, and editing ,it however got only one award for Jennifer Lawrence though I felt that they all were deserving. I feel that Bradley Cooper gave a superb interpretation of a complex and multilayered character. Robert De Niro has also given a convincing supporting performance as the football loving and worried father. Its all about stigma, hope, love, marital discord, misunderstanding, family togetherness and mental illness. A number of people may agree with the reluctance of Bradley to take medication because of the unpleasant side effects.

Director David O Russel has done an extremely good job and the storyline development makes the movie engrossing. A noteworthy aspect of the movie is the splendidly interesting narrative where each scene is designed and presented artistically. The dialogue gives strength to the character while helping to make the scenes relatable and gripping. The lines are also quotable. The acting is first rate and all four actors have given award worthy performances. Bradley with his bipolar disorder and Jennifer with her anxiety issues are both excellent. Anupam Kher is convincing as the doctor. An attractive feature is the music and the songs by top vocalists are enjoyable. The climax is about the power of dance to heal matters. Finally it is all about achieving the state of "" Excelsior "" in life as Bradley puts it so well.",8
24 February 2013,Great mix between comedy and drama,"Even though the plot isn't exceptional and even quite banal, Silver Linings Playbook associates perfectly a humour that hits the nail on the head and a more dramatic aspect that, while not revolutionary, is still rather touching.

The characters are absolutely thrilling and each of them adds something to the story. They are brilliantly played by all the actors, Bradley Cooper on top that shows once again his talent and versatility. De Niro is also very good in a smaller role but that suits him very well.

A real sense of proficiency emerges from this movie, whether it is the surgically flowing dialogues, or the excellent direction as often happens with David O. Russell who always gets the best from his cast.

The latter becomes more and more of a sure bet, and proves once again his abilities as a director but also as a writer, a rare particularity deserving respect.",8
9 February 2013,Cooper & Lawrence are mere eye-candy no more in a heartfelt battle against love.,"Silver Linings Playbook is in the enviable position of having been nominated for eight Oscars and it deserves every one of the nods. But that doesn't mean to say it will walk away with any statuettes. Just look back at the 1994 ceremony when The Shawshank Redemption walked away empty handed despite seven nominations. Shawshank was robbed but, unfortunately, Silver Linings Playbook is up against better films in every category. But there is hope; Academy has been known to occasionally get it wrong.

Though there are better films on release, Silver Lining Playbook is a very good film that owes much of its success to the very fine work from the cast, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in particular. Both actors are known predominantly for light, entertaining films rather than gritty performances in films that count and remain in mind long after the event, but this will go a very long way to Hollywood viewing them as serious actors rather than mere eye candy. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably his best performance since Sleepers and almost erases the pain of Meet the Fockers. Almost.

Pat (Cooper) emerges after several months from a mental institution, where he has been treated for bipolar disorder, against the better judgment of the doctors and moves back with his parents (De Niro and Jacki Weaver). He attempts to rebuild his life and win back his estranged wife, despite her restraining order on him. Then Tiffany (Lawrence), a widow with her own substantial emotional issues, crashes into his life and an explosive friendship ensues.

Silver Linings Playbook isn't a traditional love story and there's no guarantee of a sweet beautiful ending, so if you're looking for a predictable, ordinary rom-com you're in the wrong screen. Go and see I Give it a Year and be damned. Here we have two broken people who cause others as much pain as they themselves are struggling to overcome.

For those who have no experience with bipolar disorder, Cooper gives an enlightening performance of a man who knows after the event that he has behaved irrationally, but at the time is incapable of preventing the monster inside from taking control. For those who have, it is a reminder that causes one's head to nod in acknowledgement. But Pat isn't just a disturbed character; Cooper plays him as a man with at odds with what seems obvious to him and the current of understanding that runs beneath the surface.

The performance Lawrence serves up as the angry, destructive Tiffany is like watching Katniss on heroin though a cracked spyglass. Buried deep inside her is a lost soul that needs care and unconditional love but she has developed her own detrimental methods of self-preservation. It is an eye-opening performance and has set a standard for Susanne Bier's Serena, in which Lawrence and Cooper will reunite later this year.

There are no great surprises or shocks with Silver Linings Playbook if you keep your wits about you, but it is a heartwarming film that further cements David O. Russell's status as a writer/director rushing up the A-list. Add it to the 'must see' list at number four or five.

13 November 2020,A warm and witty family drama....,"Mental illness, apart autism, is seldom seen in the movies. And in the aspect the film portrays the mental disorder in normal characters which makes it a treat to satiate the emotion starved audiences. The film gives the warmth of reading a fiction novel at your couch and is further nuanced by the Oscar worthy performances from Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Di Niro, Jacki Weaver, and a short role of Anupam Kher as the psychiatrist.

The beginning is full of surprises with Bradley Cooper out of the mental hospital to his parents' house, after losing his wife, job, and a decent life. The character feels just close to life displaying the moods tantrums, who gets accompanied by Jennifer Lawrence, another character with mental disorders.

At the beginning the film just feels perfect with a raised bar for the surprises. But disappointingly, much is lost in the second half with reduced emotions and ease in the end. Jennifer Lawrence in her role is refreshing, but adjudging to the bar set by Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich,"" it is still not an Oscar worthy performance. Robert De Niro's role too finds not much relevance to gel the drama despite his flawless performance after ""Meet the Parents"". Regarding the story it's purely Brad Cooper's film with his obsession to meet his estranged wife throughout the entire drama till crossed by the aspiration of a mentally disturbed widow. However, concerning a warm and witty family drama, it's still welcome in its genre.

Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6
7 March 2013,Storytelling at its Best,"Director David O. Russel did a new, refreshing and coherent way to tell a rom-com story. From it's gripping but quirky scenes, so fast and fluid, Silver Linings Playbook will glue you to your seat forgetting that it runs for 2 hours, thou, it has hardly nothing but conversations. The film does not showcase good cinematography, effects, musical score, it has nothing fancy but still manages to be charming. The characters portrayed are somehow similar but not identical giving the film a swirl spectrum of dynamics. The film carries a heartfelt story even made better by the performances of actors,Bradley Cooper,Jennifer Lawrence and Robert de Niro, whose skills can carry multi-layered characters. Silver Linings Playbook is an intelligent film, worthy to be watched and awarded.

15 January 2013,"Silver linings is ""GOLDEN""","This movie is getting a whole lot of buzz with nominations from both the Golden Globe and the Oscars. With that powerhouse backing most movie goers will trust that this is indeed a decent movie, and they would be right, except it is more than just decent. Look, I'm not much of a romantic comedy guy, Jennifer Aniston and and Kate Hudson have pretty much ruined that genre for years to come, but then comes along this masterful tidbit. This movie has all the right ingredients to bring romantic comedies back from the dead. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are truly exceptional in their respective roles as is Robert De Niro and for that matter the entire cast. Also the storyline is original and at the same time intriguing, a rare combination in 99% of all romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think it may be one of the best in this genre in the past several years. If you watch movies strictly for the entertainment value, this one will deliver, if you watch for great acting portrayals this one will deliver. Do yourself a favor and see what all the buzz is about.

23 November 2012,Normal is only a setting on the dyer,"Normal is only a setting on the dryer goes the old maxim but as Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) discovers as he reenters his life after a short stint in a mental institution, normal is hard to rediscover. Pat returns to live with his parents Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) until he gets back on his feet. This former teacher and husband so desperately wants to move on with his life. Unfortunately his perception of the world around him can be misleading. In comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has her own set of issues and Pat, Sr.'s obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. Danny (Chris Tucker) is his friend who cheers Pat on as he transitions on the outside. This movie really captures the delicate balance of the complexity of stability when attempting to handle mental illness. After seeing Bradley Cooper play endless bad frat boy characters, this role delves into his skills to portray a multi layer character in a believable role.

7 March 2018,Phenominal Movie With Great Performances,"Silver Linings Playbook is a movie that leaves a mark. Phenomenal writing by David O. Russell along some of the best acting of the year makes this movie such a great time. Every actor gives A+ performances all over the board, headlined by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Both give such real, relatable performances that in turn make every scene a great mix of emotions. There is very little wrong with this movie and deserves great praise. Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best movies of 2012.

20 January 2013,That sweet Silver Line,"Romance just happens. Luck is just chance. And love is crazy. And there's no better way to tell how crazy love is than through this movie. A beautiful movie with quite some nice touch which is really enjoyable. The script is good and so is the direction. But the performances of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence was definitely awesome.

Oh yes, it is also really hilarious. You can enjoy this movie no matter where you are or what mood you are in. It is a sweet movie, filled with passion, hope and craziness in its controlled stage. Do watch this movie to cheer yourself up.

STRENGTHS : - * Screenplay : First half lashes away very fast where as a bit slow at the beginning of the second half... * Performances : by the cast was good especially the Actress was awe- somatic........ * Story and Direction : is simple and predictable one ...

WEAKNESSES : - * Less Romance and bunch of dialogues because this is a drama .. this leads to get a while to relax and get bored sometimes.....

FINAL VERDICT : - * Finally .... the movie was a clean one time watch .... this movie is not recommended to the movie goers who loves adventure and action movies ... this is a drama or looks like watching a play ......

After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro.",7
24 May 2013,"Caution: A good movie, but a way overrated movie!","If you go into this movie thinking that you would like to see a romantic drama with some laughs, a good cast, and a good heart, then you will like this movie. If you go into this movie thinking you are about to see one of the best movies in recent years, then you will be asking yourself ""Really?"" throughout the entire film. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie overall. I just wish my expectations had not been so high. There was very good acting by everyone in the cast, and Jennifer Lawrence is arguably one of the prettiest actresses to come along in decades, but during much of the movie the dialogue just doesn't sound even remotely believable. There was also a contrived fight scene near the end of the movie that I guess was necessary for the plot, but it was entirely 100 percent unbelievable. Still, I would give this movie 3 out of 4 stars for the good acting and the good-natured script. The world needs more positive movies like this one.

The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10
20 February 2013,You will love every moment of watching this film,"I want to advise all, don't make the same mistake I did, I felt this film was just a romantic waste of celluloid and my precious time so I stayed away from it, till I heard about its Oscar nominations. This is one of the best movie I have seen this decade, the acting is so great that I was so surprised; I have seen many Bradley Cooper movies, mind me list some The Midnight Meat Train, Yes Man, He's Just Not That Into You, The Hangover, Valentine's Day, A-Team, Limitless and Hangover II. All of this especially Limitless (2011) shows how good an actor Cooper is, but this movie shows how great an actor he truly is.

Silver Linings Playbook is such a great movie, well written and well directed. The Weinstein Company bought the rights to the book (The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick) before it was even published, a decision I'm sure the company will never regret because not only is this movie a must watch, so you can see wonderful acting from Bradley, Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games (2012) and X-Men: First Class (2011)) and Robert De Niro it is a must have. It is well paced and I liked the score and the dance scenes.

The movie plot is about Pat (Bradley Cooper) who has bipolar disorder, which developed when he found his wife cheating on him and he nearly beat the man to death. The movie kicks off when Pat got released from the mental institution and move back in with his parents. He then met Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just as messed up as he was. The two together developed a relationship that helped keep them mentally stable.

But Pat is still hooked on getting back with his wife Nikki and Pat's father (Robert De Niro) is so determined to get his juju working by bonding with his son so that the Philadelphia Eagles could win, since Pat Sr. is placing all his money on the Eagles winning.

The movie is well directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter (2010)) the screenplay is well crafted to sooth the viewer to feel the intimacy developing between the leads. Silver Linings Playbook was shot on a 33 day period and it got eight Academy Award Nominations including the Big Five the first time since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, (the Big Five are: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and screenplay — either Best Adapted Screenplay or Best Original Screenplay, which has been won by only three movies It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).). Silver Lining Playbook was a commercial box office success making over 7 times its production cost and it is also a critical acclaim.

Here is a movie you have to see no matter what, even if you have to cut corners being down stumbling blocks, just make sure you see this.

13 February 2023,Solid romance with awesome Jennifer Lawrence,"I watched rhe movie with quite some expectations and I did not get dissapointed. The story is solid, characters are interesting and acting is very good, especially rhe performance of oscar winning Jennifer Lawrence. This movie made her famous, I would say, because its her best performance until today.

The movie is also good, but nothing special. A typical romance. I liked the american football references because I am watching the film on the day of the super bowl.

I can recommend you this film if you like Jennifer Lawrence and romances. Bradley Cooper is also great. But do not expect something unique.

25 July 2021,Wonderful film,"Wonderful film

It takes a little while to get started, but this movie is so delightful. The chemistry between the whole cast is amazing! Even the supporting cast really bring truly memorable performances.

As a bonus, this is one of Hollywood's more positive/balanced portrayals of mental illness which is refreshing to see :)

3 March 2020,Meet cute movie about recovery,"Sometimes life hurts. So many times nothing of it makes any sense, and in a bad way. The one's we love cause us pain, appear in a different light - even die. We are left with scars and our unhealthy ways of dealing with them.But as it happens, we thrive on sparks of the extraordinary, and whatever they may be, we are capable of seizing them. At least that's what Silver Linings Playbook has to say about healing. You just gotta be aware of the signs around you, or just anything with a silver lining.

Strong recommendation.

1 June 2018,Silver Linings Playbook,"Silver(Gold) Linings Playbook

Silver Lining Playbook should be called Gold Linings Playbook with the performance that David O. Russell puts up in this movie. Silver Lining Playbook opens up with Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper) after 8 months in a mental hospital, realizing he's been separated from his wife after finding out he's an undiagnosed bipolar and realizes he needs to get his wife back, always keeping with him the idea that if you stay positive and work hard then a silver lining will happen; it just takes him the whole movie to figure out what that silver lining will be. Pat meets Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence) who has just lost her husband and in her mourning also develops a mental illness, which creates a friendship that turns out to help both of them a lot more and in a way they never would've thought before. David O. Russell takes the problem of mental health/illness and shows what it's like to be in their heads, for the people around them, and put into this real issue into a romantic comedy; putting mental health into a movie like a romantic comedy is genius because it shows how normal or regular it is for people to have them. Silver Linings Playbook opens in the mental hospital where Pat is staying and his moms strong drive to take him out which builds a strong sense of pathos between the audience and Pat, and makes them feel sadness and pity for him. In building this Pathos it allows the audience to feel what he's feeling and relate to him more, and always hope for the best for him. Russell chooses 2 incredible actors, Cooper and Lawrence, who are able to take the complexity of these characters to the next level and let us really see what is going on in the heads of these two characters, not just portraying them as crazy and through the eyes of just the surrounding people, but what mental processing is going through their heads when it's happening and what drives them to get there. A big trigger for Pat is hearing his wedding song, because that's the song that he was hearing when he walked in on his wife cheating on him with another worker at the school they worked at. Everytime Pat hears this song it triggers him to go back to that place he was in when he caught his wife with that man, and allows us to see how just one song can affect someone in this state of mind. Though there aren't a ton of movies that put an emphasis on mental health, Silver Linings Playbook does fail to show how people who haven't suffered traumatic events like getting cheated on by your wife, or losing your husband can also suffer from mental health issues like depression, and anxiety. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower includes the aspect that anyone can suffer from mental illness and it doesn't make it any less important that they didn't go through anything traumatic and still happens just as much if not more. This is what Silver Linings Playbook lacks because although it puts a very big importance on this issue and in a realistic approach it lacks to show how common it is like The Perks Of Being A Wallflower does. There has been so many movies done in the last couple of decades that Silver Lining Playbook gives us a breath of fresh air giving us a movie like nothing else made. Russell let's the audience draw their own conclusions about what they think of each character and whether or not Pat and Tiffany are actually crazy or it's actually that other people got them to that place. This movie makes the audience question society and how we treat people and to look at ourselves in the mirror and see the impact we have on one another, rather then bringing people down we need to focus on lifting them up . Silver Lining Playbook is a must see and you will not be disappointed in the performance by these two brilliant actors that make you fall in love and acquire more empathy and understanding for those who deal with mental illness everyday",9
22 September 2013,Worth a punt!...,"I found it a little hard to get into at first with Bradley Cooper over- acting in places, which was beginning to put me off. The introduction of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) though changed all that and the narrative began to make more sense. All the performances were excellent with (for me) Jennifer Lawrence standing out. Yes, I know De Niro is there but he's really not a major character although he does play his part very well. Bradley Cooper was good, but no better really than I have seen him before. The action is littered with an awful lot of music, some I was familiar with and some not so much; all of it fitted the visuals well though and it made for a welcome enhancement to the entertainment. Over all I found it a well rounded romantic comedy (with some drama thrown in for good measure) and just a twist of quirkiness. It even touched me on an emotional level (a rare thing these days) so it gets a pretty high recommendation from me.

SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

My score: 8.3/10.

23 January 2013,Could have been a lot better,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

12 January 2013,Here's one movie that's worth subscribing your medication for,"I think I've officially gone crazy for ""Silver Linings Playbook"", David O. Russell's romantic dramedy about breaking through mentality, gaining your own perspective about life and to also find a brand new start even when it's least expected. Lucky thing about this movie, it is funny and heart-wrenching at times, it's also intelligent about the characters who goes through these real issues at certain moments and there's also some harrowing moments in which our hero and heroine deeply explore themselves and go even further, exposing their own vulnerabilities in the process. Based on the best-selling book by Matthew Quick, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a man suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder who was fired from his job as a high school teacher and spent 8 months in a mental hospital in Baltimore after he beats up the history teacher who was caught having sex in the shower with Pat's (EX)wife, Nikki. He comes back home to Philadelphia in order to get himself fit so he can reunite with her, even though she has a restraining order on him. He has a dad (the great Robert De Niro), an Eagles fan and local sports gambler who is quite forceful on him and a mom (a superior Jacki Weaver) who just wants things to be normal. Along the way, here arrives Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, yes, that Jennifer Lawrence from ""The Hunger Games""), a young girl who also has issues after the loss of her police-officer husband. He spots her when his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) invited him to dinner. Tiffany has already been known as ""the crazy slut with a dead husband"", she likes Pat so much, she even offers to sleep with him. He refuses, stating that he's still faithful to Nikki. So what does these two characters do? He wants to send a letter to Nikki, she wants him as her partner for a dance contest in exchange for that. When the two get to know each other more and more due to the training for the dance contest, their feelings grow stronger for each other. It's kind of a small miracle that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" doesn't fall prey to the romantic comedy playbook, it unexpectedly makes up its own rules. We understand that each of the characters is just like us and it makes room to balance the melodrama, humor and heart of something like this. Now that's something special. What David O. Russell does as a director and a screenwriter is that he knows the characters are not perfect people, but they are real people including Pat's psychiatrist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) and Pat's friend from the mental hospital, Danny (Chris Tucker). What makes the film works and the real reason to see the film is the cast. It's amazing to me that Bradley Cooper, who I liked in movies like ""The Hangover"" films and ""Limitless"", gives without a doubt the best performance of his career. As Pat, Cooper goes all the way developing his happy-joy qualities as well as a dark side. When he breaks down emotionally, you certainly feel his pain of what's he done. Jennifer Lawrence has become one of the best young actresses we've seen in years. Here, she delivers another brilliant and fearless performance and she could possibly get an Oscar for best actress, maybe. She was 21 when this movie was shot, but quickly proves that age is nothing but a number as she plays a woman who may be a floozy, but she likes herself for who she is and she doesn't want people to berate her for that. Robert De Niro definitely gives one of his best performances ever since his Oscar-Winning performance in ""Raging Bull"" as Pat, Sr. He certainly captures the emotion, excitement, and the forceful will of teaching Pat how to live and don't give up, but also keep a look out for the next Eagles game. The rest of the cast, especially Weaver, Tucker and Kher, they have their great moments and God bless them for it. So what if this movie ends like any other romantic comedy? It adds more unexpected surprises that no one would ever witness, even the ending has that in spades. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is truly a movie you won't forget and the silver lining is this: We've gone crazy sometimes. Have you?",9

22 March 2015,Expected more,"I was really excited to watch this film. Why? - The last film I had seen by David O. Russell, The Fighter, was simply amazing, - Bradley en Jennifer are good actors (although I don't adore them like a lot of people do these days), and Lawrence got an Oscar for this - The big amount of awards this film received. - The trailer looked appealing - A lot of friends recommended this film.

But for some reason SLP just didn't really work out for me. The main reasons: I thought it would be more funny and I never really grew to like the main characters. It has absolutely nothing to do with the acting, but I often found myself annoyed by them. I really tried to like it, and kept on thinking that the best part still had to come, but by the end of the film I felt like I had missed something. This is an okay film, but I personally don't understand why this was considered one of the best films of 2012.

11 June 2013,SLP: An Interesting Combination of Qualities,"Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.

SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny; plus, the lead characters are such stereotypes of bipolar-type people. {And in either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake.} As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone--along with the society they create and inhabit--is nuts in a myriad of ways, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.

The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does--it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--e.g., ""Humanity's just NASTY and there's NO silver lining!""--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is hypnotic (and I'll admit, pretty funny).

In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.

*Many obviously disagree with me on how funny this film is--I'm just calling it as I see it.",7
20 April 2022,Very good,"Probably one of the best movies I've seen.

Things I liked:
the cast; great amazing chemistry between Jennifer and Bradley
-the acting due to the cast
the humor; just so everyday not trying tk be anything very natural
the storyline; I expected the ending just In a very different way so kinda surprised me but not at the same time
the dancing; very cute
the mental health issue being discussed
Just a great movie could have diversified the cast a bit more but that's my only issue.

11 January 2016,Lawrence and Cooper nail it.,"David O. Russell's collaboration with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence can be seen as a work of art and a dour mess. Just like Picasso's paintings, Silver Linings Playbook, with no reason behind its title, feels broken but whole at the same time. The on-screen duo, who're mentally unwell for different reasons, juxtapose the convoluted story. They're not the most likable singularly, but put together they're a tour de force. Both are equally outstanding; Cooper's Pat wants to win back his wife and the only way to do that is to help out Lawrence's Tiffany. As they grow closer, they become stronger characters that I'd happily watch over and over again.

6 June 2021,Beautiful film!,"Having known a few bipolar people this film was a very heartwarming to watch. It manages to paint a beautiful picture of how life with this condition maybe. The lows are really bad and how they can affect the people around you, etc. Are very meaningfully and sincerely portrayed by the cast.

Bradley Cooper, J Law are fantastic in their respective roles and Robert De Niro is absolutely delightful to watch. Such a splendid cast backed by a wonderful screenplay, the end result you get is a movie with heart. A movie that moves you.

The film also manages to give you a few laughs and the music is excellent.

I don't know why it took me over 9 years to watch this film lol, but I absolutely loved and was thoroughly entertained by it.

10 March 2013,Unorthodox Romantic Comedy,"Why you shouldn't see it:

I've never been to Philadelphia. I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.

Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly then they're awesome).

You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.

Why you should see it:

I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.

Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing assholes in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's an asshole in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his asshole personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.

You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky go figure).

Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.

In short:

I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.

Exceptions to the recommendation: anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie; anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie; if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies; people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems; anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments; if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love.",8
9 March 2015,Goes for gold,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",
27 January 2013,A must-see film,"This is an inspirational movie about how two broken souls found each other and heal each other by their love for each other. It also sends out a very important message – that there is life after every tragedy, every broken heart. Although I realize in real life, life doesn't always have a happy ending. This is also a film about family, friends, love, compassion, understanding and helping one another. Every characters has their own life problems, while trying to live with their own life/problems and somehow remember to look around and give their support to a friend in need. I especially like the ever-so-patient friend (John Ortiz), of his love and support for his bipolar friend I was never aware of the intensity of the mental pain and anguish suffered by a bipolar until this film. Through this film, I learn more about bipolar, how it affects the life of the patient as well as those around him i.e. the family and friends.

Bradley Cooper gave a very good portray of a bipolar, for once, we could get pass his good look and concentrate on his acting instead. I would like to praise Jennifer Lawrence for her role as a depressed young widow. She is very convincing and has the potential of a great acting talent. I could only imagine how depressing and painful it is to be a widow at such a young age, at of the pain and guilt of losing that someone you love so dearly and so suddenly. Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone, in my opinion, this is one of the must-see film.",8
20 December 2012,"If you're crazy, you must be in love","If you are calling this a 'rom-com' you are misinformed. This is a dark comic look at mental illness, with the possibility of love.

Bradley Cooper is Pat (who has an unspecified anxiety disorder)released from a facility after almost beating to death the man who was having an affair with his wife Nikki. He's lost his job, his home and is living with his parents. Dad (Robert De Niro)has trouble with anxiety as well. It seems almost everyone in this movie suffers some sort of disorder. Pat is convinced he can win back his wife if he can make his life manageable. His friend's wife sets him up with her sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a widow also suffering. She says she will deliver a letter to Pat's wife Nikki (Pat can have no contact because of a restraining order), if Pat will dance with her in an upcoming competition. Pat believes his compassion for Tiffany and commitment to the competition will prove to Nikki he's ready for her to take him back.

Bradly Cooper if fantastic. He conveys all the anxiety, confusion, mania and anger you might expect from someone a little out of step with everyone else. There is no wink, no subtle nod that 'I'm not really crazy, this is a game'. This is a very true performance. Robert De Niro is compelling as well in his belief that his son is somehow controlling the destiny of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. Jennifer Lawrence also does very good job.

The Silver Linings Playbook says you can have a great fulfilling life with mental illness... but you need a strategy... Excelsior! Trivia note: If you look quickly at the theater marquee you'll see the movie showing on Halloween is 'Midnight Meat Train'.",9
17 January 2022,When is a rom com not a romcom?,"Absolutely brilliant.

BC & JL are great ... and DeNero is also fantastic. In a comedy!

This is a brilliant departure from run-of-the-mill romcoms. A genuinely interesting story with no - well, hardly any - sap and smaltz. Very refreshing and very funny.

16 December 2012,Possible the best understated film I've ever seen.,"Ran out of big films to watch and was so bored, decided to see this out of desperation and nothing left except kiddies cartoons. thought ""here we go, another to Arty Farty depressing film, this time about depression"" WOW, this film blew me away! so funny, so quirky, so real, so well acted. Do you ever get sick of car chases, violence or CGI? Well this film actually has ACTORS! It actually has characters! It has a: story, emotion and great sound. Romance, irony wit... I can go on and on and on. Skyfall made millions, lord of the rings and Harry Potter too. But none of them came close to making me smile like this film. Do your self a favor, watch it! XXXXX

8 May 2019,"Pretty okay Drama, Romance, (Comedy) with mental illness as a main topic","Feels like the most standard movie. Good acting and production, decent screenplay. Some dialogues are the typical blah-blah, others are better and even a bit emotionally touching. Plot has some good moments.

If I'd had to place it between two movies in terms of rating, I'd put it above 'Carnage' with Christoph Waltz and slightly below 'La La Land' with Emma Stone, even if the genres are a bit different. Some people might even like it more than 'La La Land'. I don't know.

I don't feel bad I watched 'Silver Linings Playbook', I liked it for most parts.

2 February 2013,'Silver Linings Playbook' is simply an entertaining film and one of the best of 2012,"I had wanted to see this film for a while, especially after the Oscar nominations came in and this film was surprisingly nominated for 8 Oscars including 'Best Picture' Now that I've seen this movie, I can happily say that this movie is deserving a spot of the Best Picture nomination 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a story about a guy and a girl who both have had such a hard life of their own. Patty is trying to reconcile with his former lover when he meets the eccentric Tiffany, who also has had a tough life behind her.

This film is not what I expected going into it. I just expected a funny romance movie but what I got was something that very well depicts what life can be like. The film was definitely funny, entertaining but most importantly it shows how depressing life can be. The film, nor the director David O Russel allowed the script to ever fall away from the movie. The jokes weren't over the top, they were pretty simple funny moments but this film knows that it wasn't to be a crazy comedy. The tone of the movie is sad, a little humorous and well sad! The writing never takes away from the tone. The direction and writing is great. Good job! The acting in the movie is easily its biggest strength for me. I loved the performances in the movie, especially the ever so brilliant Robert de Niro who is definitely by far the best. That isn't to say the supporting cast wasn't good, they were terrific. Jennifer Lawrence brought such a realistic portrayal to her character Tiffany as did Bradley Cooper. By the end, these are characters we cared about. I was actually so glad to see Chris Tucker back for a short part of the film. Its been 5 years since we've seen him in a film and I'm glad he's back! The story in the movie is definitely great but also to me, its only real weakness of any real sort. Its hard to find any real weakness with the movie as everything is done brilliantly but if anything has to be called its weakest thing, its perhaps the story. The real story to the film doesn't begin until over one hour in but it was no issue as the characters were fleshed out.

The characters in the movie were great especially de Niro's character the father. I loved all these characters by the end of the film that I believe this film was certainly worth a 2 hour watch, despite most movies like this being a half hour shorter.

In conclusion, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a movie that is most definitely worth a watch and perhaps ""even"" deserving of a Best Picture nominations despite movies like the Dark Knight Rises, Avengers and the Hobbit coming out in the same year.",9

2 February 2014,Can easily be the best movie ever.,"*Listening to Jessie J's Silver Linings (Crazy 'bout You) while writing this.

My favorite Drama/Romance movie ever is The Holiday (Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black) and then I watched this movie.

I love it. Brought tears to my eyes. Rarely do movies to that to me. The plot is amazing. The story was written brilliantly. I can actually go on praising this movie forever. And yes, this could easily replace The Holiday as my favorite movie ever but then again two is better than one.

A must watch. For those who are into movies that move you Silver Linings Playbook will definitely do that to you. Just watch the movie. :)

6 August 2022,Find yourself in the process ...,"After he got out of a mental institution , Pat moves back with his parents and trying to reconcile with his ex-wife .

That was exactly what I needed , a light funny romantic story that's dramatically strong .

Lately ,I have found the ordinary love stories ,the perfect ones cringe if it's the right thing to say, and this one was very unique .

It's a rare kind of movies ,it's fun to watch and it's perfectly balanced , it discusses some interesting topics ,especially how society and close friends or family members can see and treat mentally ill people .

Pat being a mentally ill person ,a cute innocent one ,the craziest Tiffany and the charismatic caring father patrizio.

Three Oscar performances ,of course they are and at least the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence won.

The cast was enough for me to have interest , Deniro's performance was great ,the same goes for Bradley ,he's one my favorites and he just never miss .but the craziest performance was from Jennifer playing the craziest character .

Sometimes you can find what you're seeking for in the process .I should say no more .",8
23 March 2013,Best Rom-com in years,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" avoids all the rom-com pitfalls and clichés--a breath of fresh air to a stigmatized genre I typically avoid like the plague. It is an unconventional, quirky, amusing comedy drama about troubled people looking for love, and one the best romantic comedies in recent memory.

After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents, and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife (Brea Bee), who has a restraining order against him. Pat is curiously confident and upbeat despite this because he's determined to repair the damage he's done to his life and surprises everyone by moving onward and upward. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.

The phenomenal performances by Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert DeNiro are what make this film work so well. In addition, terrific supporting roles by Chris Tucker, who works his motor mouth with some of the best lines in the film, while Jacki Weaver as Pat's mom does a fine job as well. David O Russell's screenplay is fantastic in the way it requires both father and son to face and deal with their mental problems together, through the Philadelphia Eagles, and a dance contest nonetheless. Addressing serious life issues with grit and emotion, injected with a potent dose of humor throughout. The writing is sharp, witty, and insightful with great character development. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is ultimately a beautiful film about being comfortable with oneself, and approaching life with a sense of optimism despite shortcomings and setbacks.",8
25 February 2013,Deliciously funny script despite being a predictable romance,"Silver Linings Playbook, adapted from a novel of the same name by Mathew Quick drew acclaim and 8 Academy Award nominations. it is also the first film in 31 years to be nominated in all four acting categories. While all the performances were top-notch, Jennifer Lawrence won the Best Actress Oscar. All this is alluring enough to make a movie buff watch the film. And it turns out to be totally worthwhile.

Pat/ Patrizio Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released into the care of his parents after having spent a while at a mental health institution. Although under treatment for Bipolar Disorder, he detests pills and has a hard time dealing with the fact that his wife Nikki has now moved on after an episode when Pat beat up her paramour in fit of rage and he faces a restraining order from her and the school where he used to work.

Ronnie, a friend of Pat's invites him over to his place for dinner, where he meets his sister-in-law Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and has her own share of psychological issues which manifests in the fact that the whole town seems to know for her freewheeling promiscuity. Oddly though, both hit of well over a conversation about the medication they have been on and bond well thereafter.

The best written parts in the story are the conversations between Pat and Tiffany, in what can be described as 'no holds barred'. There's a time when Pat says ""I don't have a filter when I talk"", which essentially describes their condition and bonding over the fact that they don't have to pretend with one another, unlike the rest of the society.

And among the most hilarious instances is when Tiffany chases Pat, he tells her ""I'm married"" to which she says ""So am I"", Pat: ""But, your husband is dead"", Tiffany: ""where's your wife?"", Pat: ""You're crazy?"" Tiffany ""I'm not the one who just got out of that hospital in Baltimore""

The other characters, Pat's parents Patrizio Sr (Robert De Niro) who is probably as 'differently wired' as his son, Pat's mother (Jacki Weaver), his humorous friend from the Baltimore institution Danny (Chris Tucker) and therapist Dr Patel (Anupam Kher) also manage to leave their mark as the film allows these characters to take lives of their own without getting into unnecessary details or sub-plots.

Strong script, Yes! But the film also draws its strength from powerful performances. Bradley cooper is very convincing as the man on recovery mode, taking to fitness. Tiffany as the girl who found a socially unacceptable way to deal with her loss, De Niro as the gambling addict and Anupam Kher, a serious therapist who turns out to be a crazy Eagles fan. Chris Tucker is a great addition to the film despite the small role.

Well, what does the title actually refer to? The silver lining is driven by the strong belief that Pat has in happy endings. His feelings are evident in an animated conversation that Pat has with his parents in the wee hours debating on why in one of Hemingway's books does the story has to end with somebody's death. He is driven by the principle 'Excelsior', the Latin word for 'ever upwards' which he keenly lives by.

Some pitfalls in the movie could be that the romance in the story is very predictable and that may not have ended in any other way. Generally, that is true for most romances that thrive on culminating in happy endings. Another is question on whether or not this role of Bradley Cooper is an accurate portrayal of Bipolar Disorder or not. And then the obsession of De Niro's character on betting all his money over superstition.

The verdict: The Oscar nominated movie 'Silver Linings Playbook' is definitely worth a watch for the skillful writing and humor brought out in the oddest of circumstances. While the movie is careful enough not to poke fun of any mental condition, those that have reservations about its portrayal on screen, could better stay away.",8

13 January 2013,I was compelled to write a review on how good this movie was!,"I went to see this movie because of how many nominations it has garnered for the past month and also my one and only Ms. Jennifer Lawrence is in it. I loved it... I don't get when people say they were bored or the story was weird. It's supposed to be weird (They're crazy!!!) At first, I was skeptical with the Bradley Cooper and J Lawrence pair up but damn they fit quite well together. This is one of those movies that tell you how life gets so crazy you just gotta live with it. Acting was nothing under amazing! No one was out of place everyone did their job whether it be to provide comical relief or to add drama to the screen they all did wonderfully.

This movie is ALSO NOT ONLY FOR GIRLS! I put it in Caps since most guys will probably think this movie (looking at its poster) is positioned towards women but no it is not. You'll enjoy it nonetheless.

Kudos for a wonderful movie from 2012! And Congrats to all the nominations and wins this movie has gotten so far!",9
11 January 2013,"Fly, Eagles Fly!","I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan. One of the few in Canada, because most NFL fans here are Patriots, Bills and Packers fans. Why am I talking about the Eagles? Well they are actually a large plot point of the film. I'll get to that in a bit.

Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man discharged from a mental institution as he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He is trying to patch things up with his family and his wife while focusing his aggression into something constructive. Cooper was excellent for the part and I think it has something to do with this film being centred in his hometown. When I think of Philadelphia, two actors come to mind: Will Smith and him. Too bad he didn't do the accent, would've loved the have heard 'dat Philly tawk yah mean?'. And he can dance, that's nice. I heard Mark Wahlberg was in talks for this role... yeah... dodged a bullet there.

Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany, a fellow nutcase who helps Pat find focus by involving him in her dance project. She was very good in her performance. It just keeps bugging me that she's my age. She is already and accomplished actress while I still have no clue whether or not to apply for grad school. Damn.

Robert De Niro, I love seeing him back. He plays Pat's dad, a very superstitious Eagles fan. See. He also bets on Eagles and Phillies games. This role is slightly different but still De Niro. Since he is from New York it was nice seeing him as a South Philly dad.

And it was great seeing Chris Tucker again especially in such a downplayed role. As a comedian I never thought he was funny, he was always just shrieking in his whiny register, here I actually liked him. And also the Indian guy who plays Pat's therapist, man the onslaught of Indian actors in American films continues.

I guess I liked this film a lot because it was directed by the director of Three Kings, which is actually one of my favourite films. Also this film wasn't over-dramatic it had the right balance of emotions.

Going back to the Eagles. I could tell from the beginning line that this film took place in 2008 because they were referencing DeSean Jackson dropping the ball at the 1 yard line. That was a surprisingly good season, since they went to the NFC title game for the 5th time but they lost. I hate Larry Fitzgerald for that. Because of this film I really miss Donovan McNabb as quarterback and Andy Reid. Hopefully Michael Vick and Jason Peters can recover and give us the ring we badly deserve.

Finally in all the bits involving the Birds, why couldn't they get Merrill Reese to do some voice overs?",10

It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",2
6 October 2016,A Movie Anyone Can Relate Too and Enjoy,"In Life We've all had are ups and our downs, been in crazy relationships and had parts of ourselves that nobody else can truly understand and all of this is addressed in David O Russel's, Silver Linings Playbook. This movie perfectly balances Drama and Comedy to create for both a heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that every one can relate too. The performances in this movie are mind blowing with Bradley Cooper really surprising me with his lovable portrayal of a man who struggles with his conditions but you're able to get behind him because Cooper always portrays him as a good person at heart. Jennifer Lawrence one an Oscar for her performance and it's well deserved it showed that a she could to more than be Mystique or Katniss Everdeen she has absolutely Amazing Chemistry with Bradley Cooper and you truly feel their connection together. Robert De Niro does some of his best work here as Coopers father trying desperately to hold his home and family together with De Niro showing Vulnerability and Emotion that we've rarely seen from him. Behind all these great performances is a great director and David O Russel is proving to me more and more that he is one of the best directors working today he doesn't get in the way of these amazing performances he holds back and let's you see them. Every character in this move has something that makes them a human being and relatable making you care more about them towards the film climax. The main plot point of the movie is the romance between Cooper and Lawrence and you care so much about them getting together you just feeling every time they have a scene with just the two of them. I have but one flaw one this movie and it is the sub-plot between Cooper and his ex wife there's never really any scene where you get the chance to see them together as a couple and see what Coopers character is missing so much with her. Overall Silver Linings Playbook was one of the greatest movies of 2012 and is virtually universally Beloved if you want to watch a relatable film about life and relationships then watch this film right now. 94%-A",9
29 December 2014,Exceptional acting.,"The plot is quite plain and maybe looks boring, when you hear about it from someone, but oh, Jennifer Lawrence's acting was insanely good, i mean Bradley Cooper was awesome too, but Jennifer was just amazing, i can see why she got all the awards for this movie. Has got to be one of the best characters i have ever seen in a movie.

Doesn't matter if the story in this movie seemed kind of boring and not appealing to some people, i loved the movie, because of the great actors and their performances.

I loved the idea how Pat and Tiffany were both going through similar problems, what i loved about it the most was their strange conversations and their mood swings. Of course, it was blatant that Tiffany fell in love with Pat right off the bat, Pat's emotions were just funny and entertaining, when he was with Tiffany.

3 February 2013,An inspiring movie - ripe for an Oscar,"I am not much into drama or romance movies, but once in a period I watch one, and I have to say that I really enjoyed and was very moved by Silver Linings Playbook. It's not one of these classic romances where You wait, from the beginning of the movie to the very bitter end, for the main characters to develop a love story and that's it. It's different and it excites the viewer until the very end. I was expecting a total different plot, and was delighted by watching it, because it wasn't at all predictable like it usually is in that kind of movies. The characters are developing their relations very realistic. The moods of Pat's (Bradley Cooper) bipolar disorder give You an insight of a mental disorder and You never know how he will behave in the next scene. But after all, he is smart and develops a strategy by having always a positive attitude, so the dramatic scenes are never depressing, but tense. By the first half of the movie I was so much into the main character, that I realized what Bradley Cooper was really capable of. In his previous movies he had absolutely different roles, like the confident, macho leader in ""Hangover"" opposing to this role, where he is a soft, but moody teacher, who is afraid of his emotions. He is indeed an recognized actor that deserves the Oscar. De Niro's acting was very impressive. He had always a serious and caring attitude as Pat's father, but due to his sarcasm in severe situations, as well as his football fanaticism, he always brought me to laugh. Jennifer Lawrence had a nice performance. With this movie she proved that she is capable of acting in more serious roles. I don't think that they could find better actors for this movie. It's worth to watch!",9
12 December 2013,Amazing Performances make up for the shortcomings of the story,"If you're looking for a movie that is both hilarious with a meaning, you've come to the right place. This film, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, centers around two bipolar friends, Tiffany Maxwell and Pat Solitano. Pat is desperate to get back with his estranged wife, Nikki, where Tiffany is widowed after her husband was killed in a traffic accident. They come to a deal where if Pat will join Tiffany in a dance competition, Tiffany will deliver Pat's letters to Nikki.

The movie is superbly acted, which gained Jennifer Lawrence an Oscar win at the age of 22, plus a nomination for Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro. The film itself received several other Oscar nominations.

What is great about Silver Linings is that it accurately portrays mental illness without offensive exaggerations that are far too frequent in other programs. The humor and drama are both well balanced.

My only problem with this movie is that I craved more from the plot. It seemed that there should have been more to the story than practicing for a dance competition and winning a bet. However, this issue is easily overlookable, as the actors give a flawless performance.",8
20 May 2013,"clever, manipulative, formulaic","The characters in this film barely had time to develop before the plot ruthlessly buried them in an avalanche of predictability. I was suspicious because of the title and in fact, its clever summation perfectly described what was to come: how football and dancing and romance and family are what life is all about. Blech. This was a romantic comedy with mental illness but both the leads were gorgeous and full of hidden talents.

I saw this at the cheap theater and my friend and I discussed leaving three quarters of the way through, but we decided to stay because we were minimally curious about how it would turn out. The story was good but maddeningly predictable, and clearly careering towards huge amounts of syrupy happiness...but they kept taking pointless twists and turns to get there. The acting was fantastic: the lead played a bipolar man exceptionally well, especially considering his good looks - he was able to come across as sweet, troubled, infuriating and vulnerable. The female lead also gave a spectacular performance but again, she was supposed to be mentally ill and yet was composed, poised and displayed great insight in several scenes - effectively undermining the character's integrity and credibility. The dad (another great piece of acting by Robert DeNiro) seemed to vacillate between unrealistic/angry & wise and supportive....but of course despite all their considerable problems, everything works out wonderfully in the end and there is a big cast of kooky but lovable friends and family who show up in the final scenes. This movie worked hard to be something special but it's formulaic underbelly kept interrupting the flow and believability of the characters' actions (and therefore the story itself). I do wonder about the book, however, because the character development had a few flashes of brilliance (although this may have had less to do with the writing and more to do with the fine acting). I got the impression the movie left a lot out...there were a couple of minor characters who showed up but then were forgotten. Maybe it was bad editing but it smelled a lot like some Hollywood committee hijacked the writing or directing. Either way, someone sold out.",5

12 August 2023,It's truly a gem,"Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence truly shine in this film. Cooper brings vulnerability and charm to Pat, depicting the struggles of mental illness and the pursuit of a positive outlook on life. Meanwhile, Lawrence's Tiffany is a compelling mix of inner turmoil and a straightforward attitude.

Their on-screen connection is so real, adding depth and authenticity to the movie's emotional heart.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" approaches the topic of mental health with genuine care and realism. It explores the challenges that people dealing with mental disorders go through, shedding light on how these conditions affect their connections, confidence, and everyday existence. The characters' experiences underline the significance of empathy, comprehension, and embracing oneself.

22 June 2023,There is a silver lining,"Don't know how or why I missed seeing this movie in 2012. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper shine in this well written script. This movie does a brilliant job at creating humor and drama. After spending eight months in a psychiatric hospital for beating his wife's lover, and discovering he is bipolar, Pat (Bradley Cooper) is released into the care of his parents. Pat still hopes he can be reunited with his wife. But he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who became promiscuous after her husband's death. Both are equally damaged. But you find yourself rooting for them to be together. This movie deals with mental illness, family dysfunction and life in general, and all the pieces fit together perfectly. It makes you laugh and cry. I admit that I cried at the ending. The supporting cast is terrific. Robert De Niro, Pat's father, gives a stellar performance as always. Jacki Weaver, Pat's mom, is excellent as the only sane person in the room. Good movie.

30 December 2012,Silver Lining Playbook: Recipes for Success,"I won't beat around the bush and I will get right to the point. This movie is probably the best movie of the year by far. Every single actor in this movie played their parts perfectly and I couldn't ask for a better cast. Every performance blew me away. The directing and writing done by David O. Russell is great. I found absolutely nothing wrong with this. Well, there was this one thing. It made me nearly bite off my thumb nails in suspense near the end. Actually that's not really a bad thing, but whatever. I strongly recommend seeing this film. If you are torn between this film and Les Miserables, look at what you want to see in a movie today. Do you want to be involved in a journey through France and the craziness of that great musical or would you rather stay right here in America. You'll laugh. You'll cry. Most of all, you will find a deeper understanding in your own life. Think about it.

2 October 2013,Brilliant,"To date this has to be Bradley Coopers finest work, it just goes to show he can act given a fine script such as this. Silver linings play book is a clever movie where by the camera work is both focused and random all of which appears to be deliberate. The dialogue and script as well is also somewhat random in parts, but this too I felt was deliberate as we are watching a movie about people who have issues on differing levels and it shows that nobody is without their quirks and it gives the sense that you are also in that world to. As the trick here is that is only slightly hinted at what the full gravity of why Pat(Bradley) was in an institution.

I don't normally do ""Romance"" but this movie is an exceptional example on how not to do just slush but have a well crafted movie on top. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are perfectly cast and steal the screen and Robert De Niro's performance is also brilliant and not his usual hard man role.

12 January 2013,Wow - best film of the year - very emotional,I have to agree with a number of the comments on this film - meggz3 put it exactly as I wanted to write it and I probably wouldn't do a better job of it as she or he has- I have to say I was blown away the acting was brilliant throughout by a sterling cast. Robert De Nero playing the OCD father deserves a best supporting actor and Jennifer Lawrence just gets better in every film and of course Bradley Cooper is just great - So many films will get the tip and the wink for the Oscar above this but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to be right up there with them. The superlatives for this film will still be going on about this gem of a movie well after the Oscars and I for one will be seeing it again because I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence too! I don't want to say too much as I don't want to be blacklisted- but to play a role that is as difficult as somebody who has mental illness issues and to be as convincing is something else- but when two people do (an actor and actress) it is mind blowing - For me it is the best film of the year and I have seen most of the films that are in contention for Oscars- what they deliver in the most part is special effects or a history lesson or simply good old fashioned violence. But this film delivers comedy and romance in equal measures that leave you elated at the end and that is exactly how you want to leave a cinema experience I would be even more elated if this gem got best picture but I can dream,9
20 January 2013,A beautiful small film that delights with splendid performances.,"After watching this film, you will be emotionally attached. It is in my opinion a drama comedy rather than a Rom-com. The story is well told and the performances from the four main characters excellent.

Bradley Cooper at the beginning of the Oscar Season buzz was only rated as a short chance of a nomination. Well, I actually thought his work was well measured and his performance was strong. Jennifer Lawrence and De Niro were well deserved nominees too. But, in my opinion Jacki Weaver was a pleasure to watch as the mother of Brad's character. An understated performance who also deserved her nomination.

Regardless if the film only managers to achieve a few Oscars. It was pleasant piece of work. Well directed and even Chris Rock had to act and not rely on comedy. The story was pleasing and showed the real nature of Bi-Polar disorder in a well informed manner and David O Russell has worked hard again. An excellent piece of work.",9
8 August 2013,Better than I expected,"Normally I do not specifically like this type of movie, but I have to say i'm glad I decided to watch it because it was a really exciting film. The story touched me and I completely forgot about my surroundings. I felt a certain tension and it held on until the very end.I also was very impressed with the acting of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I knew Bradley Cooper from Limitless and I had to adapt to the role he played here, but after a short while I was fully adapted. Jennifer Lawrence was also a familiar face. I met her in the Hunger Games. At first I missed Katniss a little bit, but it turned out there was an awesome character replacing her: Tiffany.

22 February 2014,I wanted to like t more,"Quite a jumbled up mixed bag of a movie here. Jennifer Lawrence won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this? That was not an Oscar winning performance. She was great at times, with a monologue or two that I can see helped seal the win, but Jessica Chastain was WAY better in Zero Dark Thirty. Overall, Ms. Lawrence was just very good but not exceptional. Bobby De Niro was great, I sure hope he was runner-up for Best Supporting Actor (if they have such a thing with the voters behind the scenes.) Bradley Cooper definitely deserved his nomination for Best Actor. So well done. But the movie lost me at the dancing and then seemed to take a whole different direction with the football. I've got nothing against either but they just didn't jive with the first half of the story. Because I am a man, I am not supposed to especially like romance stories but this one here works and I liked it a lot. Obvious, yes, but I probably like it because it was kind of discreet and sneaks up on the viewer rather than being so stupidly and grossly in your face the whole time. The story has much more to it than that. For some reason I wanted to like this more, and I still give it a fairly high grade, but a Best Picture nomination? If the Academy never idiotically expanded the field to 9 films, I sure hope this would not have made the cut.

9 April 2013,Silver Lining Golden Message,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10
5 May 2019,Best movie ever,"Even think it's a lot of time since I first time saw this movie it's still my favorite for years. And I can't understand those bad reviews. This movie is positive, crazy and funny. It's easy to watch and you can find a hidden message in it. I rewatched it so many times that I can't count and still want to watch it again. Love Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence together, they had perfect chemistry. Probably you have to be at least a bit crazy by yourself to really understand this movie.

12 August 2013,Solid.,"To some degree, relating to the situations and conditions of the main characters in Silver Linings Playbook may increase your overall enjoyment of the film. This is a heading that anyone should acknowledge before pressing play.

With that out of the way, what this film is, at its heart, is a romantic comedy that does certain things well and others poorly. The on-screen chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, whose relationship is a focal point of the film, is jagged at best; and this is to the film's benefit, as you watch their interactions unfold. The father-son relationship between Cooper and Robert DeNiro is almost completely unbelievable, and if this film has any sour sticking point, this is it. DeNiro's casting seems almost purely for name power, as if the filmmakers weren't confident enough in Cooper And Lawrence being attractive draws (which they undoubtedly are, Cooper perhaps more so now than DeNiro has been in years).

With the volatile relationship between Cooper and Lawrence, a great many of situations develop, some predictable, some not, but they all are arranged and constructed appropriately to tell a tale of adversity, perseverance, and the crazy moments in between. At times it feels forced, at others confused, but for many American families, this is life. I can relate, and I refer back to my opening paragraph as a reminder that so much of this film can either hit you in the heart or fly over your head depending on who you are. This is true of most art, but Silver Linings Playbook is a bit more focused, almost but not quite a ""niche"" film.

Overall, a great film, but anything resembling universal appeal is lost due to the subject matter and some unwarranted casting choices. But for those of us who can relate, to some degree, I do believe you'll feel the same as me; well worth the 2 hours.

P.S. - I've noticed more than a few reviews of this film that claim the movie doesn't accurately portray mental illness, and that it makes light of a serious issue. You cannot, in any way, blame the film for this; it is a story, to be enjoyed or not, not a documentary on the mental disorders of the main characters. Keep that in mind.",8
20 November 2012,What romantic comedies SHOULD strive to be like. An adaptation that beats its source material!,"Silver Linings Playbook is what all book adaptations should aspire to be like. Take a book that was good and turning it into a classic film. In the same vein as The Devil Wears Prada, Silver Linings Playbook outdoes its novel and creates a wonderful story and movie. The movie is close to the book to please fans but diverges enough to give you a fresh take and entertaining film. Even though I read the book, the movie kept me guessing and intrigued the entire time. The film wins with wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper, Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. A standout performance was given by Jennifer Lawrence, who reminds us why she was nominated for an Oscar before the Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence shows why the movie was rewritten to add her despite her age. The chemistry between the leads is impeccable. THIS is what romantic comedies should aspire to be. Real enough to deal with issues with a dramatic flair, but never forgetting their comedic undertones to provide the feel good feeling. I'm excited to see where this movie lands on award seasons.",9

22 February 2013,"If you read the signs, there are always silver linings","It was such a pleasure watching this movie which is way better than I expected. I laughed, I cried and I am inspired. Leaving the cinema, I felt great, warm, and blessed.

What a good script with great acting and uplifting messages! Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are simply adorable – how can you be funny, troubled and yet loving at the same time? But they did it - with the help of a very strong supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence is young but promising, also very convincing to play someone with problems!

Even though Pat (Cooper) has bipolar disorder and needs medication, we can't help feeling empathized with him despite the fact that almost all characters in the movie are crazier than he is! This is so ironic and close to real life. But then it was OK if we are a little stressed out at times, as long as we have a strong supportive network and ways to release pressure. For Pat, it was running, reading and working at getting back with his ex-wife whom he is obsessed with and becomes his drive. For Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), it was dancing (and more?). For Dad (Robert De Niro), it was watching the Eagles and mending the relationship with his son.

The sincere and yet hard-to-express father-son relationship was beautifully portrayed. Ditto the caring between friends and families. Yes, there maybe little lies here and there and not telling everyone everything. So what? Be forgiving! Don't sweat the small stuff! In the end, we learned that whatever we say may not matter if you have good intentions. Step back and look at the large scheme of things: watch the actions, read the signs, do your research, and be positive. You will see the silver lining and get what you want when you work hard at it.

What a feel good movie. It will brighten up your day after you dry your tears and laugh your lungs out. Go see it.",8
15 March 2013,Din Not Expect This,"He goes from a terrible hangover twice, to being a freak out of jail, to a bipolar man fighting for the love of his wife, way to go Bradley Cooper. Silver Linings Playbook is an Oscar nominated film for best picture for many things. Bradley Cooper for best actor, Robert DeNiro for best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best director, Jennifer Lawrence won for best Actress, and it was also nominated for best picture. This film deserved most of its nominations, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved her Oscar win. Silver Linings Playbook was not something I expected to be good, good thing I was wrong.

I didn't think Bradley Cooper could do this well in a lead role. His performance blew me away. His mood swings, his charisma, and his charm gave him an Oscar nomination. He went from a drinking problem to a mood disorder. He caught his wife cheating on him and he lost it. With a combination of that and his wedding song playing at the time, he beat him within an inch of his life. He was then rehabilitated in a medical facility for mood disorders and the movie kicks off with his release. In the very opening scene with his mother we see the comedic charm he brings to the movie. He helps his friend escape and they play it off like he was released as well and just needed a ride. This is a gag they play throughout the movie and the character himself is a nice touch to the movie. From the first scene to the last Cooper gives it his all. My favorite scene is when it is late at night and he is reading A Farewell to Arms and he is angered by the ending. He goes ballistic and throws the book through the window, waking up the whole neighborhood. We see him go from happy to angry to sad to sorry and it was a really well acted scene. He goes nuts, his father panics, the mother cries, and it ends with a touching moment. We also see conflict between him and his father. Robert DeNiro plays the father who has obsessions with football rituals. He is much like his son and DeNiro did do a really good job in the role but I don't think he deserved an Oscar nomination. I expected a little more from his character and I was a little disappointed. He likes to have his son there watching the game, he has three remotes a certain was, all because he believes it will help the Eagles win the game. It is little moments like these that drive the movie forward and lead to the rest of the film. Then we meet Tiffany. Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany and right when you see her on screen everybody knows that the story will instantly turn to the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. It did, it was a little cheesy, but it worked. Cooper and Lawrence had this natural chemistry and you could tell they liked being together and acting together. They have similar problems and similar personalities and they bounce off each other in the most entertaining way possible. At first they don't like each other. Another scene was when they are in the diner and they are both taking shots at each other and Tiffany goes nuts. It is scenes like that which got her the Oscar nomination, and she well deserved the win. Overall, Silver Linings Playbook really had it all, humor, romance, touching moments, and scenes I could watch again and again. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, and that is never a bad thing. With strong acting led by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, funny humor, a strong supporting cast, and a fantastic script Silver Linings was one of the best films of 2012 and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. It is a movie you don't judge by the cover and really need to get into. If you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, watch it with them because it is a good movie for couples. Watch it again and again and appreciate how Bradley Cooper made this transition from comedy to a film that was mainly drama. Look past the cheesy moments and the easily predictable ending and just embrace the magic of film.",9
2 February 2022,amirhoseinahg,"Let me say at the outset that ""The Book of Hope"" is not a good quality film, but a cinematic masterpiece.

David Urassel can be considered one of those directors whose strong point goes back to his mastery of the tone of his films. Tones that are sometimes different and show the director's high flexibility. In Silver Linings Playbook, however, Urassel has achieved a balanced mix of comedy, drama and romance. A combination with deep and believable characterization, fascinating conflicts between characters and a story with a relatively new idea, and away from sarcasm and ridicule, puts laughter on the lips of the audience for a moment. Laughter that can sometimes be painful.

16 December 2014,"Following his release from a mental institution, a man comes home to live with his parents. He soon meets a woman in the neighborhood, and they bond through their oddities","Pat Solitano is an interesting man. The audience meets him just as he is being released from a mental institution after serving his time for assaulting the man who was sleeping with his wife. Though he remains aware of his problem, he refuses to take his prescribed medication, and he struggles through his time on the screen. With a mind disillusioned with the idea that his wife who left him still loves him, and that he just needs to talk to her, Pat is visibly incompetent of letting his past mistakes go. Although his parents do their best to point him in the right direction, he insists on trying to go back in time. When he meets Tiffany, he finds someone who he can use to send written letters to his ex-wife. As time goes on, however, he begins to realize that his past life isn't important, and that the present (Tiffany) is what he should pay attention to. Tiffany is troubled in her own way. Her husband was killed from a fatal car crash, and she hasn't been the same since. Looking for some form of solace and acceptance, she became, shall we say, a loose girl. She has made herself a vulnerable object, and she is desperate for a way out. Once she meets Pat, she finds someone who is suffering in his own way. Though at first their personalities clash, they soon find that the other is exactly what the other needs to go through life. Pat Sr. is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, or at least that's what he is on the surface. With dreams of a restaurant of his own and his savings on the line, the older man has become very frenzied with the success of his favorite football team. Although he denies that superstition has become a part of his game-viewing routine, he has exceeded the label of a ""crazed fan"". Although it does not initially come out, he truly cares for his son, and he soon puts his entire faith in his son's ambitions.

My Thoughts This is a film about people. Though the plot itself is somewhat basic, it is the people that flow through it that make it the great film that it is. On multiple occasions, director David O. Russell has been quoted as saying that he doesn't care how the script works out, just as long as the characters are presented in a manner that conveys the script's message(s). Though he had a relative success in Three Kings (1999), the director finally hit the big time following the back-to- back successes with The Fighter (2010) and Silver Linings Playbook. Like many other directors, Russell frequently works with the same handful of actors, and this grouping is quite an impressive bunch. Though he has just begun an undoubtedly promising career, the director has repeatedly worked with Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Robert De Niro. If he can keep being at the helm of gem like he has done so far, I cannot see how he cannot join the ranks of the best directorial careers in cinematic history. The acting across the entire cast in this film is one of the best I've seen in a while. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both brilliant in their portrayal of the complex Pat and Tiffany, and Robert De Niro delivers a performance that does not take over the movie, but it fits perfectly into the supporting aspects of the film. This film received quite a bit of critical attention, and it was nominated for 8 Oscars: Picture, Best Actor for Cooper, Best Actress for Lawrence, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro, Best Supporting Actress for Jacki Weaver, Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Film Editing. Although the lone win was for Jennifer Lawrence, I found Cooper's and De Niro's performances to be very notable. I attribute this large amount of losses to the fact that this particular year in cinema featured a large amount of great films that were based on historical events, particularly Lincoln and Argo. Based on the mission to save Americans stuck in the Iran Hostage Crisis, Argo took home Best Picture, and as for Best Actor category, Daniel Day-Lewis took home the award for his performance in Lincoln. Though I mean this as a joke, it could also be a true statement; who isn't going to vote for Abraham Lincoln? I think that this film brings to the screen a great collection of characters, and I recommend this film for that same reason. Now I must warn you, the language is quite bad. Though the F-words do fly, they fly with purpose. Contrary to some films where curses are used as frequent as punctuation, this film only uses vulgarity when it is necessary to portray strong emotions and feelings. This is a film where you have to stay focused in order to acquire the full experience. Though it may be slow at times, it is the characters that drive this film, not the plot. A bit slow at times, and I have trouble accepting the fact that Pat Sr. would bet on his son's dance performance. I understand that this shows that he is caring for his son and what his son wants, but I found this a little too cliché for such a great movie otherwise.

21 April 2019,Don't listen to what the reviews say,"Don't read these reviews and make a judgment of the film. If you want to see the film, watch the film, then make your own decision. All these criticisms are just personal opinion and aren't a majority- the amount of middle aged biased men on here are outstanding...This isn't a review, this is a plea to just watch the film, and see what you think. There is no point seeing a film through someone else's eyes. Because everyone is different. Everyone has different thoughts and opinions, you may love the film you may hate it.

22 April 2013,"We essentially join Pat on a road to recovery of sorts, a process made even more difficult by the introduction of Tiffany.","""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows the life of Pat, once he moves back into his parents' house after being released into their care following a court ordered stay in a mental institution. We soon find out that Pat was sent to the institution because of a violent incident that almost killed a man, upon seeing his wife with another man. We essentially join Pat on a road to recovery of sorts. Throughout the film we watch him struggle to get his life back on track, a process made even more difficult by the introduction of Tiffany.

This is a film that manages to tackle several heavy, serious issues while maintaining a light hearted feel. This story addresses bipolar disorders, depression, O.C.D, and adultery but it still manages to remain heart warming and actually quite funny. The story seems very relatable, I mean we all go through that one emotional, traumatic break up that seems impossible to get over. So we can relate to Pat and his struggle to snap out of it. Throughout all of the beautiful chaos that this movie exhibits, we are still sent a beautiful message about staying positive and determined and finding life's silver linings.

I think that the cast really helped make his movie shine. Robert DeNiro and Jackie Weaver played Pats parents and both performed wonderfully. DeNiro portrayed a man obsessed with his Philadelphia Eagles and his strange superstitions. He was very stubborn and stuck in his ways. Ms. Weaver portrayed Dolores, a quiet submissive wife and mother; who was very easy to influence and really just seemed obsessed with making her family happy. Chris Tucker delivered a surprising performance. He played Pats best friend Danny from the institution. I was happy to see that he switched it up for once. He played a very mellow character that was quite witty and funny without being over the top.

However, the actors that I think really brought the picture home were Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence was every depressed and dark in the beginning of the film but gradually began to open up and reveal her softer side. Eventually we got to see all of her quirky, spunky personality. She was really funny and beyond entertaining. I found myself really rooting for her. I was quite impressed with her portrayal of this character especially because this was a very adult role with a lot of grown up issues. It's nice to see her step away from her usual teen type ""franchise"" roles like those in X-Men and The Hunger Games. Bradley Cooper on the other hand, was just absolutely breath taking. He portrayed a very intense character and his emotional delivery was just bang on. He was just magnetic; I was whole heatedly rooting for him to find love and happiness. I think that this is by far his most serious and most mature role (and the same sentiment goes for Jennifer Lawrence). I was happy to see him take a step away from his usual roles as well. I firmly stand behind the statement that this is some of his best work as of late.

To conclude, I think that this is an absolutely excellent movie that truly does combine the very best aspects of a comedy, drama and romance films. It's full of witty humor, sharp and very direct dialogue; not to mention a multitude of life lessons about love, determination and self improvement. This movie really captures your attention and leaves you smiling on the edge of your seat the whole time. I highly recommend this movie because I believe that everyone could learn a little something from Tiffany, Pat and their friends and family about life and its silver linings.",9
16 June 2023,Some good but heavy handed,"So I am glad I watched it but just glad and no more. That gives it the seven rating that you see. I appreciate the topic and portrayal of the mentally ill main character. As others have said, the first half shows his torment and detachment from reality. I appreciate the other reviewers for elucidating some of the things going on in the movie that I wasn't able to articulate at first and this is one of them... as the second half goes into a romcom and loses the set-up and reality of the severity of the illness and detachment from reality.

I did find it a weird mix to have the mental illness with the quirky family. I mean I guess it was good that they show the OCD and violence of the dad. (I am amazed how people downplay the violence of both the son and the dad. This wasn't just ""getting mad"". )

And the dad's OCD, with the mother barely keeping it together, was portrayed within the context of weird? Popular American culture. Which is obsessive in its own right. The tailgate parties, drinking, sports fandom to the point of violence. So you peel back the layers on this movie and it I guess it shows a gradient from ""severe hospitalized detached from reality"" to ""coping at home but risking all of the family's finances"" to ""quirky everyday culture"" to what? Is the theme there is no normal in the centre of everything? And that's where my assessment of heavy-handedness comes in.

I think this won awards and I am not sure I can see it...",7
8 April 2019,Amazing movie,"Watched this movie for the second time. I am so impressed by the acting from Jennifer, the way she is talking, amazing

I would say this is probably the best movie from Jennifer so far.

2 January 2014,Predictable,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",6
23 August 2017,Wonderfully Different,"Wonderful film in which Bradley Cooper gives a stand up performance as a rehabilitating bipolar patient who is taught a thing or two about society's perception of crazy by a grieving widow. Fantastic performances from all sides in this unusual romantic drama, I was completely convinced from the get go and it is worth a watch for that reason alone, but the story is also original and entertaining in and of itself, so definitely add it to your watch list.

6 April 2020,Exquisitely made,"This movie touches my soul. The acting is done just right. It strays away from being cheesy while being full of emotions. The characters feel like actual human beings and interact as such. Stevie Wonder's ''My Cherie Amour'' appears in different sections of the film as a motif to show us the kind of struggle Pat (Bradley Cooper) faces in extracting the memory of his former wife from his life. The movie also has an emotional and honest take on mental illness. This is a treasure of a film that I find myself watching again and again. Definitely recommend you watch it.

9 August 2013,One of my favorite movies,"This was a good movie and I'm pretty sure it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I like this type of movies.

All actors specially Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany) and Bradley Cooper (Pat) did a great job. I'll wait for their new movie (Serena).

Jennifer Lawrence became one of my favorite actresses.

I always say that Bradley Cooper is a good actor, but he was always acting movies didn't show his talent. After watching this movie I'm pretty sure that he is a very good actor. He's very talented actor.

Robert De Niro and David O. Russell did the best in this movie.

16 March 2013,"In a boringly sane world, a bit of madness is something to celebrate","I am coming late to this film – after it got 8 Oscar nominations (with all 4 acting category nominations), and after a 22 year old Jennifer Lawrence winning the best actress award. I found it to be heart-warming story which approaches love and life with disarming honesty and directness.

The setup is unconventional – a guy chasing his illusion of love in a confused state of mind, and a woman struggling to overcome her sexual addiction while surrounded by men who are preying on her weakness. They both are trying to come to grips with their lives while living with imperfect families, imperfect friends, having imperfect relationships – and soon one forgets who has the mental disorder here. The film doesn't try hard to fit any particular genre; it is more serious than a rom-com or a chick-flick, but does not make heavy weather of the struggles of its characters battling their mental illness. The soundtrack really stands out and lifts many key moments to the music ranging from from Led Zepplin, to Bob Dylan, to Stevie Wonder.

The acting by Jennifer Lawrence is deserving of the Oscar and her skills are far ahead of her young age. I was a bit disappointed by Robet De Niro, he seems to have lost the edge totally and is falling back on the sort of roles he has done in the past. Anupam Kher plays a convincing part and its great to see him get his due for his talent.

In a boringly sane world, a bit of madness is something to celebrate. Must watch – 8.5/10 (from www.rahulbalyan.com )",8
3 March 2013,A difficult film to understand if you have not lived in the US,"With this film, Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for best actress in a strong performance as the main protagonist in showing how she handles a very difficult role of insecurities, psychological conflicts, loneliness, a dysfunctional environment and the shared moments with a bipolar partner. I did not like (or understand) the film in its integrity due to the local theme and the mood it was transmitted in a very ""American"" way containing: the admiration for football, the strange mood of protecting society from patients with mental problems, aggressiveness in the conversation .... finally jokes, slang were not easy to grasp, much less to understand his humor if the viewer did not live in United States for a while ..... this causes you to lose much of what was presented. The music, the performance of the main actors and De Niro as a father is great, but still, I did not enjoy at 100%l. Much shouting, verbal abuse in a dysfunctional family, bipolar treatment, intensity of the characters ......, superficiality in life .......

27 January 2013,Defies EVERY expectation,"THIS is the reason I want to be an actor, why I am taking acting as my form of higher education.

Everything about this film is just about perfect. The acting (THE CASTING), the direction, the writing, the cinematography. Even the length of the film sits almost exactly at the 2 hour mark.

If you are like me and you were/are thinking ""how in the world did a rom-com get nominated for so many awards"" you clearly haven't seen the flick.

The movie is hardly funny at all (although the parts that were funny made me burst out in tears), but filled with so much emotion. Like I said before the acting in this film was amazing. I have luckily never been diagnosed with bi-polar, but I know what mental illness can be, and this was a fine example of how one can act the part without making it contrived or offencive.

This isn't the best movie ever made. Depending on your tastes it may not even be the best movie of the year, but my god, it is damn good!

Go see it ASAP!",9
11 January 2021,Bradley does it again,"Bradley Cooper is such an under-rated actor. I can't stand DeNiro and because of him I almost didn't watch this. Jennifer Lawrence is OK but very good in this and the film is genuinely an enjoyable watch. There is real chemistry between the 2 leads , I only had to stomach through the scenes with DeNiro who needs to retire already. He stinks up every film he is in but this movie is too good for him to ruin. See it for Bradley, who is at his hottest best.

17 February 2013,"Warm and easy to like, with an appropriate title","David O'Russell is a filmmaker who is no stranger to the Oscars. His 2010 boxing drama 'The Fighter' garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and also managed to deservedly win two acting awards. Now, his most current film 'Silver Linings Playbook' has been nominated for an impressive total of eight, including the two highest honours, as well as receiving a nom in each of the four acting categories, becoming the first film do so since Warren Beatty's 'Reds' in 1981. But the question on the lips of many is ""does it really deserve to feature so strongly at this year's Oscars?"" Yes and no, frankly.

That's not to say that there's anything particularly bad about 'Silver Linings', it's perfectly fine, but is it the type of film that could viewed as being on even footing with some of the other Best Picture contenders? It's questionable, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't think so. Diluted down to its bare factors, it is essentially a feel- good romantic drama, which uses football as an instigator for father/son bonding in the way only an American movie could and depicts how people can manage to triumph over mental illness, in a manner that teeters into over-sentimentality. It isn't really anything you haven't seen before and becomes more predictable as the narrative progresses. Cooper's character is a teacher who has been released from a mental institution for nearly beating a fellow staff member to death, but we only get brief snatches of this as David O'Russell doesn't delve into the darker side of mental illness and instead softens any edges presenting us with an unashamed crowdpleaser, but this is something that is largely unforgivable as the film is ultimately rather charming.

However, don't get the notion that this is some sickly saccharine inspirational tale the like of which have become all the common, because this is a film which manages to narrowly avoid such territory and also has a rather appropriate title. Amidst the predictability of the story, we are offered a silver lining in the form of the film's acting. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano Jr., the man readjusting to life after a stint in a Baltimore mental institution, and while he might not be one of the greatest actors of all time, he induces his character with a certain zest and charisma that even the most cynical viewer may struggle to resist. Jennifer Lawrence on the other hand, has proved herself to be quite the talented actress in the recent years with films such as 'Winter's Bone' and this little movie called 'The Hunger Games' and here she continues on this winning streak. She's really great as Tiffany, a young woman who bonds with Pat, able to relate to his mental illness. With his role as Pat's dad, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance since 'Casino' in 1995, while Jacki Weaver offers fine support as his Pat's mother and Chris Tucker lightens the already-bright mood as a friend of Pat's.

'Silver Linings Playbook' is no masterpiece, but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable film and at its best when Lawrence and Cooper are on screen together, especially coming to life in these moments, where I found myself properly caught up in the drama. Elevated by strong performances, it is never less than watchable and always quite likable.",7
22 August 2023,So lucky I got to see this movie,"I started this movie with my girlfriend and didn't make it past the 40 minute mark before we went to sleep. A couple days later I remember mentioning to her how terrible I had found the movie, and she didn't agree, saying the only reason she wanted to stop watching it was because she was truly exhausted that night. Several weeks later, me and her are no longer together but I decided to watch the movie until the end.

I'm so happy I decided to sit down and finish it because this is up there in my favourite movies of all time now. The story is so beautiful, and the themes explored are bigger than just a movie. Going through my relationship with this girl definitely made me appreciate some of the intricacies of the movie more than I otherwise would have, but I'm certain anybody who gives this movie a chance will be pleasantly surprised.

P. S. Jesus Jennifer Lawrence is so pretty.

2 November 2014,Worth 3 Watches,"This was a recommendation from a friend. I was on hiatus from movies, which is probably why this got a full 10 when I finally watched it. And watched it, and watched it again.

I laughed so hard, and routed for these two ""crazy"" lovebirds. Pat, played by Bradley Cooper, and Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence play well off of each other. They are firm in their existence, and make us feel every episode they experience; happy, or sad.

It's been a while since i watched this, but I'd gladly watch it again, and again, and again. Then I'll update the review. I do want to say, though, it's worth the watch.

10 September 2013,A fantastic performance nestled inside an average movie,"After getting released from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and dedicates his life to patching things up with his ex-wife. Things start to get a bit more complicated when he meets the gorgeous Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has mental health problems of her own, and the two strike up an odd friendship.

The best thing about 'Silver Linings Playbook' is that you have some very good actors doing some very good acting. The film itself is alright, I wouldn't say it's great. It's based on a novel, and it's easy to see how a lot of the scenarios would play out better in prose; the writing, too, isn't always strong. Yes, it does have its moments, but I get the feeling that I'd probably have enjoyed it more as a novel.

But let's get back to the acting. It is the performances that make 'Silver Lining Playbook' better than it probably should be. Top of the heap is Jennifer Lawrence, who is just incredible. It's the film she won the Oscar for, and deservedly so. She's funny, tragic and pitiful all at the same time. Her comic delivery, her facial expressions, her ability to pull off the crazy mood swings as seamlessly as she does. This is the kind of performance you'd expect from a seasoned actor, not from someone barely in her twenties. Bradley Cooper is great too, and he probably would have gotten all the accolades had it not been for his co-star.

What stopped the film from being a great one was the portrayal of mental health. For the first half of the film, I was actually very impressed. The mental health issues are treated with sincerity, albeit with a strong tinge of humour. But as the film goes on, it starts to get a bit farcical and loses that sincerity. A shame, really. Had it been shown with greater care, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' could have staked a claim for being one of the films of the year. Instead, the film will be remembered for allowing Jennifer Lawrence to give the best performance of her career to date, and not much else.",7
24 November 2021,Good film,"Good film - the story is very well done, as is the cinematography, music, dialogue, etcetera, but above all else is the wonderful performance by Bradley Cooper and I never thought I would say that. I am not a fan of his; in fact, he was my least favorite character in the Hangover series. But, here, he gives the performance of his career. Notice how I didn't mention Jennifer Lawrence yet? Oh, of course, she's excellent. But, I expect that out of her. (I have yet to see her critically, and publicly, panned horror film of 2012, so in my mind, so far, that woman can do NO wrong.) Okay, I enjoyed her once again, but again, I already expected great things from her. I was shocked by how well Cooper played the bipolar hero of our story. Recently released mental patient, Pat (Cooper,) tries to put his life in order by being positive and reclaiming his lost wife at his side. All the while, he's unintentionally testing his elderly parent's (and the police's) patience with his uncontrollable outbreaks and being wooed by the great, and almost equally messed up character of Tiffany (Lawrence.) At probably too long of a length in running time, you know how this is going to pan out, but it's still suspenseful throughout because of the excellence of acting on the side of Cooper and his raging one moment to calm the next. I don't even know too many people with this problem, and yet, I know this is realism.

4 June 2013,Everybody has their problems...,"But it makes them what they are, and without it, they wouldn't be themselves, and that's what this film justifies so superbly. It's probably the best Romantic Comedy I've ever seen and it is so light-hearted and feel-good funny it'll have you wanting repeated viewings. Bradley Cooper is an American with some Italian origins who returns from a mental hospital to reunite with his ex-wife, not your usual rom com story, but it works. While he seemingly tries hard to do that, he bumps into Jennifer Lawerence, who also plays a one with problems, but as the Oscar-winning performance goes, it's absolute. Their meetings and such are so charming. And you see their similarties, and hear their separate problems. Robert De Niro hasn't been at his best in years, until now and he plays an OCD, football-obsessed dad who just wants the best for his son while Jacki Weaver plays Cooper's mother who is also good but gets shun upon by everyone else's outstanding performances. The film has it's flaws though, there is the length, and the predictability of it but that doesn't matter, Romantic Comedys are not so much for the story but the substance and heart of it, and this film does it just so right.",7
26 June 2013,A Depiction of Love Through The Meds and Chaos...,"Silverlinings Playbook begins on an uneasy feeling, a man (30's), Pat, is released from a mental hospital, picked up by his mother, who is adamant about getting him out of there asap. Pat has some anger issues that become too violent at times, threatening society. Yet, his reaction to a betraying act by his wife seems justifiable to me...in a moment of rage with the wedding song playing. The answer? Meds. Dope Pat up on prescriptions and cloud his mind. Put him away for a while to study.

The film fires up at the entrance of Tiffany, an alluring young woman who becomes an object of affection for Pat, in a peculiar and spellbinding way. The attraction is captured brilliantly and effectively. Love at first site pours off the screen. Follow this with a witty emotional script about love in this prescribed modern life. The moment we see this attraction is so aching to those who know this moment. It is a very pleasing time to recognize someone you could be with for the rest of your life...no questions...in silence, a look, a recognition of yes...risen from melancholy and regret.

A beautiful film to watch again, in segments. It is definitely trying to say something under the surface. Refreshing, fun, and potent. Great acting and casting was dead on. But, as we all know, Love is fleeting, as is sadness and regret, pain and happiness. A sequel might not be a pleasant experience. But, I'm optimistic as is Pat, who is designing his Playbook...",10
11 July 2016,Most nonsensical movie...ever,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",1
20 September 2022,Incredible,"I had this movie in my watchlist for a long time , but finally I did. Genius look at mental health, isolation and the struggle to get better , the casting was amazing and the acting was superior.

The way the movie is building up and characters development was absolutely perfect, the Chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence was magical. Shout out to Chris Tucker tho , he did well.

The dance scene was beautiful and I loved the tribute to pulp fiction, the ending scene it's so good that's pay's off for the build up.

My advice to you , escape all the reviews and just watch the movie and I promise you you won't regret it.

6 February 2013,"Great writing, great acting, great story","This was a funny movie experience for me. This movie takes on a very serious subject, and even though it is a serious movie, about bipolar people, and dealing with them, you also get to laugh and have some fun with them. The writing is so great, and you can tell that this story has personal experience with bipolar ism in the family. Great job! Both Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Cooper and Robert De Niro does a great job acting ways, and deserve the academy awards nomination that they have received, and i hope at least Bradley Cooper get's the award for best male actor. A great job! The story is so great also, and it's not a cliché love story that u might think when watching the trailer. A great movie! 9 out of 10 for me!

29 March 2013,Best Movie I've Seen In At Least A Decade,"Just when you would have been forgiven for thinking Hollywood had exhausted all ideas (going on recent years), consigned us to nothing but annoying animated crap, ior rebooting much loved (and better left alone) franchises, comes this movie.

It is easily the best movie I've seen in a decade, if not much longer.

Cast: Perfect, not a soft performance amongst them. Bradley Cooper shows that he's not just the Hangover guy, or the comedic lead, he's a seriously good dramatic actor and deserves respect for this role. I myself have aspergers and have some behaviours that identify with bipolar sufferers. At no point was Bradleys portrayal less than believable to the point where i identified with his character. Respect.

Jennifer Lawrence likewise got her character to be believable as well, and must also be respected for her portrayal. She's utterly charming, when not being equally s schizo as Bradley. Being beautiful as well is just the icing....

Robert De Niro, just continues to be the best actor (with i think the greatest face) of our generation. We would all be happy just to watch him eat toast for breakfast in the morning. His character runs the gamut of emotions in this movie, just as much, if not more, than the other leads. He never disappoints.

Jackie Weaver, high time she got such a great mainstream role. a fellow Aussie, she plays the perfect caught in the middle housewife. great work! Im only writing about the characters here as thats what this film is about. There's no distractions, no big explosions, nothing to detract from the characters being fully explored and evolving. Not even Jennifer Lawrences amazing body in the dance related scenes distract you from staying superglued to the stories arc and following all the characters developments, because its that well done, and that takes some doing! I hope its not another decade before i actually see another movie that can even come close to this. Just perfect.",10

12 January 2013,An old school gem,"This movie has the same emotional tension that you would feel when watching ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" The acting is fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence continues her rise as probably the best actress of this age. She may not win the Oscar this year as Jessica Chastain also had a fantastic performance in Zero Dark Thirty and I expect her to win, but I expect Jennifer to be at the top nearly every year for the next 40 years or so.

The supporting cast is as good as you would expect from the known and unknown members.

This movie seems to get better and better as the minutes tick by right up until the end.

George and Audrey could have done no better.

15 January 2013,Excellent Excellent Movie.,"I must tell you that through out the movie I was getting a little exasperated. By the end of the movie though, it all came together. That was just the superb acting/directing/writing/producing coming down on me. Jennifer Lawrence...WOW! Her acting was amazing, and Bradley Cooper was terrific. And such a great supporting cast. I won't give it away, but how you feel through the movie is exactly how you should as you live the characters scene by scene. It comes to a masterful conclusion and I have a great respect for Jennifer Lawrence(She is not just beautiful folks),even more so now, and Bradley Cooper as well.

Not everyone can appreciate a well done performance such as this, but then there are some who made Honey BOO BOO popular too...just think about that.

26 November 2012,"A complex romantic tale about real, complex people and families.","The only thing Silver Linings Playbook suffers from is a case of a studio not knowing exactly how to market it. The marketing lead me (and others, judging by the mostly female audience in the theater) to believe this was just north of a rom com chick flick. The only reason I went to see it was because I couldn't believe that David O. Russell, notorious nutbag director of The Fighter, Three Kings and I ♥ Huckabees would make a rom com chick flick. I was right. This is a funny, painful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, complex romantic tale about real, complex people and families. Bradley Cooper delivers his best performance to date, De Niro doesn't phone this one in, and Jennifer Lawrence is adorable but perhaps only very slightly miscast. Can absolutely see this in the running for this year's Best Adapted Screenplay.

13 January 2013,"wellzzz, it was not such extra-ordinary movie to create the hype of getting the massive eight Oscar nominations!!!","Pat and Tiffany, two emotionally broken and mentally slight disturbed persons came across and knitted their romantic silver linings to the way of their sound life's playbook. Terrific performance from Bradley Cooper as he was the heart-content of the film :p De Niro was also there to draw another ""Limitless"" appearance with Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence took just another firm step in her promising career. Anupam Kher was pretty good also in a major role!!! David O. Russell, in his vibrant direction, brilliantly deals with the mentally special ability issues. Yeahhhh, Surely Cooper played one of the best leading roles in 2012. But wellzzz, it was not such extra-ordinary movie to create the hype of getting the massive eight Oscar nominations!!!

27 December 2012,perfectly cast actors - superb!,"Casting director hit gold with choice of actors. Can't imagine anyone else playing their respective roles more perfectly. Especially Jennifer L. who never looks like she's acting. Conveying deep emotional expressions naturally, (which you just can't teach in acting school), she may very well covet an Oscar for her performance. Ditto for Brad C. and supporting actors. The dancing sequence was a bit too short for me. Now I want to see Jen in ""Dancing with the Stars"" because she really IS a star! I'm sick of these, ""WHO? WHA? never heard of them"" celebs. Perfect match for MAX C. with her tall 5'9"" frame. And whadda figure!!! Barely a comedy as most posted. Deeper than the ""I"" meets so to speak. The football dialogue confused me. However, it's a football lover's paradise if you're into that 'odds' banter. Great movie! Will buy Bluray ASAP when it hits stores.

10 March 2022,Chaotically paced...but amazingly good,"I've waited too long to watch this.

As a fan of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, I should have guessed it would be a stellar performance from both. Sure, the pacing was chaotic and hard to get used to, but I found myself engaging with the story which weaved itself realistically with a cast of possibly all misunderstood characters. Family, relationships, personal struggles.. it all painted a relatable picture of quite simply, the human condition. And presented hope that somehow, someday, we can all be in the right headspace to see the silver lining...

28 February 2013,EXCELSIOR..That's what this Light Hearten Rom-Com is all about.,"O Man!! The last time I had the same feeling after watching any movie was with Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934), De Sica's Ladri Di Biciclette (BYCYCLE THIEVES), Hayao Miyazaki's Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (SPIRITED AWAY) or Shoojit Sircar's VICKY DONOR (2012) among few. These movies make me feel fresh after watching them. They kinda make my day. The life is already hard, and then movies like this work as a sheer relief to the hectic schedules and overload of work.

This is one of those movies where you can sit with popcorn and coke, relax on a lounge and enjoy the evening with one of the most fine Rom-Com of this year. The most appropriate movie for spending a quality time with your loved ones.

It is a happy-and-gay-feel movie where you need not try hard understanding the complications of it, you can just lay back and go with the flow as the movie promises a 110% entertainment. Its easy, smooth, fun, decent, clean, cheerful, light-hearten and beautiful.

BRIEF STORY & CHARACTER SKETCH

The movie deals with Pat's (Bradley Cooper) life after he gets discharged from a mental asylum. He is on a Restraining Order. He is completely devoted towards her wife who left him now and they are not living with each other. In the whole movie he struggles to get to Nikky, his wife in several ways while he comes across many harsh realities of life and explores the love. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a widow who finds solace in sex with almost everyone she meets, which has a really touching reason of doing so that she explains later in the movie. Pat Sr. (Sir Robert De Niro) is Pat's father who is a typical old man and is very superstitious. He is a bookmaker and a die-hard EAGLES fan. Dolores is Pat's mother who is again a typical old lady and want everyone in the family to be happy and at peace. And last but not the least is Dr. Cliff Patel (Anupam Kher) who is a psychiatrist (Pat's Doctor) and also a motivational source behind helping Pat & Tiffany to be friends with each other. The film is a light hearten one and hence the story does not revolve around a major plot but still never loses the beauty in its simplification.

OVERVIEW

David O. Russell has already proved himself as a director with lot of potential in THREE KINGS and THE FIGHTER. And this time he excels and out-stands all his previous works with SILVER LINING PLAYBOOK. Here he delivers his best execution till date with nice and decent camera angles and with a pacy, nice, crisp yet descriptive screenplay which he wrote himself for the screen. The production design is something to praise for and the editing by Jay Cassidy who also marvelously edited 'Into The Wild' (2007), its top notch this time as well. Bradley Cooper was at his equilibrium peak (specially in the scene where he tries to find his wedding video.) and could have been a clear academy award winner for Best Actor if Lincoln would not have happened this year. Jennifer Lawrence was at her best and Sir De Niro was as expressive as always with his evergreen expressions and natural yet flamboyant nature of acting, rest of the cast is also a great support as well and provides the expected performances. And the best thing in the movie - the background score - the music of the film by Danny Elfman, its so appropriate and soothing. For those who read the novel by Mathew Quick, trust me guys its still going to appeal you like all fresh.

RATING

I will rate this flick 8.5/10. Its truly one of the best films this year. And a must watch for all those who are looking to spend 2 hours watching a 'time-worthy light-hearten' movie with a shelf line. David O. Russell made it to the hearts of all this time which he lacked with his previous ventures and a vital support to help him in this if not the only one is Bradley Cooper. My man, this film goes to your performance. Two Thumbs-up for the movie!

Nudity : NO. Sex : NO. Language : GOOD enough to watch with kids. Drugs : NO. Violence : NO

6 January 2013,Wow! Delightful! Inventive! and Charming! Barely Cover its Attributes,"I'm going to keep this short...

David O. Russell is an Utterly BRILLIANT scriptwriter and that was the BEST movie we've seen (son and I) both in dialog and ability to capture the realities of life without dressing it up and sugar coating it with a pretty bow.

The fact that the dance mimicked the lead character's relationship and its wild mood swings was simply genius.

The lead actors (Cooper & Lawrence) were AMAZING in their ability to bring it to the screen. Jackie Weaver's portrayal had to grow on me, but she nailed it perfectly! De Niro - Spot on! Chris Tucker Smashing!

Mark Bridges, the costume designer was perfectly BRILLIANT in his selection as well. Really, costume designers rarely get recognized for all their hard work but truly there was perfection in the selection. That plastic bag had me rolling in the aisles!

Thank you Mr. Russell, Cast and Crew - BRAVO!

Seriously, I'd love a sequel - Thank You!!!!",10
12 January 2013,A game of two halves,"The movie was a traditional romantic comedy with a touch of social commentary on mental illness at the start. It was quite entertaining, Jennifer Lawrence very sexy and the the general level of acting was very good. I am not that surprised to see a number of Oscar nominations but given the lack of gravitas in the movie as a whole I would not expect to see any of it's actors winning the award. As regards Bradley Cooper, I have no direct experience of people with Bipolar disorder but have with schizophrenia and he seemed quite convincing in the start of the movie. His size made his frenetic episodes quite frightening especially in the confines of his parents' smallish house and he had me concerned for the welfare of his parents. HOwever, instead of a bloodbath what we got was a bit of father-son slapping and then a remorseful son gets back on his meds. After that is is basically a traditional romantic comedy.

15 February 2014,Love and Dance Solves Mental Illness?,"It happens everyday: two amazingly good-looking people with mental instabilities come together and solve each other's issues in a way only true love and dance can. Okay, no, but that's what happens here and it is completely enjoyable. Actually the nutjobs are the most normal people in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence deservedly won the Oscar, and Bradley Cooper did a phenomenal job too. I fortunately don't deal with mental illness (regardless of what my friends think), but the writers made it easily understandable within the context of the story, and of course the acting immersed you into the struggles. Anything that might come across as a crazy reaction or situation in any other movie makes sense here, and not in a dismissive way like ""anything can happen because they're crazy"". It's a family drama with heart, some laughs thrown in and a touch of romance, all in a believable setting (especially if you believe pretty people can be as messed up as anyone else). 8/10

13 May 2021,Drama of the survivor couple,"The drama movie depicts mental trauma issues of the two main characters; the lady has lost her husband in the 20's the intense situation made her libido out of control initially, eventually she elevates herself as the survivor by virtue of her passionate dance.

The man is out on parole on charges of assaulting the lover of his adulterous wife.

Both of them eventually manage to lead a normal life as a passionate dancer couple leaving the scars, the stigma behind them like a nightmare.

Jennifer Lawrence is able to establish herself a talented actress in her early 20's by playing a difficult role, she exposes the hypocrisy, the double standards in our society with the meaningful dialogue :- "" we're not liars like they are""

31 December 2012,A meaningful and entertaining portrayal of 'real life',"With De Niro on cast, how can you go wrong? I walked in with on expectations and very little known about the movie - it was all on a whim. I walked out with (admittedly) watery eyes and a renewed faith in the power of basic human relationships.

This film was so well-balanced in its writing, exploration of micro and macro issues and quality acting that I was so engaged and drawn in I felt strong emotions for each and every character in the film. It has been some time since I have seen a film in the theater that so moved me to write an online review. Hats off to everyone involved in this film -you should be proud. Bradley Cooper is top notch.

25 February 2013,Beautiful.,"I was surprised by this film. I hadn't expected it to be so good. I also was surprised by the top class acting from what I view as Hollywood actors. I thought they were both incredibly good in their roles. My view is that from the beginning to right before the end is it was a huge build up to this emotional ending which had me fighting tears back. The story line was so interesting, I mean yeah it was adapted from a book and I don't know how well it was adapted, but the way the story slowly folded out bit by bit was great. I liked how almost odd and quirky it was, which I think the characters had a vital role in. I liked Pat's constant fight to get his wife back (who didn't deserve him back in my opinion, and she should be the fighting for him) and the way he silently fought for Tiffany too. Tiffany was a complex character who was dealing with grief at the same time as falling in love. Bradley Cooper did an excellent performance, really incredible, and he did so, so well in playing this interesting character fighting to keep things straight and back to normal in the world around him. Jennifer Lawrence was at her best in this film, she really came out from what I'd seen her in previously and into this character who seems to be so simple to understand on the outside yet really on the inside she's a mess but still keeps strong. Both main actors did their best performance in this film out of all the things I'd seen them in previously. Supporting actors like Robert De Niro were extremely good too. All round, must see, excellent film. Go watch it!",8
23 February 2013,Meh...,"Silver Linings Playbook is an alright film. I found it mildly entertaining, but at the end of the day it's just another Rom-com (although kinda lacking in comedy). In my opinion It's not really worthy of all the hype or the Oscar nominations it received. Particularly when compared with similar films released this year like Perks of Being a Wallflower

As for it being a great depiction of mental illness... I'm a psychologist with a best friend who has bipolar and I beg to differ! It's a little unconvincing on this front the best it offers is a slightly accurate portrayal of mild depression and anger issues that wouldn't necessarily be recognised at a clinical level

overall just a little dull really!

14 September 2013,Silver Linings Playbook,"Silver Linings Playbook (David O. Russell, 2012) An absorbing film with top-notch performances from the main actors, Silver Linings Playbook has much to recommend it. Its structure is a bit predictable, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence just about make up for that. It's good to see DeNiro in a serious role that doesn't send up previous roles he's played. Without having read the book, I'm at a loss to examine if the movie is faithful to it or not, but that's not always necessary in assessing an adaptation. I was highly impressed with this film in the early scenes, but as it went on I felt like I sort of knew where it was going, and for the most part I was right.

One plot development that was pleasantly unexpected was how Pat Sr.'s OCD began to tie in with the romantic plot between Pat Jr. and Tiffany; I thought that was very well executed. At one point I wasn't sure which of the Pats I wanted to jump into the screen and hit. That is a testament to the fine acting displayed by both Cooper and DeNiro, that they were completely behind the choices made by their characters and did not downplay them or do a halfassed job with them. Storywise it also showed the similarities between the two characters: Pat Jr. may not have suffered from OCD as such, but he definitely had his obsessions to grapple with. Jacki Weaver should also be singled out for praise, playing her own character as having to deal with the issues of both husband and son, and doing so with warmth, grace, and humor. According to IMDb, Jennifer Lawrence was the most excited to meet Weaver out of all the rest of the cast, due to Weaver's role in Animal Kingdom.

Probably not the best film of 2012 (I still have yet to see a few of the big names, Argo and Zero Dark Thirty among them) but a very good film for all of that. 8/10",8
25 June 2014,Silver Linings Playbook's representation of mental illnesses,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5

22 April 2020,Warm but trivial,"A story of emotional trouble relies on another story of healing, very funny and very inspirational, dancing can be said to be very bloody, but the plot is a bit trivial and cliché, the ending is a bit fake.

9 December 2013,Seriously!?!? Awful!!!!,"I read ALL this hype and this big 8/10+ rating - and finally rented this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE movie WOW what in the world??? Be glad I can't rate negative because I sure as heck would. What would people even begin to see in this disaster? I did stick it out to the end *yawning and thinking ""how fast can I get this back to the red machine?""*

Simply put - acting? ehhh well if you can get past the lame storyline, the yelling and screaming, the annoying girl who won't stop pestering the psycho guy in the movie - you might could rate it.

I don't know what else to tell everyone - STAY FAR AWAY - it's not even work the buck I spent renting this.

12 January 2013,Silver Linings Playbook,"David O. Russell's new movie, Silver Linings Playbook, is completely different from his last, The Fighter, but somehow, both films have the same energy. It's hard to describe, even though that's my job. I guess, if I had to call it something, I'd call it exuberant life, a kind of ecstatic energy that makes you just as excited as the characters in the movie. It's a rare kind of movie that's not only sick with a terribly fascinating disease, but it's also contagious.

Have you ever met someone who's been so down on their luck, so consistently bummed out of a good time, that they get excited the minute they think something's going to work out for them? They almost obsess over it? That's Tiffany and Pat. He's a bipolar teacher, just out of the looney bin- and he's desperate to do one thing- reconnect with his unfaithful wife, who has a restraining order against him for the same reason he was in the looney bin in the first place. Pat beat up his wife's partner in infidelity. Who wouldn't? Walking home to that? However, no dice. Pat gets locked up in the psycho shack. Tiffany, played by a pitch-perfect Jennifer Lawrence, is a young widow who's trying exhaustingly to compensate for the death of her cop husband by screwing, well, everyone.

It's not only a very good film, but it's also a unique film because of the way it tells a light human story in such a hard dramatic way. The most invigorating aspect of Silver Linings Playbook- and there are many- is its masterful script and the actors delivering the well-paced, careful lines. There isn't one or two great performances on display here. There are five.",9
8 May 2013,Not a documentary but good effort concerning bipolar I not II,"To start off, this movie is NOT about Bipolar II which is very different than Bipolar I. From the constant state of mania the lead actor is in, I would say this is based on traits of Bipolar I. Obviously this is NOT a documentary, but really a comment about what the disease is like through Hollywood glasses.

This movie did not show the depths of torment and anguish a person can go through when depressed. It was more so whimsical with the idea of a romance between people with mental illness issues. It think it would make an excellent film to show the trials of going to a hospital, interactions with society, frustration of not holding down a steady job - some can, but not often, and the more edgy side of trying to have a relationship with a person who has the illness and the misconceptions and hopes that go along with it. Nice try though, just not accurate in my experience. I'm not saying to go with a dark film either like Fatal Attraction which is more Hollywood too than anything, but I think directors and writers need to actually follow a group of people instead of dabbling with info about the disease. It's far more interesting than what is shown as temper tantrums. Those are my thoughts on the film. Entertaining is what comes to mind for this film.",3
22 May 2019,Flawed but okish,"--This movie has some genuine, touching, human moments, but they are few and far between. They mostly don't happen due to the movie's biggest letdown, which is its poorly written dialogue. It constantly tries to explain the plot directly to the viewer in the form of characters spewing exposition. This is because the characters aren't talking between themselves, they're talking to the viewer. And their choices of topics often feel unnatural and simply serve to further the plot. It's the sort of thing which will keep breaking suspension of disbelief if you notice it.

--Another problem is the way it handles its dramatic build-up. It seems to recognize where the buildup should occur, but the buildup itself, much like the dialogue, feels formulaic and hollow. As a result, it doesn't do a very good job of getting you excited for the story's payoffs.

--I like the directing idea of using the off-the-shoulder camera with close angles during various tense scenes in the first half of the movie, to try and relay the protagonist's anxiety to the viewer. The concept is very good and offers some nice shots which explain the mood of the scenes well, often without even showing the actor's face. But it in other scenes it feels unpolished, as if done without a clear sense of purpose. This is especially problematic when the movie has some very classical romantic comedy directing towards the end, which feels polished and slightly like the heart of the movie had already left the stage.

--All in all, this isn't a run-of-the-mill rom-com which is encouraging, but it lacks organic writing and a single design philosophy. These flaws leave it feeling rather bland despite some cool and honest moments.",5
22 January 2022,How did I miss this?,"My mother is bipolar.

This movie gave me a lot of joy, in quite difficult times. We live in such a harsh society. If you dont act and communicate the way you should according to normal, you are a crazy f*up. If you f* up, but keep it a secret, no one will no how much a f* up crazy you are.

The movie gave me a lot of joy. And it reminded me of how we should celebrate our differences and be thankful for adversity!

Me myself I am not diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But I do struggle a lot to fit in and find my place in this world. I have a friend, she is so different from everyone else. But she is one of the people that gives me the most fun and creative of times and also has a lot of wisdom of life to share. For that I am thankful.

This movie maybe gives some kind of picture of how people unable to regulate their emotions and feelings react when under a lot of stress or in manic/depressed periods. The scenes in real life can be terrifying. I was glad to see that no matter what this family where under in terms of difficulties, they never stopped loving and caring for each other. They were able to bury the hatchet so many times. This moved me a lot, and it moved me even more to see how two lost people, found them selves in eachother.

Regarding the celebration of diversity, it was so freakkin awsome to watch these two main characters dancing and having fun.

In a society of contest and perfection I give my biggest kudos to people who dare be themselves, perfect in inperfection.",10
20 November 2012,"sometimes silly, sometimes drama, often entertaining","Ever wonder how mental families keep spawning more kids? Honey Boo Boo away with the start of the next generation of a football Philly fan family complete with anger issue dad. Heir to the family rage meets whoring-as- therapy relative-of-friend's-wife and crazy slow romance ensues. I found myself entertained, often chuckling, sometimes shaking my head, and other times a little irritated at the sometimes not-so-little foibles of the many personalities on screen. It's a romantic comedy that stands a bit apart from the others, but I didn't find it as funny, light, or charming as 50 First Dates, my more preferred zany plot romcom. 6 or 7 out of 10.

27 December 2016,a touching recovery,"Looking at the summary before seeing Silver Linings Playbook (SLP), I could already predict the ending. A man obsessed with making up with his wife enlists the aid of a crazy, husband-bereaved woman. Only one thing can happen. Even so, the efforts Pat makes to improve himself, better himself, and to help Tiffany with her own issues, it touched me. Maybe it was the message of hope for fellow crazies. Maybe it was the message to ""read the signs."" The acting was superb, De Niro and Lawrence and Cooper all in one film, how the Eagles-obsessed family devoted its life to the birds and how Tiffany and Pat were just so honest to each other (not all the time, but still). Most of us don't say what we mean.

We need to look for the silver linings in life. We cannot lose an opportunity at love when it comes.

17 January 2013,Just great,"I started writing this review before the movie ended. WoW! Where do I start? Acting -- perfect. Casting -- prefect. Dialogue -- perfect. Plot -- perfect.

I did not see Jennifer Houston in the Hunger Games but I read the book and see how she would be very good for that role. I now see why she is a superstar: in addition to her superb acting, I have to say she's one of the hottest girls on the planet! IMO the combination of brains and beauty is perhaps the most wonderful of spectacles in the universe.

We expect the big names to deliver and he did, I mean De Niro. I can confidently say that Bradley Cooper is now a star (in terms of acting versatility).

Shea Whigham -- great in Machete, Boardwalk Empire and here as well; a very promising future. Jacki Weaver, boy was she wonderful. Julia Styles, loved her in The Bourne Ultimatum -- smart and sexy -- want to see her in more movies. Who else? Anupam Kher!! 100% great!

As a side note, I think Jennifer's somewhat Gothic look in the movie better suits her than the most recent pictures I saw on IMDb from the Golden Globes.

I'm pretty sure this is my favorite movie I've seen in the past year. 10/10.",10

14 January 2013,Is it deserving of all the hype?....,"So, I suppose with all the hype and Oscar nominations this movie received, I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect much of the plot, and I was right. However, the acting is simply amazing and makes this film more than watchable. Don't get me wrong I liked the plot, but it wasn't anything amazing.

This movie is about a man who was admitted to a mental institution, after he beat this guy he found his wife having an affair with, bit far fetched, I know. It is revealed though that Pat (Bradley Cooper) is bi- polar and that's why he escapes prison, to enter the hospital. Anyway, after Pat gets out, his whole life is based on getting back together with his wife because ""they're entirely in love"" and have a chemistry that ""makes people uncomfortable"" because its so strong, remember Cooper's character does suffer with a mental illness :P. Then Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), and it gets predictable from here after.

Yes, this movie is slow, Yes this movie is unrealistic in parts, Yes this movie doesn't correctly portray Bi-polar,but you know what, i actually enjoyed it. I thought Cooper was amazing!! He was funny at the right times, but matched this with his superb acting when Pat, his character has a breakdown. As for Lawrence, I've heard so much about her, but i didn't see any of her work. Its safe to say I know understand the fuss, I thought she was enticing, crazy but sane at the same time, just like the character is suppose to be. This was the perfect role for her. De Niro also adds a lot to this movie as Pat's OCD gambling addicted Dad. As for Chris Tucker, he made me laugh all the time, in fact I think he absolutely completed the movie.

Overall, I wouldn't say I get the hype about this movie, its nothing near a masterpiece but at the same time its 100 miles away from being poor. Its a movie you will enjoy because of the acting! if you're looking for an amazing plot, i wouldn't expect much, however Cooper, De Niro, Lawrence and Tucker make up for that with magnificent performance's.",8
27 March 2013,A reasonable movie that doesn't easily gets you.,"This was a bit disappointing for me. After listening so much about it I was hoping for something more. I guess that was probably the problem: too big expectations. Jennifer Lawrence character was indeed what most caught my attention in this movie. Exquisite would be the one word I would use to judge her performance and I must say I'm still not a fan of her... The movie isn't bad, but it isn't great! It's pleasant and likable and it has some funny parts, it only lacked something and this something was probably what cost it the Oscar for the best picture. If you ask me it lacks emotion. It is hard to connect with the characters, to understand the why they are what they are and that's an important part for me. But I'm only one observer.

8 December 2013,An amazing cast with great characters creates an unforgettable experience deserving of an Oscar nomination,"Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. I believe that this is due to the cast delivering excellent performances along with the obvious sense of great chemistry between them all. I expected this to be very predictable, as most romantic comedies are, but it was the exact opposite! I had no idea what would happen until it was happening right before my very eyes. David O. Russell did an excellent job of not exaggerating the mental health aspect of the characters, while still making those features prominent. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was outstanding, and very deserving of the Oscar she received for it! Her being beautiful doesn't hurt, either! I loved Bradley Cooper in Limitless and him performance in this movie reminded me why he is one of my favorite actors. Jennifer and Bradley have an amazing chemistry that allowed them to seem real to the viewer, you actually connect with these characters. This movie is an emotional roller coaster with the love triangles and the mental illnesses but somehow this amazing cast has managed to make it all work and make it all believable! Robert De Niro gives a very heartwarming feeling to viewers as he plays the father of Bradley's character Pat, who suffers for a mental illness due to a traumatic event. He is a very superstitious man that wants nothing more than to watch the football game with his son. Bradley did an excellent job of showing viewers that he will always love his family, although it may not seem like it at times. The twist at the end was such a shocker, and that is rare because normally I can call a twist before it happens in a film. I love that I couldn't pin this one down because it make it that much better when it finally happened! Another big part of the film is the soundtrack, as a good part of the film is based on dancing. The soundtrack was not a let down but wasn't the best I have ever seen. I feel that it fit the movie well without adding much. One exception to this was the song Girl From The North Country by Bob Dylan & Johnny Cash, which was used in a very touching part of the film. The only bad part of this movie is when the credits come rolling.",9
15 April 2013,Soooooooo disappointed,"I was so looking forward to seeing this, I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I like the actors and thought that this film would be something really special, highlighting the illness and also the wonderful people that have it, often very kind and funny people who suffer from terrible depression one minute and hyper spells, where they are happy but can be a complete nightmare the next. The film was so bad, I just can not get over the story line. I know a few people who have bipolar (type 1 as well as type 2) and watched it with one of them. I read that my hero, the wonderful actor De Niro has a son who suffers with this illness, how did he think this story was plausible, I will never know. I so agree with some of the other reviewers who did not like it, it seems falling in love cures it, and they will live happily ever after. Also can not see why the best actress award went to Lawrence, it was a reasonable performance but really nothing special. I am completely mystified by the whole hype, Oscar for winning actress and story. I wish I could have loved it.

24 April 2013,Silver Linings Playbook: I suspect its a bad movie for well-meant academics?,"I'm a teacher in need for some therapy.

Can anyone convince me to see this movie? I haven't seen it, but read some reviews. It has very very high scores - but among the film enthusiast, all-eating-movie-genre-crowd I see very very low score, regarded as shallow, uninteresting etc.

My experience from here in Norway as a teacher in primary school is that movies loved by my colleagues getting a high score - normally is boring, uninteresting and have a known script, that you easily forget. A movie that gives you nice feelings - have some fake depth to it that is easy to love and talk about for the random movie visitor.

A movie that makes them feel good about themselves. A movie easy to talk about at work, with the friends at dinner: I've seen this (deep) interesting movie. Blah blah blah.... One of the reviews strengthen my feeling :"" Such a great inspiring film for all. It makes me want to be a better person--for SURE!! Great story line. So passionate, reaches deep into the soul of family, friends, marriage, love, compassion, understanding of others, how we question ourselves and others."" Blah blah blah

Yeah – so be a better person then – without this movie – don't pollute the internet and waste bandwidth with your deep-felt views. Go! Go and be a better person.

Oooops. Sorry. Got carried away. Nothing wrong with the reviewers feelings . I'm genuinely happy for him/here.

But hey. We are talking film history here. This extremely high score? One of the best movies in ever. Hard to buy. For a movie to get scores like this at IMDb - its a movie that get the academic crowd out to the movies - and so happy that they leave a score here at IMDb. My theory. What's happening? Is IMDb becoming the Mc Donald's of fine film reviews?

Maybe I'm really wrong? Maybe the movie is good – not the garbage I suspect? Please tell me. But before you tell me - state if you're an academic please.

This could be a lot of fun - from my workplace I know for sure that academics have sensible feelings and are easily hurt. Normally they hide their inner beast very well. If somebody hurt their feelings – they smile. Its OK. But at home, or at lunch they spew their hatred and racism – hidden behind a cloud of words. Meaning nothing other than make them seems to be sensible people. But push them a little - its there!

So. Get it on. Be your inner self. Be your worst. Please state your hate and self indulged bigotry. I have given you lots of ammunition to talk your talk. I can't wait for your moral disgust! And maybe. Maybe. Some of you will convince me to see this piece of garbage named – Silver linings Playbook.

Ha ha ha.. As you know – I'm a teacher after all – in need for some therapy.",1
20 January 2013,A great movie (Except for Act 3),"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",6

25 December 2012,Excellent Character Study,This film was excellently written and had solid performances by the cast. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job in this role and is one of his best performances in my opinion. Equally matched by the stellar young Jennifer Lawrence this showcased her exceptional acting skills. I found myself drawn to the characters and emotionally invested in their outcomes. It is not a film for everyone with the heaviness of the content however for those who appreciate fine cinematic experiences then I would highly recommend you see the film. Chris Tucker added a lightheartedness to the film that showcased his great comedic timing and depth that I have not seen from him before. Robert De Niro just seems to keep getting better with age and this film showed sides of him that we don't get to see too often. David Russell did a phenomenal job of directing such strong players and from the man who last brought us The Fighter I would expect no less. He seems to have a talent in allowing the actors to stretch the bounds of their normal comfort ranges and elicit amazing and heartfelt performances that we just don't see elsewhere. Overall this exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't be surprised to see some nods come awards season.,8
24 February 2013,"If you want to see the movie script of the year, see this film","Making a comedy about a terrible disease takes guts. And writing a movie script this complex and funny is no mean feat. But as someone who lost my only brother to this terrible, tragic disease knows, this was a reach into the most amazing areas of the imagination. Point is, this movie, despite it's flaws, pulls it off. Take a cast of powerful and magical actors, throw in a wonderfully portrayed EAST coast city, borrow a few shots from the movie Rocky and various dance films, and voila, that's it. It looks oh so easy, but took a ton of imagination to make it work.There are a hundred ways to criticize the results, but I say, surrender to what has to be one of the most clever, healing and fantastic comedies in years.There are few films like this, and there will probably not be another movie so human, and so very true again any time soon.

8 June 2013,Silver Linings Playbook Review: Can you find the Silver Lining in your life's Playbook?,"""Life is a struggle that no one actually survives."" It's a difficult thing to do, figure out how to cope with the world around you and the problems you encounter. Things are hard, they take work and even then there aren't really any guarantees you'll achieve anything. Is it any wonder that people go a little crazy? How crazy can things get though? Perhaps what's crazy is the world around us, or even the people in it. No matter what it is some people can't cope, or they don't cope very well. At the core of Silver Lining Playbook is the question of what do you do then. How do you deal with a world that makes you crazy? The story centres around Pat, a guy recently released from a mental institution after a traumatic incident sent him over the edge with a condition he didn't know he had. Now living with his parents, he struggles to figure out how to move forward when in some ways he is still very much stuck in the life he left behind. With no job, no prospects and a town full of people who know what happened to him, he tries to find some aspect of his life to hold onto while managing his condition. What he ends up holding onto is his wife. Very much out of his life since the incident, Pat becomes focused on the idea of getting his wife back despite the reality that he isn't allowed to communicate with her.

Sufficed to say this proves to be more difficult then it seems to him and he begins looking for a work around to this problem through his very supportive friends and family. There's only one problem, his friends and family aren't the benchmarks for normality either. And this becomes the perfect mix for a family rom-com with an interesting twist on it. It's long been a staple of the romantic comedy genre to question the idea of normal. Stories from the 80s and 90s were big on this kind of theme, particularly in the realm of the high school drama version of a romantic comedy. Since then many stories have tried to establish what normal is, or at least what we want normal to be with some success here and there.

For Silver Linings Playbook however, normal is in fact the abnormal. Most of the characters have some strange way of dealing with the world. But in particular what makes it all work is the quirky way in which Pat, as played by Bradley Cooper, lives in the world. He is very honest and direct with people about what he sees or feels yet he does it with a kind of charm and openness about himself that it's hard to feel insulted by him. Topped off by the fact that he has learned to try and look for the silver lining in even the most horrible things.

What's interesting is that because of the unusual nature of the characters, I was never quite sure where they will end up. Romantic comedies have a tendency to go in certain ways. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. More recently they've tended to get a little ridiculous with their story lines. This film feels neither ridiculous nor cheap. It goes for the emotionally honest moments and with Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Chris Tucker and Bradley Cooper in the roles they manage to hit them pretty well.

Can you find the Silver Lining in your life? I can honestly say that this movie is something of a silver lining in my life right now.

23 November 2012,A Surprisingly Good Movie,"Saw Silver Linings at a preview screening just a couple of days ago. I wasn't 100% sure I wanted to go, but thought it would make for an acceptable date night with my wife. What a surprise! Brad Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Nero were pitch perfect. Avoiding the cinematic trap of becoming too maudlin over the problems of the romantic leads, the film was both funny and touching. The script had me guessing until the very end. Highly recommended.

I also have a slightly different perspective to add based on my professional experiences in the mental health field. The lead character's diagnosis didn't fit very well with his on-screen behavior. Portrayals of the hospital weren't 100% accurate either - but then they didn't need to be to move the story forward. Still, the film showed genuine compassion and respect for the struggles of the mentally ill. I especially liked the way that the story gradually revealed the deep quirks of those around the romantic leads. Mental illness isn't always a black or white issue - it's a matter of degree.",8
13 July 2020,Harvey Weinstein and his star pupil JLaw,"This was not a good movie. The Weinstein brothers manipulated the reviewers and the academy to give this movie good reviews and an Oscar to JLaw because she played by the Weinstein rules - why do you think she hasn't done anything of note since this or since Harvey got busted. This was a dull movie and a flat presentation from JLaw as usual. Bradley Cooper and DeNiro are always great but this movie sucked.

14 September 2013,Buddhism and Tsundere,"Recently, I read several books about Buddhism and wrote the entry ""Exoteric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism: Buddha, Wittgenstein, and Me."" In this entry, I summarized Buddha's teachings as follows.

========== Early Buddhism was exoteric. Buddha's original teaching was very simple. Our lives are full of pain and nobody can run away from it. There is nothing eternal and everything is changing in this world. He said that we should just accept this. In other words, it is the truth that there was no way to escape our painful lives, but we just had to accept such a cruel truth. It is too hard for ordinary people to accept it.

==========

I watched the film ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and found the way how main characters in this film overcame their problems was quite Buddhistic.

The main character, Pat, played by Bradley Cooper, obsessed his wife, who betrayed him. He believed that his wife still loved him, but people around him knew that she didn't love him any more. He suffered from bipolar disorder, and his obsession about his wife made him lose control.

The opposite character, Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, obsessed his husband, who was killed by a traffic accident. She couldn't accept the fact that her husband was dead. She also lost control by her obsession about him.

Buddha might say that both of them should accept the fact, even if it was cruel, and it was the only way to overcome their pain.

In this film, they started training dance in preparation for a competition. At first, Pat couldn't understand why he should dance, but he became deeply involved in dance and gradually got freed from his obsession. While he was dancing, he didn't think about anything. Dance itself wasn't important, but devotion to dance was important.

Buddha just meditated and realized the truth, and Pat just danced and was freed from his obsession.

I'll change the subject.

The character of Tiffany was typically ""tsundere(ツンデレ).""

""Tsundere"" is a type of heroines in Japanese anime. ""Tsun tsun"" means being sullen or arrogant, and ""dere dere"" means being sweet or charming. At first a ""tsundere"" heroin behaves toward the main character coldly, and sometimes they fight each other. He doesn't understand why she is so cold to him at all. After they find that they love each other, she dramatically turns to be sweet to him.

Tiffany in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" showed up on Pat as an eccentric and rude woman. In other words, she was completely ""tsun tsun."" In the last part of this film, she turned to be ""dere dere.""

Jennifer Lawrence perfectly played the role of ""tsundere"" heroin and was so cute. Her performance was worth the Oscar award.",8
8 June 2013,Honestly?,"If you like overrated films with over-the-top acting, you will love this biz. I mean, how are you gonna put Chris Tucker in a film for no good reason. Not that I'm a huge fan of him or anything, but his role in the movie was non-existent and pointless. Way to go Bradley Cooper, you're so ""believably"" full of angst. Not. The best part of this film was Jennifer Lawrence (and no, not because of her ridiculous portrayal of a young woman with problems was almost as over-the-top as Cooper's). Just because she's attractive. It's literally the only appealing thing about this movie. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch a wannabe-Lifetime movie then go ahead.

20 October 2013,8 out of 10,"Like the combination of Jennifer and Bradley. They both had tried their best to give a price to their characters. Saw their achievement when seeing the movie.

'Silver Linings Playbook' leaves the audience curious since the very beginning in its own hilarious way.

The supporting roles have their individual importance inside the structure, and the dancing competition is a must watch.

There are so many specific moments all over the story-line, of course with full of energy. Yet noticed some dull or you can say 'senseless' scenes which brought a disappointed feeling.

20 January 2014,A Great movie!,"Finally completed the movie. What can I say? Exceptionally good movie, Silver Linings Playbook is. The message of the movie was very well presented; that there is hope for people who are deemed as outcasts by the society. And how love can control even the harshest of illnesses.

Every actor in the movie was extraordinary; especially Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence never fails to amaze me. The ease with which she plays different roles is breath-taking; surely one of the best versatile actresses in the industry. A very well deserved Oscar for the lady.

Bradley Cooper showed why he is one of my favourite actors; his performance was sublime - he showcased every emotion known to mankind in an exemplary manner, be it venting anger or oozing care. He did it all. He really deserved an Oscar for this performance.

And do I need to say anything about the legend Robert de Niro? I don't think I need to, but I still will: his character of Pat Sr., at times, seemed more crazy than Cooper's Pat Jr.. And he pulled it off brilliantly, as he has done for decades now. Actors like de Niro don't come every day, we should cherish him while we can.

A shout-out to Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker for their amazing acting as well.

A 9/10 movie for me.",9

10 January 2013,The gem of 2012 !,"I simply adore this movie ! It's not just a romantic comedy, it cannot be underestimated cause there is a lot to get from this movie.

Firstly, Matthew Quick wrote an amazing book and the movie is nothing but a perfect adaptation of the book.

The best ensemble in a movie for such a long time. Bradley Cooper is amazing, catchy and shining; MR.DE NİRo to be respected cannot be assessed by me, Jenny LAwrence's best performance ever, Jacki Weaver is simply a star and greatest Australian actress, Chris Tucker makes the movie fresh and Anupam Kher is just enjoying to watch.

What can I say ? 8 Oscar nominations, 4 Globes, 4 Sag and ^3 BAFTA. There is nothing to say anymore. Please see this movie, read that novel and start to search for your Silver Linings !

One last word: I LOVE PAT !!",10
22 July 2015,Hilarious Romance,"This movie was great. Great acting by Cooper, Lawrence, De Niro & even Tucker. O. Russell did a great job directing this movie.

Pat & Tiffany are just two characters who the audience can find themselves attached to and can also learn a thing or two from. They are funny and relatable in more ways than one might think that they are.

I've been seeing people say that it's a boring movie, but honestly, if you find the patience for it, you will eventually begin to understand the film. Along with if you've read and enjoyed the novel by Matthew Quick.

Moving along, the performances of De Niro and Tucker were very realistic and attachable. Cooper & Lawrence did the most phenomenal jobs trying to beat one another in who is the most mental. Altogether this was an excellent film that I would recommend being watched by people of all ages. Although starting off slow in the beginning, it proved itself otherwise.",8
3 March 2013,Deserves all the accolades...,"Pat Solatano ( Bradley Cooper) is serving a mandatory eight month sentence in a mental institution. He feels he is now ready to leave and reclaim all that he has lost.his wife, his career, his home, his life. His mother Dolores (Australia's Jackie Weaver) has agreed to bring him home and as part of his release, he must live with his parents. His father Pat Sr (De Niro) is unaware of this agreement. It doesn't take long before we realise this is a family fractured by their son's mental illness. It is not an angry, bitter fracture but more a silent resignation of how things are.

Pat Sr is recently unemployed and is attempting to make enough money to start a new business via bookmaking. He bets mostly on the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The entire family are unswervingly loyal Eagles supporters and the rituals and superstitions that go hand in hand with this obsession. well let's just say that it is easy to see where Pat Jr may have inherited some of his ummm quirks.

Pat does not want to take his medication for bipolar disorder because he doesn't like the way it makes him feel. This causes some interesting moments, some amusing, some rather serious and as anyone who has lived with family or friends who are 'off their meds' can attest, it can go either way at any moment. One of his biggest goals is weight loss. It is never addressed exactly how much weight he has lost during his stint at the institution but as most people comment on how well he looks, one can assume it is rather significant. To this end, Pat runs every day wearing a full tracksuit and a black plastic garbage bag..the garbage makes him sweat thus hastening the weight loss.

It is during his daily runs that he is consistently 'ambushed' by Tiffany (Lawrence), a young woman he was introduced to by a friend at a recent dinner party. Their initial interactions are awkward and mildly hostile. Tiffany has issues of her own and she seems to instinctively know how to push Pat's buttons. The two form an almost unbearably uncomfortable relationship with the most basic of social interactions difficult for them. Yet it's good for both of them, this much is obvious and thus gives the fledgling relationship momentum.

Tiffany agrees to help Pat win back his wife and he in turn agrees to enter a local dance competition with her. The relationship changes and flourishes as the pair prepare for the competition.

This movie is touted as a dramatic comedy and there are some laughs but it is heavier on the drama. And this is a very good thing. The developing relationship between this emotionally damaged pair is lovely to watch. It did take me a little while to warm to this movie but in hindsight, this was possibly because it was very real.

The reality is that most of us are damaged in some way and just because you are not diagnosed or on medication is irrelevant. Too often in movies the dialogue between couples is fluid and clever and witty. This rarely happens in real life, despite what those dating website advertisements want us to believe. There are awkward pauses and confronting comments. The wrong things is said and reacted too. You try to be on your best behaviour but why should you have to be? Why should someone not accept you for who you are? And that is the secret to this movie.

It is about relationships that are not perfect between people who are not perfect. And that is okay. We learn to adjust and live with and love these non perfect people and if we are very lucky, they will love us right back. We can try and fix ourselves and try and fix those we love but when all the superficial stuff is gone, love is just love. Sometimes the one we love is not the one for us and we have to deal with that before we can see clearly. Most of us have been in this situation and can relate to the frustrations and pain that it causes. To lose the one you love, no matter how it happens, is painful. It's what you do next that is important.

Try and see this movie because it does live up to the hype and all the awards are richly deserved.",8
21 July 2013,Silver Linings Playbook simple review,"Silver Linings Playbook. At first i thought this was a reference to something that Pat, Bradley Cooper's character owned. ""Silver Lining's Playbook."" I was proved wrong once i watched it but that is what i thought at first. Pat is mentally disabled and diagnosed mentally ill. We pick up on his life when he is released out of a mental institute. His father, Pat Sr. (De Niro) is also diagnosed mentally disabled. His mother is normal. He is taken home, his parents house, to try to restart his life. He aims to get his old teaching job back and his love life back on track. He meet Tiffany (Lawrence) and the story takes off. While watching this movie i thought it was great, cute but i didn't think it deserved a Best Picture award. It was a great story and great ending but i felt it was a little bit too much of a ""chick-flick."" The cinematography and and camera angles were very cliché. Although i don't think the film deserved the nomination i do think that it was great, it was the best possible way to tell the story. I couldn't imagine the story being told any other way. If anyone was to try then it might be horrible. The production was satisfactory. In my eyes they didn't exactly hit it out of the par. The acting was able to hold up where the production dropped. Robert De Niro played his character so well. So did Cooper with his character and i see a Leading Actor Oscar in his future. There isn't very much to say about the movie other than that if you liked it that is cool, if you didn't that is also coo. This film wasn't mean to be loved is what i think. I feel like this film was meant to show the versatility of the actors and actresses in it. So if you haven't seen it go ahead and watch.",6

10 February 2013,Why this movie doesn't work,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",3
2 April 2013,A phenomenon!,"This truly is a beautiful movie... Enough said! I would leave it at that but IMDb requires 10 lines in a review so... Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence make the best on screen couple since Ross and Rachael. The twist is, none of them are truly happy. With a supporting cast like De Niro, Weaver and Chris Tucker, there was no way this film could go wrong.

Bradley Cooper makes the movie real. He is amazing in portraying Pat, a victim of bipolar disorder, and Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as the 'Good Girl'. Pat and Dr. Patels therapy sessions are a nice change of pace as well. ""Read the signs!"" Watch this movie! You won't regret it! (This film definitely deserves all the awards it got!)

15 February 2013,The only way to beat my crazy was by doing something even crazier.,"Directed by David O Russell

Starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro.

Written by David O Russell and Matthew Quick.

'After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.'

With all the hype and nominations this film was receiving, I didn't believe it would be as great as critics acclaimed it to be. Though this film isn't a masterpiece, it was a satisfying watch with plenty of personal messages.

I was very disappointed with David O Russell's last picture ""The Fighter"" and it was his directing that almost didn't make me want to see this one. I would have made a terrible mistake. He was great. He told the story so well with the setting it introduced. It couldn't have been a more common neighborhood and all the actor's were so natural that it made it a 'one-two combo!' The cinematography was descent in this picture. It was all normal. The only aspect I enjoyed was some repetitive camera movements that caught me eye to the great storytelling. The dialogue is great. Such a down to earth and natural flow. I noticed that the actors didn't have a problem with their jobs because the script did that for them. The nomination for Best Screenplay didn't surprise me.

The acting in this film was awesome. I'm not trying to take anything away from Bradley Cooper who did a great job but Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence caught my eye the most. At first, De Niro didn't get much screen time so I couldn't really judge but once his character started playing a bigger role, I was impressed. He hasn't lose his touch with age. His dialogue, his emotional acting and his character's mannerisms with OCD all came together to get him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I was hearing a lot of buzz about Jennifer Lawrence before I saw the film. Not only is she beautiful to look at but her acting is just as great! She makes her presence noticeable to the screen. She doesn't over act and try to let her actions speak for her. I saw her as a very natural actress and I bought everything she was saying. Great performance. The only flaw I saw in the cast was Chris Tucker. He was annoying and didn't really have a purpose in the story. Maybe he was brought to lighten up and humor the story but it didn't work for me and was not needed.

Music is often key to the story in this film – from Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"" which triggers Cooper's character's rage, to the medley of songs that serves as a backdrop for a climactic dancing competition. The Score brings an element to compliment the great acting and great storytelling.

Overall, this is a clever picture. It has some of the best acting and storytelling in film this year. Deserves all the acclaim it's receiving. A must see.",7
23 March 2015,Excelsior!,"It's without a doubt the best movie of the year. Everything about it is just so spot on. I hope it cleans house at the Oscars because it definitely deserves it. I just related to this in a BIG way. I've been pretty much exactly where Bradley Cooper's character was and I still deal with it on a daily basis. Even certain things that he did during scenes were things that I've done before. Just crazy.

The cast is absolutely fantastic. Cooper is so great. I've always liked him, but this is just so completely different from anything he's done and he sells it all perfectly. Lawrence is a revelation. I would say its definitely her most mature performance to date and arguably her best. DeNiro finally with a performance that actually means something. He's great as well and really proves why he was such a good actor in the first place and thankfully shows us what we've all been missing these last few years. Chris Tucker and Jackie Weaver are also there, but neither one is really given much to do in order to make a significant impact.

This so seamlessly blends the comedy and drama together that its kind of surprising. For a movie to make you laugh one second then put you through that emotional wringer the next is just great and its really an amazing accomplishment. Yes this movie does have a lot of the usual trappings that most romantic comedies have, but what sets this one apart is its characters and writing and commitment to seeing these characters through to end. This isn't your traditional McConaughey/Hudson bubble gum Rom-com where nothing really matters and we couldn't really care less what happens to these people...this is something different and something substantial and their problems are real and what they go through actually matters. These are people we actually care about.

So we don't mind if the outcome is a little predictable because the actors have created such rich characters that we like and who we wanna see happy and who we wanna see overcome their troubles. Life is full of struggles and it always will be. Wives cheat, husbands die, and football teams lose, but as long we have people we love and people who love us there to keep us going then we'll be okay. Time heels all wounds and we're all just looking for that silver lining.",10
18 March 2015,"Love is blind, but only before a marriage.","Silver Linings Playbook was a very pleasant surprise, and I say this with complete and utter understatement. It felt so good watching the film that I'm thinking I could have upped my rating a tad. Among all the movies I've seen recently, this one was the first one, the first American film that felt like a complete product, or work of art. After a golden generation of overachievers, there always comes a lesser generation struggling to find their calling. Their style. David O. Russell - I haven't yet read the book - adapted a love story that reached to me at a time when I wasn't looking for a romantic movie.

I didn't even know the genre of the movie. And I think the threadbare first half of it, lit up whenever Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) appeared, was a successful exercise in making a gritty romantic comedy. I liked how shameless the script was. The words never got vulgar, despite the grimdark subject matter. I knew something interesting was happening before my tired, jaded eyes when Tiffany asked Pat to have sex, and he refuses. We do have a glimpse of Tiffany's bare back, reflected from a mirror. The real flash of brilliance is that the mental illness of the two main characters, does two things. It provides a plausible reason for Tiffany falling in love with Pat. Secondly it provides an opportunity to sidestep the pitfall researching mental ill health for the sake of psychoanalyzing misery, pain, deprivation, alienation, and lust. The decision to say no both to sentimentalism and cynicism meant that the filmmakers simplified their task.

The best decisions are also the simplest. The casting director could have chosen any guy for the role of Danny. Instead they chose Chris Tucker, a guy who is no longer credible in any role he plays, walks by or flies over. Instead of trying to bulk up the lean running time of the film by introducing Tiffany's mum and her own issues, we get only what's important. This is reflected by the empty, renovated garage where Lawrence and Cooper will practice their dance. Lawrence says she thought of putting a ballet barre there. I loved this movie. It felt good watching it. As soon as I realized Lawrence and Cooper will not copulate, and do drugs, I realized I was watching a chick flick, but I forgot the set up quickly and didn't care if it was a feel good movie. Not what I even dreamed of, but it was retrospectively the best film that I could have seen. The characters of Tiffany and Pat are going to live happily ever after. Tiffany says that she didn't want to have children. Smart girl. Hope the review has been helpful to you.",8

20 December 2022,My Scorecard (8.4),"What a beautiful love story was told and what incredible healing powers does love have. Heartwarming story that is impossible to miss out, especially if you watch it with your loved ones.

I loved the movie, it was so sweet I couldn't think of anything else other than that love story. The constant reminding of inadequacy, then betrayal, anger, revenge, a break-up, rehab, purpose and then a methamorphosis. That's all the movie in a nutshell, simple but effective, feelings that hit you directly in your chest, wonderfully delivered by the excellent cast.

I would like to compliment Jennifer Lawrence for how well she portrayed the feelings of Tiffany: the jealousy, the pain of being constantly judged, the feeling of being labelled for life, but also the ability to take care of someone, the empathy, the will to aid her fellow friend. Bradley Cooper, who is one of my favorite actors, never disappoints, especially when he plays happy ending scenes. But the real surprise was Robert De Niro, that magnificly portrayed a complex father figure with a lot of bad habits and problems but, also, a man with a big heart that loved his children.

I smiled almost all the time I was watching the movie. I loved it. Sweet.

SCORECARD

In a range from 1 to 5, i'll give a value to each entry written below. The final mark will be the weighted sum of each fraction:

Subject (2.5) = 5/5 Development of the Subject (1.5) = 5/5 Direction/Screenplay (2) = 4/5 Attention (1) = 4/5 Recitation (1.5) = 5/5 Musical Score (0.5) = 5/5

Final Mark: (2.5 x 5/5) + (1.5 x 5/5) + (2 x 4/5) + (1 x 4/5) + (1.5 x 5/5) + (0.5 x 5/5) = 8.4.

29 September 2013,An Amazing Movie.,"This film has everything. There is beautifully written script that held fantastic off-beat humor, and flawless acting that I believe was by the entire cast. Bradley Cooper has given a performance that I think a lot of people never expected by that guy from The Hangover. Jennifer Lawrence gave a performance so fantastic that I think she is going to be a great actress to follow for years. Robert De Niro was well Robert De Niro he was fantastic as always. Chris Tucker was fantastic in his small but hysterical role.

I can say if you want to watch a off-beat comedy with excellent dramatic acting in a exceptional script do not hesitate to watch this beautiful film. This is a film that can make people that are having a bad day be happy. It can easily be in my top 10 films of favorite movies of all time Honestly.

4 December 2012,Wait for it to come out on cable.,"If something is marketed in a certain manner, I expect it to be how it is marketed. While ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is nice character study film, it's not what I would call funny. A few chuckles, yes. But once again the promoters mischaracterized this movie as a ""romantic comedy."" It was more of a story about two, while sympathetic, pathetic people trying to work their way through mental issues.

The story was fairly interesting, but it left a lot of loose ends as it shifted gears between one story focusing on one set of characters and then over to another story focusing on a different set of characters. The ""Philadelphia"" inside jokes and characterizations were funny, but you only get it if you're from the area.

The primary actors do a very credible job with their parts. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence provide outstanding performances and are very believable. While I usually like Robert Di Nero, he just didn't quite fit this particular role and I thought he was a waste.

It's a movie you could probably get wait until it comes to cable. And you won't probably won't laugh.",5
11 June 2020,Just a review.,"This is my favourite romcom of all time with all the great story and the great characters.But with all this the movie still has got flaws in editing and dialogues that don't fit and I might as well say directing flaws because some events don't match up. But still I love to watch this movie over and over again because of the beautiful story that keeps you entertained throughout but still what bums me out is the flaws that might look small to some but they sure look huge to me.This could be one of the greatest romcoms ever.Just saying.

When I chose this movie, 5 star from a review was an important factor. And it said this i not a typical romantic comedy was a convincing factor to bring our son to the theater for family time.

Plus the line ""Asian Invasion"" - I couldn't believe that I heard it! I didn't ask my family whether I heard it wrong as I did not want to bring up race issues and spoil our family time.

Anyway, I found that I heard right on internet. The ""Asian Invasion"" line was already discussed.

It is really shame that this movie got 'Best Picture'.",3
20 April 2013,Not at all worth the hype!!,"I don't review movies but for this one I had to. The story was alright, the movie was alright, but not at all worth the hype it received and I just could not understand what was so extraordinary about Jennifer Lawrence... there was nothing serious about her acting at all, over done at times and unnatural.

The other cast was good. Robert De Niro was a great relief on the screen, Bradley Cooper was very convincing. But the movie lacked high drama and depth.

Compared to the many movies that came out that year, I just did not see this as anything extraordinary, definitely not worth the hype and acclaim it received.

Personally, I did not see any silver lining in this one. Worth a 6/10.

2 February 2013,I have experienced life with people like these.......,"and I found the movie to be straight forward and honest. I think Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. Of the three leading movies I have seen this year, Lincoln, Les Mis and Silver Linings Playbook, I enjoyed Silver Linings the most. And now because I have to fill in ten lines for this to be posted I will now just put in words. This requirement is stupid. It is like making you say more than necessary to get the point across. So I will say once again I really enjoyed the story, the characters, the acting was as good as I have seen in a long time. Of course this is not the same movie situation as others that are in the running. So you can see all you want and make your choice.

25 May 2013,Not Everyone Will Like The Movie But Who Understands It will Rate It 10,"So i believe this movie is not for all people, Only those who can understand the situations, emotions, feelings, will surely rate it 9 or 10...!!!

All characters were good specially Jennifer Lawrence, She simply nailed it and was a deserving Oscar Winner for this performance, Bradley Cooper was amazing loved his acting, Robert De Niro,Jacki Weaver,Chris Tucker all of them were amazing,

Movies like Silver Linings Playbook, The Descendants, It's Kind Of a Funny Story and all other movies like these are the ones that need attention and understanding capability to know how good these movies are...!!!

10 June 2013,Your (Almost) Typical Messed-Up Family Gets All 4 Acting Nominations at the Academy Awards,"Silver Linings Playbook is the Oscar-winning cake you get when you mix the following ingredients: Harvey Weinstein's production skills, David O. Russell's directing technique, and a terrific multi-generational cast (from Robert De Niro to the thrilling comeback of Chris Tucker). Today being the US-release of the DVD, I had to celebrate by reviewing this universally acclaimed movie. This story adapted from the novel The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick has already helped and will help so many misfits. Unlike most of the audience, I don't think the characters portrayed in this movie are nuts. I found a lot of myself in both Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who have just been damaged by life. SLP is a simple story about families and the constant struggle it is to maintain relationships. O. Russell focuses on many kinds of relationships. From parenting to friendship, love, or sibling tension: whatever your problem is, you will find an answer in SLP. I adore the O. Russell technique that reveals his actors' talent. The movie was nominated in all 4 acting categories at the Academy Awards which hadn't happened in 31 years. Jacki Weaver does a mean Philadelphian accent. Robert De Niro in the role of a father with affection and addiction issues is captivating. Weirdly enough, Cooper and Lawrence is an on-screen couple that works. I actually forgot that she is too young for the role because she delivers such an intense performance. She is the only one who came back home with a well-deserved Oscar. I was delighted by Cooper's radical mood swings or Lawrence's defying monologue to De Niro's face. It's a pleasure to see Tucker as Pat's friend from the institution and Julia Stiles as Tiffany's control freak of a sister (and now we can all agree that Stiles is a much better dancer than Lawrence). SLP will speak to the common folk because you can relate to the characters. It is about family issues, coping with loss, football, addiction, dancing like 'dad at prom', and fitting in. Silver Linings Playbook is about life.

1 reason to watch: If you find yourself misunderstood by your relatives, this will give you hope and give them insight.

10 August 2013,"""Silver Linings Playbook"" And The Lessons Learned","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

31 December 2015,Jennifer Lawrence is flawless,"First time first I must say that I hate you David O'Russell for making a movie that not only full with great performances from its cast with a great story, but also make the drama light enough to be called as romantic-comedy and open up the possibilities of being liked by a lot more people.. The plot is simple, it is a family movie that tells stories about hope, love, and chances but the script just made this movie more and more entertaining to be watched.. Jennifer Lawrence's performance describe it all with her Oscar that she received from this movie, she's really flawless especially with the help of her other movies 'The Hunger Games' that also released in 2012.. Bradley Cooper, I just can't realized he can turned his performance to be an A-class Hollywood actor when the first time I know him I thought he'll trapped in a lot of comedy movie (Silver Linings is a comedy movie too, but different from his other previous movies).. Robert De Niro I guess there's no need to doubt his acting, while Jackie Weaver completed the performance with her 2nd nominated Oscar performance in this movie, two years in a row which just make her one great commodity actress to become the mom in a strong drama movie.. The other performances from the other cast were good too, Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles, John Ortiz, well they just need to be sharpen a little more so they can be turned into a diamond that shines.. Overall, I agree about this movie as one of the best movie in 2012 and I'm totally in love with Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this movie..",9
5 November 2021,Give a medal to Silver Linings Playbook,"A much more concise and pretty story than I was expecting, Silver Linings Playbook is definitely more of a feelgood movie than a film about mental health.

I've e never seen Cooper in another film outside The Hangover and he's a completely different actor here, which paints him in a very different light for me, I'm very much looking forward to checking him out in his other movies. Lawrence is golden and beautiful and powerful as always. The rest of the cast are the rest of the cast.

You can get past the fact that Cooper and Lawrence don't quite pull off convincing portrayals of mental health - to their credit it's very hard to do well and they both equally give it a good shot - because the meaning and energy behind what's going on here is more powerful than its individual parts. None of the characters are that special, none of the shots are that memorable, none of the jokes are that funny....but....but....the way I felt as the credits roll has remained with me for some time now. Maybe I'm warming up as I get older.

It kinda does exactly what it says on the tin I guess. Though like I say I wasn't quite expecting the emotions I felt. The last 20 mins felt a bit rushed but it just held itself together for an ending that certainly had me welling up for all the right reasons.",7
1 February 2013,The Only Best Picture Nomination that actually earns it.,"Nothing makes me happier then to see an actor people just think are comedians or just okay and then they turn out to be great actors. 2012 is the year for proving you're acting chops, with Jack Black in Bernie, Matthew MacCoughney in Killer Joe, And supporting role in Magic Mike and Sean William Scott in Goon. Although these performances where largely ignored and do deserve Oscars, Bradley Cooper also knocked it out of the park as a bipolar man who wants to put his life back together after a major breakdown. I always told people he'd get an Oscar one day after I saw Limitless.

I'm not going to go into the story, because really that's a second hand and it's really a character piece and also a study on mental illness. That being said every single performance in here is great. Even Chris Tucker, someone who I thought had absolutely no range, really knocks it out of the park. Bradley Cooper really transforms himself into a beaten down, but really genuine person. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well turning in a more emotional and raw performance but still just as good. This is an actor's movie and everybody showed up to do work.

I have ultimately nothing really negative to say about this movie. Normally these ""Oscar"" movies have really bad pacing, too long, and you can feel the ego coming from behind the camera. Nope David O Russell Clearly just wants to tell a good story. Normally I like darker movies, like Black Swan, so anybody thinking this is a sappy, sweet movie you're absolutely wrong. This is an incredibly sincere movie. I teared up I laughed and I liked all the characters. Definitely a surprise for me and hopefully, but let's be realistic, at the very least this will walk away with at least two Oscars, not that it matters because this is still a great movie.",9

25 January 2014,Smart twist on the usual 21st century boy-meets-girl RomCom,"With so many films being made under the comedy/romance genre, all being so repetitive, the emotion really seized to get me the way it used to at once. So with my expectation not so high, I decided to watch this delightful number, and its probably the best film I have watched in 2012.

Every element of this film is done to perfection; well cast, well acted, well written, well directed. 'Silver Linings Playbook' is not only heart warming and funny, but it gives the audience a different kind of story line. Here the crazy characters don't just come in to be made fun of, but instead, are what make the story happen. This is a boy meets girl scenario, but it's not really.

It might sound insane, but I was able to actually relate to the characters, who were cleverly written to be exaggerated versions of people we often find around us today, or perhaps are just like us.

I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who is bored of the usual clichés and just want to watch something that would put a smile on their faces. If that isn't reason enough, then Jennifer Lawrence's brilliant performance and not-too-bad appearance should do the trick.",10
14 July 2013,"good trailer, bad movie","I remember seeing the trailer and wanting to watch this movie. The roles of a bipolar man and a nymphomaniac woman interacting was appealing

The mental illness aspect was overplayed in the trailer yet was very shallow and almost irrelevant. The dialogue seemed forced and pointless at times. The occasional outbursts from both Rob and Tiffany was decent but the interaction between them was disconnected. Rob was aloof, coming across as wooden. And Tiffany seemed disengaged throughout. Not a believable relationship at all.

It seems using a popular name like Hemingway draws interest but it really added no substance to the film. The premise of Rob being stuck pining for his wife was good, however, the acting deliveries were cringeworthy. I saw this movie on a top 10 list and shuddered.

The movie may be worth seeing for a fresh change of story and new elements to character background. Be warned though that the pace and story devolves half way through and the ending is despicable.",5
29 October 2021,The more I watch it...,"The more I watch it the more I dislike it. I really loved this on my first few viewings but the more I watch it the more the line delivery grinds on me... It's really terrible in some parts, even from De Niro (once to my memory). Anyway I didnt finish it this time although this is probably the 7th viewing I've had so that may be the reason lol.

28 December 2012,I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was,"I saw Silver Linings Playbook last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It was the best movie I have seen all year. I knew that I wanted to see it but it was nothing I was expecting. I laughed from beginning to end, cried and felt so much for the characters. Bradley Cooper was unbelievable. There is nothing more to say other than he deserves an Oscar for his perfromace. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well and Robert Deniro was so good I couldn't imagine anyone else playing his role. The writing, music, ending we're all perfect. I highly recommend seeing this movie and seeing it more than once, it is a must.

4 June 2013,Perfect,"Silver Linings Playbook is as an enjoyable two hours that you could hope to get from a movie. The four leads are truly marvellous – although I haven't seen too much of Jacki Weaver, it was great to see Bradley Cooper showing how much more he has to offer, Jennifer Lawrence confirming what most of us already knew and Robert De Niro showing there's life in the old dog still.

One of the more ridiculous complaints I've read is that ""It's not as good as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Well, no its not. But that movie remains one of only three to scoop the big five Oscars, so not being as good as it is hardly much of a criticism. Yes, the film is predictable. And I was thoroughly pleased at that. It's become fashionable over the last few years – almost clichéd in fact – for Hollywood to throw a curve ball at you, just for the sake of it. SLP gives you exactly what you want; it just does it with a wonderful script and fine performances.

I can honestly only see two reasons for someone not to like this. Either you've seen the acting nominations and vague plot and are expecting something in the league of Cuckoo's Nest. Or you're one of those darling people who link their film tastes directly to their superiority complex, and therefore shun anything popular. If you fall into the first category, then beware – this movie is wonderful but it's not an all-time great. It's a perfect comedy-drama-romance which does not try to extend beyond its reach. If you fall into the second category, then you need to wise up a little because you're only punishing yourself!",10
21 January 2013,Uplifting and cleansing movie!,"After watching this movie, I can see why it has been nominated for and won so many awards. At first glance, it may just seem like a typical run-of-the-mill romantic movie, but it goes much deeper than that. The movie is about Pat (Bradley Cooper), who has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a man who is working to improve himself to impress his ex-wife. He ends up meeting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who also suffers from deep emotional issues. These two awesomely unconventional individuals fuel the flames that make this movie so unique and so great.

Bradley Cooper's acting is incredible, portraying his bipolar and extremely straightforward character so well that you forget he is acting. Jennifer Lawrence also does a great job as Tiffany, showing incredible depth to her pain and the emotions in her life.

Besides the excellent acting of the two main characters, another great thing about this movie is how refreshingly positive it is. Honestly, as messed up as Pat and Tiffany are, most people can probably relate to them in one way or another. It is really interesting watching Pat struggle through trials to become a better version of himself. And deep down, aren't most of us doing that everyday; working to become better?

Maybe the reason this movie touches so deep is because it can speak to every one of us; to show us that you can be better. That no matter how messed up things can get, there is still hope for improvement. Excelsior!",9
20 January 2014,"Two misfits, running from issues, find love along the way","When Pat Solitano Jr. gets discharged from a court ordered stay in a mental hospital, the only thing on his mind is to reunite with his wife Nikki, who has a restraining order on him for beating up her lover. The audience is treated to an emotional sometimes funny roller coaster ride of pitfalls and obstacles Pat refuses to see. Determined to show his wife he is a changed man, Pat tells his therapist he doesn't need medication and chooses instead to maintain a positive state of mind and look for the ""silver linings.""

It isn't long before the viewer understands the scope of Pat's issues during his melt downs and violent reactions every time he hears his wedding song, (Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"") among other triggers. Tiffany Maxwell, a recent widow with issues of her own, meets Pat at his friend's house and sparks fly between them. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have real chemistry and the audience is immediately smitten with these two misfits. Aside from sharing the same kinds of medications, Pat and Tiffany seem to understand each other. Pat sees a means to communicate to Nikki through Tiffany and she promises to give Nikki (her sister's best friend) a letter from Pat, but in exchange he must be her dance partner in a competition.

Complications arise when Pat's father bets on a Philadelphia Eagles game, money he's been saving to open a restaurant. His OCD and unusual superstitions lead to some very funny scenes. As a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan he is convinced his son, who has been rehearsing with Tiffany instead of attending games is causing the Philadelphia Eagles to lose. This leads to one of the best scenes and major turning points in the film when Tiffany having been stood up, confronts Pat at his house. The outburst is hilarious and powerful to watch. The stakes go up when Pat's father raises the bet and uses his son's dance competition score as a parlay to win back his money. Now everything rides on the dance competition and Pat feeling the pressure, refuses to compete.

This movie offers an unusual love story supported by a very strong cast. Bradley Cooper was the biggest surprise for me. Having seen him previously in comedies like ""Hangover,"" Cooper gives an outstanding performance and proves he has the acting range to tackle complex difficult roles. David O.Russell's adapted screenplay based on the novel by Matthew Quick also does a great job as director of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and garnered two Academy award nominations. Russell was originally attracted to the project because his own son suffers from a bipolar disorder and OCD,issues addressed in the movie. Russell brings sensitivity and strikes a balance with the characters and their neurosis in the film. All four lead actors including Robert Deniro, (as Pat's dad) earned Academy Award nominations. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, gives a sassy multi-layer touchdown performance and won the Oscar for best actress.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is worth watching! Combined, with a marvelous Soundtrack by Danny Elfman,""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a terrific movie that scores big!",9
15 November 2014,"You know, it's something different..","Let's establish two things before I review this title:

1. Yes I'm watching the movie two years after it released worldwide

2. No I did not know its based on a novel until I saw the credits roll and I still haven't read the book

Well now that we've established this much (and you've decided whether reading this review is worth your time or not), let's jump right in.

Silver Linings Playbook is about a former teacher Pat Solitano who moves back in with his parents after a brief stint in a mental institution, and tries to reconcile things with his ex-wife. Tiffany comes in somewhere along the way and things get complicated for good ol' Pat. You know if you're reading the summary for the first time and you haven't seen the movie, I guess you'll have pretty much the same reaction as I did; what's so great about this movie? It just sounds too bland! Is it the power cast that fuels such a rating or can there actually be a good story here?

The answer is a bit of both. Bradley Cooper doesn't quite fit into his role so easily like how I do into my 40 inch waistline pajamas but he still does a good job. You want to see his character evolve because he comes out of the institution in a certain mental state and you expect that to change naturally in some way but then he overdoes it towards the end and that can be putting off; you don't radically change overnight, it's not quite possible. The more finer tuned performances were Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver who do a splendid job as Pat's folks. Their roles don't work best together but apart in those singular scenes as father to son or mom to son; that's beautiful drama right there. Moving on to Jennifer Lawrence, I really enjoyed her character in the movie and I found she played her role quite brilliantly. The rest of the supporting cast did a wonderful job as well especially Dash Mihok (read the wacko brother from Ray Donovan) who sort of just made me laugh every time he came on scene.

On to the story line, I did find it to be something different. I mean the outcome is sort of realized mid-way and/or after, but the movie is shot in such a way that it leaves you guessing as to how things might turn out for Pat. It's that beautiful combination of comedy and drama which leads to this sort of thinking. However I did find the story line to drag a bit every now and then; it could have been to lay more ground work and give us more insight as to how Pat thinks and reacts in situations. But again the simplicity of the story makes it a good movie to just sit back, relax and enjoy. It's for those quiet nights when you're by yourself or with that special someone and you just want to watch a simple yet beautiful drama.

So go on ahead and rent this one, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",7
12 April 2013,Nice,"Funny and excellent acting. Love Bradley cooper and Robert deniro. Hate Jennifer Lawrence's dull performance... One trick kind of horse. Bradley copper played a slightly bipolar ex teacher trying his hardest to win back his ex who he sadly lost due to his temper. Jennifer Lawrence plays a sex addict(surprise surprise) who's husband passed away. One day they have a chance meeting and... Well you can guess where it goes from there. A very unconventional, original and unique love story that provides a couple of laughs too. I would recommend it to any and all Bradley cooper, Robert DeNiro and romance/comedy fans. And it's not that I don't like Jennifer Lawrence, I don't have an opinion on her due to the fact that I don't personally know her, but her acting is tedious and quite frankly she's monotonous and tedious herself...

15 June 2013,Amazing movie!,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

18 January 2013,Smurfin The Web's Blog Review of Silver Linings Playbook,"What I Thought: Very enjoyable indeed. What I expected from the trailer didn't let me down in the full movie. The film is a romantic film but uses the subject of mental depression and issues to highlight how normal some of these people can be and that everyday things are just as important to them as they are to us. The relationship between all characters is one of understanding with the exception of the main two, who although suffer form similar problems, deal with them in completely different ways, but these differences bring them together in a quirky way.

The acting is superb here and the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence is very believable and this is yet another genre of film she has tried her hand at and excelled in. There are a lot of strings to her bow and her nomination for Best Actress is completely warranted here. I thought the story was endearing, engaging and there are some really good funny dialogue moments in the film that seem completely inappropriate but fit the scenes perfectly. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who play the parents of Pat and suffer his small but meaningful outbursts at the oddest times of the day are brilliant and also get nomination nods here.

Conclusions: Nice story, brilliantly acted and directed and I think its very worthy of all of its nominations. I do fear however that it will fall at the last hurdle, but it has definitely sneaked up on the rest of the field and deservedly so. I recommend this film and have to give it an excellent mark.",8

2 September 2022,"Nonsensical, static characters that exist to fulfill a role","Most of the characters in this movie exist primarily to fulfill a roll to advance the plot. His wife is ""a woman who cheats on him."" His mom is ""Mom"" - she hardly says or does anything the entire movie other than be a body for Cooper to talk to. The doctor is ""a doctor."" DeNiro is a guy who loves football to the point where every line of dialogue is about football. Everytime we see him he is a body for Cooper to talk to, or he's sitting in front of the TV. Lawrence is hopelessly, randomly, and nonsensically infatuated with Cooper. That's her thing. The brother is ""successful."" The policeman is """" a policeman. "" It's always the same one responding to the scene within five minutes no matter what day of the week, location, or time of day.

The entire movie is full of characters that you know one thing about, and that thing is drilled into your head repeatedly. The characters are so unbelievably one dimensional... Even if you didn't speak English you'd understand the entire plot because the characters are so simple.

And that brings me to my next point: why watch this movie? It's certainly not enjoyable. Bradley's acting is great (they managed to squander DeNiros talent, Tucker has a great cameo) but every scene is a dramatic argument or conflict. It's the most literally unfun and unjoyable movie to watch. It drags on and on and on, as if viewers hadn't spent their entire lives trying to avoid dealing with these situations.

Just a hard no on this. I don't understand the hype. Cartoon shows have more developed, relatable, and realistic actions from their characters than this film by a large margin.",2
13 August 2013,Best movie...in a slow year,"Not a good year for movies. So this one was a pleasant surprise. Excellent acting, intriguing plot, nicely filmed and at times unpredictable. Tricky plot to pull off without being cynical or sugar sweet. The actors, writers and director do their parts.

I was particular impressed at the quality of acting. I thought Cooper was a lightweight and Lawrence a one trick pony. Far from it.

The range shown in this movie is dramatic, not only by Lawrence but also Cooper. Hopefully Hollywood doesn't waste popular movie stars...that can actually act.

Well worth seeing.

25 May 2015,Loved it!,"This film is an excellent look at life with bi-polar disorder and love. It focuses around a man who is released form the hospital and he aims to get his life back on track. His father(Rober De Nero) wants him to try to be part of the family again but he pushed him too far. Pat(Bradely Cooper) then meets Tiffany the crazy woman who husband has just died. the two fall for each other and enter a dance competition. Tiffany is played by Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for her performance, is dark and hilarious at times. The film does deal with the disease in a serious way but does add in laughter to make sure the viewer dosen't end up in tears. The whole cast shine and the film was nominated for 8 Osacrs in total.

1 January 2017,A Piece of Art,"I'll start by saying this is my first review on IMDb, even though I'm here for almost 5 years already.

I'm an assiduous movie watcher and I really like all genres of movies but Romance is probably one of my least favorites. Why? Because apparently I've been watching the wrong movies. Today I saw ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and I realized that. This movie is amazing and if you didn't watch it yet, just stop right here and go watch it.

The plot is superb, the acting is incredible and it has an amazing cast. I didn't watch the movies from the others nominees to ""Best Actress"" but I'm sure Jennifer Lawrence deserved the Oscar because her acting was really good. I didn't watch ""Lincoln"" yet, so I can't say anything about Daniel Day-Lewis winning the Oscar for best actor, but I have to say that Bradley Cooper was just incredible as Patty and he surely was a serious candidate to that Oscar.

All in all this is probably the best romance that I have watched and it will most certainly change my opinion about romances.",9
29 July 2017,Loved It,"A really great film.

Has a truly feel-good vibe with an underlying serious theme.

Represents mental health struggles but always with a nice humorous tone.

Couldn't have picked two better actors for these roles, and they couldn't have embraced the parts any better.

Highly recommended.

16 August 2021,Perfect Golden Linings.,"The movie was very nicely shot and clearly depicts the love that blossoms in confused minds. It is one of the perfect romance comedy movies of the decade. Stellar performances by Bradley and Jennifer. And the screenplay was very well written. And the acting was pitch perfect. It is one of the very few movies nominated for all 4 acting categories. Overall... a perfect movie for those who want a refreshing romance and a good laughter.

18 August 2013,My Favorite Movie,"My favorite movie. I love this movie. It understands what I go through everyday (am not mentally challenged). The complex relationship between Pat and everyone around him is what i go through is what I go through. This movie is about detached people trying to find their way in this dark, pessimistic and cynical world. Everyone tries to find someone who completes them and these people are trying to either find them or trying to get them back. I love the way I feel when I am watching this movie. When I watch a movie and I love it I repeat it in my sleep. My memory might not be too good but I do repeat this movie in my sleep whenever I am feeling blue. When life hits you hard you can watch SLP and you will feel okay. This movie speaks. It has a beautiful soul. It gives a voice to people who can't speak. Jennifer Lawrence shines like a golden star. She plays Tiffany Maxwell with such ease that it makes me uneasy as to how she did it. It has romance, drama, jealousy, everything that one feels. I cried when Pat confessed his love for Tiffany, I smiled with amusement when Tiffany had her breakdown. David O Russell is the greatest director of his generation (You could argue but let's just agree to disagree). He does a beautiful job of carving a treat out of a book. I always like the book more than the movie but this is THE ONLY EXCEPTION. This movie taught me how to see the SILVER LINING in every bad thing. I love this movie and I hope you do to.",10
1 January 2022,Great character driven story,"I love stories that are about people - sounds obvious but you can tell the difference between one that's more plot / lore oriented and those that are propelled by the journeys their characters take. For me, this was one of those stories. I really liked Pat and Tiffany, I found myself rooting for them all the way while also being able to objectively look at how their behaviours were affecting themselves and those around them. Amazing performances by each actor too, but that almost goes without saying! The ending was slightly... cliche? Or maybe too easy, but I definitely appreciated it nonetheless.

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",9
18 January 2013,One of the best romantic movies I have seen,"This story isn't really to innovative and so is its presentation. It all reminds more of a normal American family that lives on the edge. And this exactly is what makes this so lovely and great. You would think that Robert de Niro who always plays brilliantly does the best acting and has the best character here. Or maybe Bradley Cooper, who already has proved his abilities lie beyond partying in movies like Limitless.

But really, the one who touched me the most was the character Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Her story and the things she did and told because of that made so much sense in so many ways. Every move she made, every emotion she gave just everything about her character was very well provided by an incredible acting job, one sure worthy of an Oscar.

If you do not wanna watch this movie by now, you might as well never watch anything meaningful in your life again. End of story ...",9

5 April 2013,As Good as it Gets!!!,"SL Playbook is a beautiful film. The special effects are the script, the acting, the directing and editing and the soundtrack.It's just a great blend of cast, script and director. The stories of Pat and Jennifer's recent challenges unfolds in a poignantly gripping delivery. In 122 minutes, there are no false notes, just a brilliantly built crescendo of their struggles with life's challenges. There's everything we experience in our daily lives, tragedy, heartache, joy,struggles and growth. I see few films that reach inside and touch my emotions in a deeply visceral way...SLP did, and continues to. It reminds me that whatever challenges I face, there are others with like or greater challenges, and that I am not alone in my feelings and struggles.

The Academy Awards nominations offer the ability to shine a bright light on film that otherwise might be lost to flashier offerings. SLP's nominations highlight the many exceptional efforts in this film.

Anyone with a heart and soul for their fellow man and woman should see this film, on the big screen where possible. You could spend a lot of time looking for better ways to invest 122 minutes of your life, and do as well.",9
10 April 2018,Highly overrated,"Waste of (my) time. I simply don't know why they make movies like this one. The inconsistency of the story is surpassed only by the melodramatic exaggerations of actors set to play sitcom roles. Another movie-reward for Harvey Weinstein's intimate friends.

1 January 2013,Best movie of 2012,"Well it took me a while to get to see it because I had to drive super far to see it, because of limited release. It was worth it! The chemistry is amazing, the writing is amazing, everything is AMAZING about this movie. And the ending had a great silver lining

I was so involved with this movie that it stressed me out! With all the arguing, I found myself shaking my leg, biting my nails and felt like I was about to have a panic attack, because the actors made me feel what they was feeling.

Jennifer's performance is one fore the books and is better than her acting in the hunger games. She has really grown as an actress. The emotion in Tiffany's eyes when they was arguing in from of the movie theatre was so real. She really took it there for me. And Bradley Cooper surprised the hell out of me with his acting. I hope that they do more projects together, because they are meant to be.

25 November 2012,Feel-good rom-com.,"I really enjoyed this one. Solid plot and some extraordinary performances (Robert De Niro above all: I would give him an Oscar for this one). The way the main characters are rendered throughout the film is natural: it feels like they could really be someone you know in your real life. Also co-protagonists are gorgeously portrayed: Pat's family, the doctor, the neighbours (John Ortiz and Chris Tucker's characters are hilarious). Once again, Robert De Niro at his best: love the way he manages to give such depth to minor characters just by...'DeNiroizing', I'd say...them. Last words go for Jennifer Lawrence: she keeps achieving very high standards in basically any films she plays in, whatever the genre is. Here she is even better than in Winter's Bone, IMHO. And astonishingly beautiful. <3 <3 <3 Simply brilliant. Watch it.

18 February 2013,Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it Oscars good? Not even close.,"In essence, Silver Linings Playbook was a good movie. The actors were good, the script was good... But really, that's all it was. It didn't move me to tears, or even any sort of heightened emotional plane. It just.. was.

I thought by not seeing the trailer I would avoid over-hyping and then being disappointed later on, but alas, this was not the case. The rather lacklustre trailer pretty much echoed the film in its entirety.

First of all, I'm baffled as to why the movie is even called Silver Linings Playbook. He mentions Silver Linings a handful of times.. And doesn't speak anything of a playbook. So. That confused me. I at least thought it might have been about writing down his ""Silver Linings"" moments, but no. Even the notion or symbolic nature of a playbook or anything wasn't even present... So whatever. It was just him muttering about it now and then. If anything the film should have been called ""Excelsior"".

The acting was good. Bradley Cooper went further than he has before and Jennifer Lawrence was consistent as usual. Their performances were good, and the whole cast was too, as a whole. But did any of them really move me? Make a connection with me? No. Honestly, the best cast members were the supporting roles, and I was left feeling underwhelmed by the leads. The only one that came close to being interesting and who really BECAME his character was Robert De Niro. In my opinion, that's the only Oscar the film deserves - his supporting.

Also, as an editor I find it ridiculous that this film is even considered for an Editing Oscar. The editing is alright, but nothing to write home about. There were multiple continuity errors that took me out of the moment.

The story, apart from being a bit confusing in terms of the whole silver linings/excelsior stuff and a few plot points that fizzled into nothing, was good. It was a sweet and simple, touching story. The ending was a bit rushed and lame (I would have preferred it to have just ended at the concert at the end), but eh.

Also, as someone with mental health problems, I did expect to have more of a connection with the film. Alas, I didn't.

All in all, I did enjoy it. But would I see it again? Probably not.",7

12 January 2013,Wow,"This is as close as it gets to real life. At first i was skeptical about this movie, not sure about how i could relate to ""crazies"". But what caught me in the trailer was the twist of how much of a focus was put on being positive and the potential for a silver lining. In essence ""Hope"" So i took a chance. I haven't regretted it, from start to finish this movie was as crazy as you could get and i was able to relate to more than i anticipated. Thats because we all get a little crazy sometimes, but thats what life is about, being crazy, but the best part is what happens when he get passed crazy and how we look back at it. We need a little crazy sometimes, so we can live a little. I loved it and if you open your minds you will love it too.

25 August 2013,Silver linings play book,"My rate is 10, yes you heard me, 10. That means i'm impressed by movie. The thing i like the most about this movie is storyline, unique and really enjoyable to watch. Not usual love between two people who went through a really awful period. In start, that love between Pat and Tiffany wasn't so bright, they were just a friends in start with a pretty similar past. Pat tried to impress his (ex) wife, he just came back from mental institution and he decided to start new life. And Tiffany still was depressed of death of his ex husband and he became a sex addict. Friendship got a new meaning when Tiffany realized that she and Pat got so many stuff in common and they might be a good couple, but Pat still was blind, he thought his ex wife will forgive him about everything he has done. Tiffany tried to open his mind, but no, he still was blind. After some time, Pat actually realized all ""signals"". But Tiffany was kind of disappointed, everything happened on final dance tournament when he told her what he thinks about her and asked her for having relationship. This is short summary of movie, it won't be alright if i told you whole story, of course if you want to know more details, i recommend you to watch movie, i bet you will like it.

Point of movie - Sometimes life has different plans for us and we should use stuff, moments we got, god knows will we be able to get them again.

Also, i recommend for books addict to read book silver linings play book...",10
9 February 2013,Pretty Standard Rom Com with an angle,"This is your standard Hollywood Rom Com which is differentiated from the rest of the crowd by the mental illness angle. While this aspect is handled with sensitivity and respect I did get the feeling that it was just another device and did not really message anything of importance. The needs of the Hollywood feel good factor trump a realistic, more in depth appreciation of the huge challenges of bi-polar disorder and mental illness in general. While the makers should be applauded for at least trying to incorporate a controversial and difficult subject it felt shallow and unrealistic to me. Having said that the performances are generally strong (with exception of Chris Tucker who was just annoying) and Cooper shows some range and versatility. It's all too predictable though and while it's fine for passing the time, if you're looking for some insights in to mental illness in the mould of a ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or even ""A Beautiful Mind"" you won't find it here. Good, innocuous valentine's day fare.

29 November 2012,Unexpected Brilliance,"I went to see this film with a few friends really not expecting much, but came out with a feeling you really don't get an awful lot. It really made me think and feel, and that is ultimately what the best films do.

It comes across through trailers and short synopses as a standard run of the mill love story. The fact its got Bradley Cooper in it merely compounded this for me; I was debating not bothering at all. But, but: Bradley Cooper is sensational. He delivers a performance I did not believe possible - I see him in an entirely new light. He is helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is mindblowingly good. Fierce, funny and utterly believable, the two of them convey a chemistry that is not matched often.

The story is so much more than meets the eye too. Like I said, at first I believed it to be a run of the mill love film, but it is intertwined with so much more emotional aspects, family crises, mental illness and even the progress of the Philadelphia Eagles. I really don't want to give too much away because it is so cleverly binded together, but safe to say it is so much more than I first thought, and I thoroughly loved it.

They say don't judge a book by its cover and it could scarcely be truer in this instance. A real hidden gem, and an utterly fantastic film. A must see.",9

28 November 2013,The Silver Lining.,"Let me start off by saying that Jennifer Lawrence is my favorite young actress as of right now because of this movie, she and cooper have such a great chemistry together, i loved her acting. She and cooper are two people suffering from problems caused by different traumas in there lives, one being psychological and the other being physical/behavioral. You really connect with the characters, if your someone who has been or is in a similar situation you automatically connect with them, an no i am not just talking about having a mental problem, but having feeling that no one else gets you, that life is just passing you by while your living in your parents house and because you can't get over certain aspects of your life you feel like there is no way out unless you change completely. Well this is the story of two people very much alike in a weird but good way, the honest direct nature of these two individuals is just captivating you cannot look away, many of us have things you just wan't to say and release but you can't because of how people might think of you. Bottom line these types of movies aren't for the feint of heart and if you like, straight forward no bullshit direct type of movies with drama and some romance than by all means, watch this movie i highly recommend it.",9
23 July 2014,This movie will restore your faith in Hollywood,"In an era in which it is tough to find a film where you genuinely feel for each and every character David O' Russell's Silver Linings Playbook restores faith in the fact that it can still be done. It is a film that tell's a love story through the unique lens of mental illness. This unique lens allows us to look at things we take for granted such as relationships and day to day life in a way that shows how complex and difficult they can actually be. While at the same time showing how important it is to have these relationships because everyone needs the love and support of others to get through life. Whether it be dealing with mental illness or the loss of a loved one we often can't handle it alone and need aid from those who truly care to get through these times. This film shows the stresses that are put upon those who become the helpers while also showing that in the end the helping hand you reach out to others often pays off for you in the end as well. Helping others helps you and giving people a chance despite their mental condition or any other circumstance is worth it because you never know what that person has to offer unless the chance is given.

The film features one of the most beautiful, unique, slow-burning romances i've ever seen in a film and the climax is well worth the wait. It is a masterful work all around, the acting by Cooper and Lawrence as well as the rest of the star studded cast create the perfect mood and atmosphere for such a story. The tone is perfect and the issues that are dealt with in the film are handled in a gentle way that allows us to learn and observe throughout as we can see the inner workings of the characters minds via facial expression and wonderful script.

All in all I'd say this film is the best film of 2012 due to the fact that it tells one of the most beautiful love stories ever put to film in a way that not only entertains but educates and enlightens. A must see film. I didn't really delve into much of the actual plot and goings on of the film because I want you to be able to experience that for yourself, I felt that a review such as this one would show what I thought of/ took from this film in a way that would inspire others to watch it/ watch it again. Hopefully it worked. Thanks.",9
19 February 2013,Superstition at its best,"Wow, what a weekend of movies I had! Watching Intouchables, Seven Psychopaths and SLP in a row really made my Sunday. Pretty late that night I watched SLP. I almost decided not to... Was it the right moment? Ain't I too tired? Was it my kind of movie at all? Yes it was. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence really show great performances and proof how talented they are. The story is quite original yet not unpredictable. The movie includes laughs, drama and some great dialogues. Also it's nice to see good 'ol Robert de Niro back in decent action as a superstitious football fanatic! This movie isn't for everyone but if you're into movies like Garden State or Midnight in Paris, i'm sure you'll spend a good 2 hours with this one.

13 January 2017,"Well, this movie changed a life.","My sister dragged me to this movie. I wanted to run out of the theater during the first 30 minutes. It hit WAY too close to home. At the time, I was unaware I had a young adult child with bipolar 1. This movie helped me connect the dots and get the help my kid needed. Thanks for that!

I thought the movie was spot on! Nice family, just a little ""different"". The story was great, the acting was outstanding and it delivered a message. (More than one for me!). I enjoyed tremendously and was glad I stayed to watch the entire movie. Chris Tucker was one of my favs. I'm so glad they made this flick. I watched a few times.

You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5
25 April 2013,One of the best movies of the year! Must see!,"I can honestly say that Silver Linings Playbook has earned the right to be called one of the best movies of the year. In a long time even. Not only is it truthful and unforgiving, but it reveals the truth in such a humorous heartwarming way, that you are not even aware that you are getting the truth shoved right down your throat. Jennifer Lawrence gives a riveting magnetic performance, filled with powerful and unforgettable moments. After watching The Hangover, I wasn't expecting Bradley Cooper to give such an amazing openhearted performance. It was really a surprise. Robert DeNiro was fantastic as usual. Jacki Weaver did a fantastic job playing a mom who didn't have many lines or a big wow moment, but she stole attention from her scenes by just standing there. The performances, the story, and just everything was incredible. Really truly a must see movie.

12 October 2013,I'm getting the book,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

9 January 2013,It was very funny; definitely a must-see for fans of romantic comedies,"Yesterday, my friends and me went to the cinema and chose Silver Linings to watch. We all had no real idea what this movie was about except for being fans of both lead actors. What I remember from the movie today is that it was extremely funny, the acting was good but it was not one of the best movies I've seen.

The movie is using so many clichés and the typical ending. But still, the direct dialogs/discussions make it somehow special. OK, I didn't get the purpose of Chris Tucker (I guess it was only for the fun moments); him being such a stalker was more scaring than romantic; some parts where they talk was a tad too long and in comparison, the ending seemed rushed. And am I the only one who was not convinced by the ending?

But these points are just small. I still enjoyed it and this is definitely something for romantic comedy lovers. People who are used to action and similar may get bored at some parts when watching this movie.",7
1 February 2014,Silver Medal,"Jennifer Lawrence is the new Meryl Streep of filmdom. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence display the kind of chemistry in this movie that sells the entire story and the supporting cast is top rate.

A beautiful portrayal of the awkwardness and insecurity of two damaged people who are down but not out and who together find that silver lining. Excelsior!!

If you are looking for a romantic dramedy you should definitely make room for ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Keep the 3-D glasses in the closet and sit back and enjoy! Of course, the fact that I am a life-long Eagles fan is just icing on the cake here for me. Maybe one day, Pat and Tiffany will dance us to the Super Bowl Trophy!

3 April 2014,An Emotional Roller-coaster,"This movie is my favorite movie ever, it is an epic showing of everything wanted from anyone looking to be simply entertained from watching a movie. Bradley Cooper with a Performance worthy of an Academy Award (Dahm you Daniel-Day Lewis for being so awesome in Lincoln :D ) His performance matched with Breath taking performance from Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany hows how incredible this girl is and why everyone is going mad over her. A movie of simple brilliance - great acting , great story line , great humor and very relate able to for me which was another reason I found Bradley's performance so brilliant, Nailed it. The scene where he is looking for his wedding video is a brilliant showing of the emotional roller coaster that someone who is Bipolar, And Jennifer's nailed scene is the incredible acting performance in the diner scene. I can list incredible scenes all day, there was so many. All i can say to you is WATCH THIS MOVIE if you like movies like this Rom-Coms or comedy's in general then this is a must see. Watch and fall in love with the script and the characters.

27 September 2021,Accurate depiction of mental health,"Movies a bit all over the place in the beginning. It's supposed to. Stunning performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley cooper. The chemistry is strong with those two. Beautiful fall setting that oddly gets me in the mood for Halloween. Football fans and rom com fans will enjoy this movie. And anybody who has experienced mental health either first hand or second will understand and love this movie.

25 November 2012,Nice movie but over-rated,"Reading all the rave reviews this movie has been receiving and the user review of IMDb, I just watched this movie. I am an avid movie buff and here are my 2 cents. The movie is honest and has some great acting by Brad Coop and Jennifer Lawrence. De Niro and his wife also support well. Chris Tucker is wasted. The movie has a clichéd climax. It's not so feel good nor is it hard hitting and take you on an emotional roller-coaster. The only reason this movie is getting all the press is because of its A list starcast. Shoot the same with lesser known faces and this would have been trashed or relegated to the B levels. Seriously over-rated...watch it on DVD instead

16 January 2013,Loved it!!! 10/10,"you know when you watch a movie and you find your self just smiling through the entire thing.Every thing in this movie flows together so well. the story ,the acting .Especially the acting Bradley cooper did such a terrific job portraying this character ,he was such a pleasant surprise.Not that that's any surprise but how great was De Niro ,the guy is just awesome .Jennifer Lawrence as tiffany was also amazing she has such a wide range of expressions and emotion. This is really a fun well written heart warming movie that you connect with from the beginning ,it's not your typical comedy or romance movie or even drama. it's just a nice combination of all these together.

15 February 2013,A talented failure,"Strong points first. The film is a re-casting of the Rocky story. With a background in working-class Philadelphia, it deploys football and betting as substitute imagery. A strong cast makes the most of their witty and oddball lines; dialogue is contemporary and properly self-conscious and often very funny. Excellent cast and casting add production value. The film starts strongly and concentrates on details of character. A usable story line brings it all together, if rather predictably. Weak points next. This film is ostensibly about a father and son; in reality, it's about their women. That's because the writers know next to nothing about the male mind, ethos, or condition. This is a film written and produced from a male-feminist mindset. The football imagery is overdone, thudding, artificial, and excruciatingly cliché. The film is somebody's clever conceit, not a viable concept. The betting imagery is overwrought and far too clever to ever work. There isn't a female character in the story who isn't strong and wise, fragile, but unbreakable. There isn't a male character who isn't chatty, kooky, dependent, self-absorbed, foolish, aggressive, brutal, or just plain dull. The men couldn't survive 10 seconds without their gals, or without dreaming about them. In the end, the conceit gets tiresome and insulting to the audience. A film destined for Gender Studies and social edification.",6
3 May 2013,Not All Great But Good,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it.

7 May 2013,"Everything in the movie is about mental breakdown, and slowly and steadily, and quite comically you make sense out of it. You relate to the method in the madness.","Its a stressed out world indeed. And we are all stuffed inside this pressure cooker, dreading from the fact that we might grab too much of that mid flab, frantically transferring the balance on that god damned credit card to flash that Steve damned i Phone.

We have husbands and wives cheating on each other while they had acknowledged their unconditional love just the night before. We are super informed and more aware, except for two things. A substantial lot of us could be ""undiagnosed bipolar"" or a ""superstitious OCD"".

I know you might have never realized that, but that's what this movie does to you apart from making you marvel at the creative genius of the script writer, the director, and the acting cast.

There are Hollywood movies with a pent up storyline, and compelling and dramatic performances jazzed up with an out of world graphical realism. They most certainly come with the wow effect.

And then once in a while you have a farm fresh movie with a simple story but crazy characters. An Indian psychiatrist (Anupam Kher) preaching his patient about the importance of Excelsior and medication. The protagonist patient (Bradley Cooper) working on his strategy for his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Jennifer Lawrence as a self proclaimed and widely acknowledged slut with her own bipolar and medication to take care of. Robert De Niro in what he does best but with an added superstitious OCD as he is out of job and has been betting his balls off in American football.

Behind these characters is Bradleys mentally challenged desire to get back in shape and win his wife back who has been remorseless about getting hotter under the couples hot shower with another man. Jennifer is the one worth her salt by being the only one in the movie to confront this mental craziness with her overpowering bipolar.

When you have a once in a while farm fresh movie where everything is about mental breakdown, and you are watching it and slowly and steadily making a sense out of it. This, not through a nerve wrecking and nail biting storyline, not with a slapstick overtone, but through madly interwoven edgy characters. When you love it because you understand and relate to the method in the madness even if its remote. It is then you realize the creative genius of Silver Linings Playbook.

The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Its right there in the league of The Tao of Steve, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Jeff Who Lives at Home, and Our Idiot Brother.

It's only a lot crazier and a lot more better. It's my five finger and whole palm blessed movie.

12 April 2015,Jennifer Lawrence soars really high here.,"Silver linings playbook is easily one of the best movies in the year. This is a film that could gone wrong really bad and turned into into a big mess. But inspite of all , this film is hugely entertaining and has got some really solid stuff in it. Jennifer Lawrence is something else in this movie, her silences and condescending looks warn you of some imminent danger and bring subtle change is the movie's direction. Bradley Cooper is really good too and so is Robert De Niro. The reason this movie is able to stride forward without falling apart is because of the performances of the actors, one of the best in the year, and gripping screenplay, and unique visual style. However, my only disappointment is that the movie runs on well trodden story- boys with problems meets a similar girl and they find love. But the only excuse that I have is that there is good family drama too which prevents the movie from dwelling on a cheesy plot. It's a really good movie and if you haven't watched it, give it a try. Not a waste of time, I can guarantee that.

19 January 2014,Wednesday Thursday Friday........,"If I had a sucker fish in my bathtub It would just suck this movie off and then die by extreme nausea. I could not even jerk me off while watching Lawrence this time. I just wanted to make Cooper's face like a colon capital O and then puke in it. They should have blown each other's mothers while they were born. They were so bad that they kicked two ball's out of my bitch while she expecting a baby puppy. And thanks to them there is no exit for that poor puppy anymore. The movie is so religious that it restored my faith in God. Now I know that God exists so that he could build hell to throw those MoFus who created movies specially David O turd(may he be stripped naked in hell and his vagina be filled with dicks again). ""Please don't watch my movies"".... May it be engraved on his tomb.

29 March 2013,Watch it!,"Although I am not fan of romantic comedies and this is supposed to be one, this movie manged to break my stereotypes and surprise me with spontaneity of whole story.Characters are not one-dimensional so you don't know what they will do or say next(well most of time).Also actors portraying them are excellent in their roles so that makes you immerse in story and empathize with main characters.I would like Jennifer Lawrence character was given more attention,though,because it would be more interesting.Other actors were solid,not over the top,so they didn't draw attention from main story,and addition of Robert De Niro is major plus for any movie.I didn't notice directing at all,to be honest,witch is good thing i suppose. Anyway good movie to watch.It is not amazing,but it is really good.

4 August 2013,One of the best love_story,"Silver Linings Playbook is that rare film about characters with mental illness that manages to be quirky and sad and funny and charming all at once. Director David O Russell takes some serious themes and treats them with such humor and wit that you'll find yourself giddy from excitement by the end of it.Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a former teacher with bipolar disorder, who must move back home with mom and dad after spending eight months in a mental institution for brutally attacking his wife's lover. Pat's father (Robert DeNiro) is concerned for his son's health, but could do with some help himself for his gambling addiction and his OCD. Pat's mother meanwhile (Jacki Weaver) is incredibly patient with both men, constantly trying to broker peace at home by cooking up special treats.While working towards getting his life – and particularly his marriage – back on track through therapy, exercise, and positive thinking, Pat is introduced to the equally troubled Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow who's dealing with depression by sleeping with everyone in the neighborhood. This pair of crazies (literally!) trades insults, compares medications, and instantly forms a weird connection.Russell's script, brimming with originality and unpredictability, gives the film's terrific cast ""real"" characters to sink their teeth into. Even when the film goes into conventional rom-com territory in its second half – Pat and Tiffany enter a dance competition that means the world to her – the characters and their lines never stop feeling recognizably real.Robert DeNiro is nothing short of excellent as the flawed Pat Sr, and Jacki Weaver is nicely understated. Even the skilled ensemble of supporting players (including Anupam Kher as Pat's committed shrink) hits all the right notes. But the film, of course, belongs to its fine leads, who never miss a beat. Bradley Cooper, always a likable presence on screen, is a revelation here, underlining his funny, moving performance with just the right hint of pain. Jennifer Lawrence, all of 22 don't forget, lights up the screen as the deeply complex, rude, foul-mouthed and yet incredibly vulnerable heroine. Together they're electric, and just watching them spar is one of the great joys this film offers.Silver Linings Playbook, under its bittersweet exterior, explores themes of family, second chances, and notions of what is ""normal"" in the world. Relying on humor – often dark humor – to tell what is eventually an upbeat, feel-good story, the film quickly finds a place in your heart and stays with you long after you've left the cinema.I'm going with eight ratings , and I strongly recommend that you don't miss Silver Linings Playbook. You'll come out with a goofy grin plastered on your face!",8

4 July 2013,A silver lining.,"This is an amazing movie, with amazing actors. I like the whole story, even not being fan to this kind of movies. The story of two characters who meet and create an amazing relationship, passing through a lot of situations. Two persons with ""mental illnesses"" that made this movie amazing.

Things that i have to say?.

Yes, Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent work, a perfect representation of her character ""Tiffany"", doing one of the better roles that she have ever made. In fact, she won an Oscar by this movie. She was so lovely, and gave to tiffany a personal touch.

Bradley Cooper, WOW, excellent job, this dude made that Pat was a charming character, full of little things that made him give to the movie that special thing. EXCELSIOR.

The movie leave a good message, there always will be a silver lining.",10
21 February 2014,Tour d' Force for Lawrence and Cooper,"Unfortunately for Bradley Cooper, Daniel Day Lewis was virtually unbeatable for his portrayal of Lincoln. Otherwise, I think he could well have walked away with his first Best Actor Academy Award. He was singularly most outstanding, as was his co-star Jennifer Lawrence. Beyond those two, the entire cast was just tremendous. It was the best role I've seen Robert DeNiro play in years. The film was a roller coaster of emotions...anger, humor, despair, elation, etc. Welcome to the bipolar world. I thought the director did a splendid job of thoughtfully exposing bi-polarism and how it can affect those who suffer from it and their families. This is a film that stirs your emotions...in a variety of ways. And, isn't that the goal of filmmakers...to move you. SLP gets a 10 for zapping a plethora of emotions in me. A truly unforgettable film, bravo!

24 December 2019,Worst movie I've ever seen.,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",1
17 July 2023,Resplendent!,"I have viewed this film since it's release probably 10 times. It has such richness and brokenness all intertwined that leads to a warm gorgeous conclusion. I relate personally to this film and understand it thoroughly. People are broken, people are doing their best every day to find love, to find wholeness and this film shows the pieces it takes to get life back on track and together. ALL of the actors are excellent and so genuine. What a believable real life story. I can almost imagine me being a side player in this down to earth family story. Thank you for this film, it has enriched my life!

11 June 2022,The Unconventional Pick -Me-Up,"Silver Linings Playbook is an unconventionally romantic drama that explores the dance of mental illness and how 'broken' people can heal each other with patience and grace.

Cooper, Lawrence, and DeNiro's performances are quite wonderful. Not only does it show the ups and downs of mental illness, but the how the parents battle seeing their children struggling through life. It's almost refreshing to see parents supporting their children unconditionally, as unfortunate as that sentiment is.

The delicate balance in tone thorough the movie is impeccable. The script and chemistry between characters stands out as witty and charismatic. Someone going through a difficult time in friendship, mental illness, and/or love can find comfort in this movie as these flawed characters who have a lot of love to give. It reminds me to give myself grace, always.

2 September 2014,Surprisingly amazing,"It's gonna be tough trying to put into words how much I loved this movie, but here goes.

'Silver Linings Playbook' was one of the best and most refreshing movies I have seen in a long time. When it first came out, I didn't know too much about/ wasn't that interested, but I am so glad I decided to finally watch it. It has such a great,real story. Bradley Cooper was immensely likable in this movie, and Jennifer Lawrence put everything she had into this role. The dialogue, writing, and overall mood are incredible. It perfectly blended comedy, romance, and drama to make it one of my new favorite movie. Outstanding supporting cast including Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker.I have never been a fan of his, but he was great in this movie. I had such a great time watching this movie, and you should definitely check it out too!

4 February 2013,Deserves all the praise in the world,"Rarely have I felt this good after watching a film. Silver Linings Playbook is a meticulously crafted piece of cinema that celebrates life, love and trying to find your place in the world, with all the struggles and imperfections that come along the way. The narrative is dead simple: Pat (Bradley Cooper) is trying to get his life back on track after he has been in a mental institution for 8 months. He has been sent there after he caught his wife cheating on him and assaulted the man she was sleeping with. Pat has finally returned home and has set his sight on becoming a better person and winning his ex back. All goes according to his plan, but then Tiffany comes into his life, a troubled young girl who has issues of her own. Pat soon discovers that Tiffany play an important role in his quest to find his love again.

What makes this movie so special is its cast. Everyone is phenomenal, no exceptions. Jennifer Lawrence gives the performance of a lifetime in the role of Tiffany. I was already impressed with her acting after seeing Winter's Bone in 2010, but her acting in Silver Linings Playbook solidifies her as the promise of a new generation. It has been a while since I have been this impressed by an actress in a leading role. She inhabits the character of Tiffany and makes it her own. She is a delight to look at, but her talents as an actress even outdo physical appearance. Tiffany is brutally honest, outspoken and rarely takes no for an answer. She struggles with the fact that she's bipolar and she recognises her shortcomings in Pat, who is dealing with the same mental disability. The chemistry between Pat and Tiffany is what makes this movie so great. They are not easy to identify with, but I couldn't help rooting for them from the very beginning.

Bradley Cooper is equally amazing. I must admit that I wasn't fully aware of his acting potential before this film. I always liked him, but now he's an actor that I will watch a film for. He shines in this role. The chemistry between Pat and Tiffany takes center stage, but the stellar performances by Jacki Weaver and -especially- Robert De Niro deserve credit as Pat's parents who are trying their best to take care of their son while dealing with their own issues. It's great to see De Niro perform again as the great actor that he is, it has been a while. I found his obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles and the OCD little rituals that he has come up with to be a highlight of the film.

Silver Linings Playbook is far greater than the sum of its parts. A large part of this is thanks to the superb directing by David O. Russell. He gives all the characters enough room to develop. This film is also brilliantly written, with sharp and oftentimes funny dialogue with a sense of humour that feels a little out of place at moments, but is heartfelt and genuine at the same time. Everything just works here. The lighting, the cinematography, the music, everything falls into its right place. The editing deserves another separate compliment. Silver Linings Playbook is fantastically shot, but even better put together. Longer shots trade place with fast snapshots that gives this movie a very unique sense pacing. This movie just flows. Nothing is superfluous, everything scene matters here.

It's hard for me to express how much I love this film. No movie is perfect in my view, but Silver Linings Playbook comes very, very close. Above all, this movie sends a very clear and positive message: at the end of the day she are all a bunch of nutjobs who are doing their best to make the absolute best for themselves in this life. This film reminded me once again why I love watching movies in the first place and I can see myself watching this movie time and time again and never get bored of it.",10
4 April 2021,**Incredibly-well made movie & acting,"I finally got a chance to see this movie, 9-years after it was released -- and WOW did it move me! I finally 'get' Jennifer Lawrence, she's 100% smoldering hot. Her ability to transcend on screen is electric. And it makes perfect sense she won an Academy Award for her performance which I also just learned just now, an incredibly skilled performance.

The story, actors, direction, cinematography, music...takes you for quite a ride. Having heavy-hitters RD and BC doing what makes them so great also makes this movie a grand-slam. I wish I'd seen this movie when it first came out, but maybe in a way it's better I didn't see it til now, who knows. Overall a totally incredible movie and just have to say thank you to every single person who made it happen, it's a fantastic creation in every way.

10 March 2013,My favorite film I've seen in years.,"My best friend who is a female in her 30's and my 22 year old little brother are both bipolar. Watching not just Pat struggle with his disorder but everyone who is in Pat's life also struggle with how to deal with it definitely hit me close to home. The presentation was so true and real that it resonated with me, the way you sometimes hear veterans talk about a perfectly done a war movie. This film captures the struggles that go along with loving someone who is affected by mental illness. You're not just watching these characters live their lives but you find yourself completely filled with empathy as if you just received an adrenaline shot. Having watched my little brother throw out relationships with people over the years, I found myself rooting for both Pat and Tiffany in a way that I almost never get caught up in modern movies. Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Chris Tucker are all absolutely perfect. I recommend this film to anyone from any walk of life but you especially have to see it if you have anyone in your life that you love who wrestles with mental illness. I haven't FELT a movie like this in years.

15 November 2022,Recommended movie for people who are looking for HOPE,"Right thing at right time is what requires. This movie could be that thing for people who needed it. Positive attitude and working towards silver lining will change the course of destiny. There are few things we have to notice there is a supporting family required for making progress through tough time. Who still believes in them like his father did. He bet everything for that belief. It sounds stupid for normal people . Imagine yourself in pat play. Seeing some one is trusting whole life on him. That makes the person become good to better and best. Be kind . Its a must watch movie by everyone (Based on age recommended)

26 December 2013,A film that mirrored my own life as a fellow Bipolar sufferer.,"Silver Linings Playbook I watched over the 2013 Christmas holiday period with my Dad, Mum and Brother at home on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, UK. What can I say about this film, as a 37 year old sufferer of Bipolar Disorder, Type 1? (There are several different varieties of the condition, as it's very complex to diagnose and treat):

Really EXCELLENT, ENGAGING, THOUGHT-PROVOKING stuff! This film made me laugh and made me cry. I really loved it and the main character in the film playing 'Mr. Bipolar', mirrors my own experiences wonderfully!

Thank-you to all the cast and crew for such a great film, which I hope will break down the stigma, misunderstanding and suffering that still surrounds the condition. As a mental health activist and a person who is 'together and well' now after a rather rocky, yet deeply insightful roller-coaster ride, thank-you for such a great movie! I really do recommend it to fellow film-goers and especially Bipolars. Enjoy! :)",9
3 January 2013,Thank You David O. Russell!!!,"i decided to read this book while i was waiting for it to come to a city near me. It turned out that this movie came out in November and opened here in Fort Worth Texas on new years... an unbelievably long wait. Anyway, this book was great! and they changed so much to make it fit for the screens, that i was so satisfied! it gives you way to compare the same story. The chemistry on screen was fantastic, and Jennifer Lawrence has been amazing in everything she has ever been in. THE BEST NON-TEENEY BOPPER COMEDY MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!! My 11 year old brother even loved it and went home quoting it.(this movie should not be rated R)

2 May 2014,Absolutely enjoyable,"Silver Linings Playbook is supposed to be a 2012 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by David O. Russell. It starts out like a real exhausting story - working with therapy cases all day, it's not what I usually look for in evening entertainment. but since the film stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and Julia Stiles I wanted to see what they'd come up with.

Well, they created the funnest dancing scene in movie history for sure, especially when there are real life strong thighs of JLaw are grabbed by real life-like clumsy amateur dancer Bradley whose little wriggly bum was also fun to watch. Bradley and Jennifer, well done for creating a scene where we all can say: that's us. Wonderfully done.

There's crazy in all of us anyhow. The film's really sensitive directing made the movie very real, a story about people we know, a story about ourselves.

23 January 2013,Awesome Movie - A Must Watch,"I'm not really a great movie critic, but I like to think that I can appreciate the differences in styles of directing, especially how the movie is projected to the viewer.

I don't really go for the classic rom-com, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play exceptional roles in this one, in fact the whole cast do. From start to finish you're intrigued as to how the movie will play out, each step of the way you feel more drawn to the characters and the acting really pulls you in to the emotions that such individuals would be feeling.

Honestly, my opinion is you must go and watch this. Yes there are 'cheesy' moments and it does follow the similar theme that any romantic comedy would follow, but with more subtlety (especially with the comedy).

I have a medical background and I assure you that Bradley Cooper really nails the role right on the head.

10/10 is maybe too much to award, but that's my opinion. You start with confusion and intrigue, you follow through with laughter and then you end with a slight tear of joy. What more could you want.",10

11 January 2013,Surprisingly good,"I can be a bit of a tough critic when it comes to movies; And really, I have to admit the only reason I saw this was because I really wanted to see a movie and, well, De Niro. It is a really good movie though, one that I would recommend to almost anyone who asked.

I get tired of movies about romance that are focused on the teasing, the bickering, the conflict of the two characters before ultimately, the admittance of love. (usually followed by the overdone sex scene) But this movie didn't involve a whole lot of that, and I think Cooper and Lawrence both did surprisingly well in their portrayal of people suffering of mental illness. I myself have (am) suffered (suffering) from mental illness, and to say the least, it's really, really, really difficult to live with. I've been really down lately, and I saw this movie on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. It lifted my spirits though. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but you know, it's entertaining, heartfelt, and above all, realistic.

10 February 2013,Decent film compromised by miscasting Jennifer Lawrence,"Some good dialog and a decent film in my opinion, but casting a 23 year old woman who looks like she is 18 as a match against Bradley Cooper really didn't work for me. Hollywood's obsession with female youth and beauty over quality and credibility went too far this time. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress but I just think she was terribly miscast for this role. I just couldn't buy their relationship and consequently a rating of 5 as opposed to a 7. Also a tiny bit cheesy at times and predictably ""Hollywood"". But again, decent movie overall, some hidden gems in there, well executed except for the big flaw listed above.

21 March 2013,Immensely enjoyable,"Immensely enjoyable from start to finish. Wonderful acting by actors who all of perfect for the roles they play and are all a joy to watch.

The dialogue is at times funny, at others moving and thought provoking. It doesn't attempt to take itself or the subject matter too seriously but is very effective with its message. It's an easy to watch movie rather than a medical lecture so if you want the latter, there are probably better forums. The characters are easy to relate to and the charm of people striving to overcome personal hurdles is present throughout. Perhaps the hurdles are lower than in real life as the characters are all deeply attractive on many levels but the desire and struggle to look beyond negativity resonates in a world far too often presented negatively by the media and people echoing the media. There may be better endings and less predictable story lines but the movie had won well before the finish. There are overtones of another great film 'A beautiful mind' but this is less taxing to watch and any film featuring the enigmatic Tiffany is likely to be successful.

With such a well crafted movie, it is no surprise the sound track is excellent. It never dominates and yet occasionally stands out. Brilliant films tend not to have sequels but I'll be eagerly awaiting the next films featuring the people involved with this one.",10
6 December 2013,Pretty corny and boring,"This movie is an overrated joke so I gave it 4, had not it been overrated it deserves a 6. What good is there: first half, touch of mental institution, the actresses playing, parent - adult kid with problems communication. Although nothing strong or shocking happens the potential of creating some good film mojo is not bad since there is a guy who is released from the mental hospital, has a unstable behaviour/condition that makes others give him conditions on which he should behave (boring therapy) so although being free, he is still there in a cage making his clever plans. Unfortunately this institution- medication- illusionary behavior restrains x obsession relationships are not used fully nor enough for the whole movie. The rest is predictably boring. It revolves around too much dialogues. There is a silly investment/sport-supporting superstition babbling with a backing of some Rocky Balboa training for a love dance that will of course make the love come done. Strangely, the main characters in the movie are clearly very intelligent and well educated people which does not add credibility. Nuff.

24 November 2012,"Just a delightful film for those of us with bipolar disorder or depression, or the family members we can't help but bring along into our messy lives.","First of all, Bradley Cooper has blown my mind. He is SO good as Pat, so vulnerable and sweet, if also a little neurotic, anxious, and obsessive. When he speaks to his therapist and he says something about he has always known he wasn't quite right, and you can hear the palpable relief in his voice. It is so relatable to those of us who have been there, suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness, knowing something was wrong with us but not knowing what. To finally figure it out, it is a relief of epic proportions, because finally you know that the healing process can start.

Robert Deniro gives a wonderful performance as Pat's father, who suffers from anger issues and is a bit OCD. He has never felt close to his son, but he is trying in this film, and whats more, we can see he is trying. They have a brief tender moment which brought tears to my eyes, as he tries to talk to his son about wanting to help him, wanting to spend time with him. It is moving and just a great Dinero scene.

Jennifer Lawrence is great, playing Tiffany, a tough but vulnerable woman whose husband has been killed and lost her job from sleeping her way around the office, the way she deals with her depression. Lonely,and one of those people who likes to help others but wakes up in the morning realizing she's gotten nothing in return, she thinks she finds a kindred spirit in Pat portrayed best in a great scene around a dining room table having dinner with Tiffany's sister, Veronica (played by Julia Stiles) where she and Pat get into talking about all the meds they've been on and how they make them feel, much to the discomfort of Veronica and her husband.

I don't want to say too much more, as it really is a wonderful film that should be experienced in the flow. Its funny, painful, and a romantic comedy of profound meaning. If you want to see any Holiday Romance film, this is the one to see.",9
2 June 2014,Man with mental health problems who tries to reinvent himself and control his illness,"Basically Pat (Bradley Cooper) comes home to live with his parents after 8 months in mental hospital to try and reinvent himself to get his estranged wife back. Along the way he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who helps him in more ways than he ever imagined.

One of my favorite movies now. Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both have great performances. And obviously there is Robert De Niro who is always great. Bradley and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and their age difference in real life is completely forgotten because of this. The movie is so realistic in the sense that I wouldn't call it a comedy, or drama or really anything like that; It has it all. The drama is obviously shown through all the struggles that the main characters especially Pat and his family go through and I think most people can relate to it on different levels and in different ways. The comedy comes through the realism of it. It's not a ""comedy"" in the sense that if you want a mindless funny movie, but in an everyday realistic kind of funny. I have to also say the Bradley coopers performance is just outstanding in this. It was as if he wasn't acting, it was that great where you really do believe he is that character and forget he's acting. I loved that by just looking at his face and especially his eyes all of his emotions were right there for you to see and feel with him. That was what for me made me really connect and feel attached to his character.",10
29 August 2016,A Decent Film Hurt by Condescion,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",5

18 November 2012,Doesen't Disappoint,"Let me start by saying i haven't read the book so i cant say how true it stays to the source material but what can i say is that David O Russell has made a fantastic film with some real great performances not just from his leads but his supporting cast, De Niro shines as the father figure with a few of his own ticks, Jacki Weaver plays her role as the mother stuck between father and son, Jon Ortiz is hilarious as Pat's best friend, but the bigggest surprise has to come from Chris Tucker as Pats fellow mental patient Danny. Jen Lawrence was superb and and Bradley Cooper was just as good if not better.

Also the soundtrack kicked ass, kudos to David O Russell.

11 April 2013,"A lovable, rare find in realistic genre film.","I love this film, directed by David O' Russell, in particularly because it casts the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence as the plain-spoken, cut-to-the-chase heroine, Tiffany. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, the person who's story the film is centered around. I don't usually like Bradley Cooper, I hated him in The Hangover, and I don't think many other films have done him much justice, but, in Silver Linings Playbook he seems to really engage with the persona of his character and gives a brilliant acting performance.

Pat is definitely not the hero of typical romantic comedies, the ones where the male character saves the day and they always live happily, this comedy is a little different with reference to the drama of the psychological aspects of the film. A family element is brought together by none other than Robert De Niro, who plays Pat's father brilliantly. The family has problems too, but have one thing in common, they are all obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles, which football is seen as a sort of bonding time, but, there are some engaging emotional scenes between father and son.

Cooper and Lawrence's on-screen chemistry is so cool and the two are lovable together, constantly throwing insults, and they are not awkward with one another at any point, just brutally honest, this could have been a different story had any other actors or actresses taken their parts. Again, I think Silver Linings Playbook is enjoyable but sentimental, not at all cheesy, but an exemplary representation of a twenty-first century relationship. An exceptional film!",10
9 March 2013,"so emotional, makes you feel bipolar when you watch it !!!","Im in love with this movie. The movie has a great plot about mental problems and depressions stuff , this is what the couple deal with. This is such a nice﻿ way of dealing with such a serious problem like depression, I loved this move, it makes you feel ""normal"" in your ""abnormality""

Great movie﻿ mixed with humor and drama. Jennifer Lawrence acted well,surely she deserves an Oscar.

Best movie of the year!!!

17 January 2013,"Fantastic, Deserves an Oscar.","This film is my new favourite film. On paper it shouldn't work, but oh no.... It works so well!

This mixture of emotion and comedy in this film is done to perfection, there are a lot of laugh out loud parts, and just as many parts where you really feel for the characters. This film flows perfectly, considering it is about the touchy and sometimes confusing of mental illness, it is very easy to relate the the characters and put yourself in their shoes.

Bradley cooper 100% deserves an Oscar for this film. He was amazing, his acting was the best I have ever seen, he really understood his role in this film and took it to a higher level than his usual comedic roles.

Jennifer Lawrence has already won a Golden Globes for this film and deserves to be a big competitor for the Oscar for her acting.

Overall a fantastic film, I really hope it does well in the Oscars.

30 May 2021,So underrated!! It's brilliant on so many levels!,"This movie is superb. I've watched this many times at different stages of my life & it always resonates with me. Absolutely love all the characters & every actor who portrayed those characters, great cast. It's funny, moving & deals with some serious issues but all in a tone that keeps the movie light, which itself is a fine art.

I guess in many ways we either are Pat (both knowingly/unknowingly) or know a Pat, probably more so during this pandemic. I've always liked Tiffany's character but after having rewatched it last night, I have even more compassion & admiration for her.

I REALLY don't know how this isn't rated higher on IMDB. I feel like a lot of people didn't really' 'get it'. It's 8+ for sure.

24 February 2013,A Perfect Film,"I love this film. It has a silver lining for everyone in every place. You can find yourself in this film. You can find pieces in characters that you have. I cried when Pat Sr. talk to Pat in his bed and Pat has attacks. I laughed with dance and game scenes. This is a beautiful film for every time. Jennifer and Bradley has such a chemistry. I love them. Jennifer is so talented and beautiful actress. Bradley also has a gift. He can be anybody that he wanted to be. I watched it twice and when DVD comes out I'll buy it. Definitely. I hope , in this Oscar night, Silver Linings Playbook leaves red carpet with 8 Oscars. I just love this film. Thank you for this gorgeous film. Thank you so much.

3 February 2013,best movie in a long time,"The movie started a bit dark and I was expecting some disturbing story but after a first minute the movie flourished into the best developed scenario I have seen in ages.It is sad,it is funny,it shows the deepest emotions and disturbances of one living with mental disease but also makes you feel warmth of the family, friendship,trust....

The main character,played by lovely Bradley Cooper is built in such an extraordinary way that you connect with him instantly trusting him so much.By the end you start to love all the characters for being so real,honest and funny at times.

The best thing is: it shows that when someone trusts in you,give you a hand,takes care of you,listens to you.. you feel safe and strong,and even here Pat(Bradley C.)starts breading again,living again and most importantly loving again.In this way he is able to fight the disease.

I enjoyed this movie so much and would definitely recommend it!

Cheers!:)",10
13 January 2013,What everyone needs once in a while.,"Before I go on to say what I thought of the movie, I must address that I went in to see this after I had read the book. If you are of that group this review may speak to you more than to others. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it to you all.

The movie was very good. The screenplay was very up to date with what a good movie should have. The pace of the movie and the mood of the movie was very up beat and would entertain today's audiences. I really like the adapted story. I would say it was an alternate to what I was expecting, but I was not disappointed at all. The performance given by Cooper and Lawrence was amazing and that is truly what made this movie a treat to watch.

Now I will contrast this a little with the book so for those who are going to see this will not be caught off guard. The story in the movie (other than for some major plot points) did not correspond with the book at all. The book had a much more serious tone to it. For example there was a grim veil around Pat in the book because in the book he is in a much more serious and mal-adaptive condition than in the movie. Along with many character adaptations, the story in the movie has 40% mutability with the story in the novel.

That being said, I recommend both the book and the novel VERY MUCH. The book is almost completely different and is a good story as well but a little more grim, which makes the silver lining all the more satisfying.",7
19 January 2014,Cada Cabeza Es Un Mundo,"Cada cabeza es un mundo -- Each head is a world -- . Just finished watching this film, literally 20 minutes ago . I shut down my computer while the credits were still running, threw on my clothes and walked with Purpose on Playoff, football Sunday to a local watering hole with Wifi, to sip on a beer while I write down my thoughts on this fantastic film. The story of the short circuiting of human emotions painted in this film has filled me with adrenaline. My heart is beating as if I just sprinted, my hands are trembling a little. The spectrum of scenarios that triggered emotional meltdowns in nearly every character of this great cast could not have been more authentic. Delusional relationships, a song, gambling, obsessiveness, inappropriateness, hyperactivity, loss, sex, love, arrogance, zero filter.

There was an innocence in the flow of the dialogue. There was understanding, suspicion, awkwardness. Whether good or bad, the consequences related to the perception or delusion of not being understood struck me like a 90 mile hour fast ball in the ribs.

No one goes through life without being misunderstood on occasion, the problem is that some folks live with the delusion of being misunderstood all the time. The surfacing of not being in control of your feelings is what makes living interesting and of course dangerous as well.

Who doesn't want to be consumed with love?? I can understand breaking in to a fight for my brother. I'd show, or at least try ( I'd probably fail ) at controlling my hormones for a dancing partner as fine as Jennifer Lawrence for a woman I still Love. I can understand trying to control my hormones for that woman I still Love and the delusion of her loving me back. A woman, my wife of nearly a decade who I caught cheating on me with a colleague, in my house, with our wedding song playing in the back-ground. I'd confuse my fathers love for his very apparent obsessive compulsiveness. I'd understand my friends obsession with his haircut and his rain man knowledge of the Law. My other buddies over-worked, loveless marriage that hates his job. A marriage with an overbearing controlling wife, newly minted with a baby, a mortgage. The stress and craziness, on the cusp of having a nervous breakdown you hear in the rants he only reveals to you.

This cast was colorful. Chris Tucker and John Ortiz gave wonderful performances ! Robert Di Nero was completely effortless and his partner in crime Paul Herman, one of my favorite Soprano characters was a perfect compliment. Jackie Weaver was great. Bradley Cooper has earned a fan for life.

Clearly, really, really loved this film !

TOMA!",8
16 August 2019,Plain film with inaccurate portrayal of bipolar,"I feel like the only one who didn't fall in love with this movie. To me, it simply lacked luster. Additionally, I found the acting involved with being bipolar to be extremely inaccurate and it bothered me to have this often debilitating disorder portrayed in that way to the world. Cooper portrays the character as childish and, in my opinion, somewhat stupid. Everyone that I've ever met with bipolar has been extremely intelligent and adept, despite being on a rollercoaster of emotion. I think the acting just needed more research.

8 March 2013,Highly Recommend,"I won't give you a long drawn out summary of the movie - you can read other reviews or the actual summary on IMDb if you want that. However, I will say that even though I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence, I expected 'Silver Linings Playbook' to be just like all of the current mush - a fried egg completely raw on one side and burnt black on the other - over-driven, yet underdeveloped, marketed as a drama to hook viewers sick of what now qualifies as a classic chick-flick.

However, I was wrong, thank goodness. This is the movie that should be used as the playbook for all future romantic/drama films. They actually hold off on the sex scenes, instead of trying to fast track your attachment to them - developing the characters themselves and the relationships between the characters emotionally and psychologically. The issues addressed, how the characters handle them and how they are eventually resolved, for me, all echoed of real life silver linings. I am not going to say that you are going to walk away feeling like you've been rammed in the gut - you won't, because this isn't a 'demanding' movie, by any stretch of the imagination. But it is an echo, as if you yelled your life into a canyon, and something like your voice came back, except a bit more warbly and little less clear.

I was left with this lingering feeling of relief, as if the different complicated aspects of life are not so black and white, but at the same time, aren't so gray, either, as morality-mongers and Hollywood would have us believe.

I was sick of watching movies where the characters find true love in the first 20minutes of the film and then have sex as acknowledgment that this is their true love, all the while pretending it's just a fling and the sex meant nothing. I was sick of knowing that the the next 40minutes of the film would focus solely on those same characters running away from each other, while the meaningless (separate) drivel of their (individual) lives is portrayed, as if that would make them deeper to the audience, and and finally, ending up together because 'they just can't be apart', despite the fact that during the movie they learned absolutely nothing personal about each other (apart from sex).

If you are sick of this kind of over-done/under-done movie, then 'Silver Linings Playbook' is for you. Even if you aren't sick of such movies, 'Silver Linings Playbook'is still for you, because you will still love it and in fact, it may even serve as an eye-opener.",

The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",9
12 June 2013,You have to watch it to the end,"I'll admit that for a while, I really did not understand why everyone loved this movie so much. It was honestly a little tiresome at the start and I found myself quite confused about the incredible reaction it had gotten.

I think that to really understand this movie, you have to watch the entire thing because that's when it all sort of comes together and you see all the different layers more clearly.

I personally loved it. I thought it depicted the issues at hand very well. I know people who are bi-polar and honestly, the movie was pretty accurate. The acting is brilliant, and the characters are great. I would absolutely recommend this film, 9/10, it's fabulous.

3 March 2015,Beautiful,"This is not a predictable and boring romantic film,but it is so much more exciting.The performance by both Bradley Cooper(Pat) and Jennifer Lawrence(Tiffany) was amazing,the way they portrayed bipolar patients were spot on,Robert De Niro,was also great playing the father,his emotions felt real and his struggles looked real,in fact the whole movie didn't feel like a movie it could have easily been a real story.It teaches you that no matter how hard life is there will always be a silver lining. You also root for Pat and Tiffany to get together and you see them connecting even though they are very different yet possessing the same illness.In conclusion,the movie was well acted,the characters felt real and it was a very heart warming experience.

27 December 2018,"Okayish, I guess?","I didn't like this movie, also I didn't feel like I wasted my time. I guess that's alright sometimes. The four stars are mainly for the cast. Jennifer was absolutely gorgeous. Bradly Cooper was good. The story line felt somewhat flat to me. Except for big words being thrown once in a while I didn't really find anything catchy.

11 March 2013,if there was and 11 our of 10 this film got and 11,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

15 September 2021,How can i miss this long?,"Well actually it appears randomly on my suggestion movies to watch. Googling a lil bit and it showed great rating. My expectation was fulfilled, this is a great movie and i love to watch it from the beginning till the end. This movie, as a bonus, very good to watch for those who have the same condition as their real life motivation. The storyline was so smooth and exciting, and the characters were great, really doing their best in their role.

8 January 2013,Great Movie!!!,"In my opinion, this movie is this best movie of 2012. The acting was great. All of the characters seem to have such great chemistry with each other. I could not think of a better cast. This is both Jennifer Lawrence's and Bradley Cooper's best performance of their career. The veteran of the movie, Robert De Niro, delivered a great performance to add on to the great performances. Chris Tucker added some good comedy to the movie which any good drama movie needs. I was very pleased to see him back in a good movie. The story was superb. I read the book and the way they adapted the screenplay for a major motion picture could not have been better. I still thought that the book was amazing but there is no question that I prefer the movie version better. I recommend this to everyone that loves good movies and likes walking out of the movie theater with a smile on their face.

28 January 2013,"A comedic journey, into the sad world of mental disabilities where the characters personalities prove to be more interesting then the norm.","Great Movie, just incredible acting. I, during the first few minutes felt I was going bi-polar, I had to try to block out the chaos of the dialog. I was really entertained by the comedic flare, the chemistry of the actors, and the their struggles. Bradley Cooper is becoming a versatile actor, I'd like to see him try his hand at different accents, darker roles. Deniro, what can you say this guy is just a legend. I found it interesting to watch people with mental issues having a normal life, kind of an insight that they shouldn't be pushed away, they too are capable of the same things as all of us. You will laugh, you will love it. No spoilers here, go see it!!

15 June 2013,A new Fresh Rom Com,"It was one of the few movies, i have seen with such closeness to the real life. i must say that Bradley Cooper is now taking up impressive projects... recently saw his latest movie ""place beyond the pines"". He has flair in all genres like comedy, action and romance.

I really liked Jennifer Lawrence in this one, her character is mysterious but attractive, but i feel she deserved the Oscar more for ""winter's Bone"". good performances from Robert de niro(as always), Julia stiles, Anupam Kher and Chris tucker(long time since i have seen him :D)

it is a heart warming rom com which u can enjoy a lot.

10 June 2014,An intensely told human experience,"I will keep this short and sweet. This is a movie everyone should watch. I don't know how well it portrays bi-polarity, or other disorders, since I do not have one nor I know enough people with them to make up my mind. All I know about is movies, character and story. And this is a very intense study, of immensely deep multi-dimensional characters going through serious life problems that anyone, whether or not they suffer from mental illness and/or conditions, can relate to. It is complex but understandable, weird but relatable, and always compelling. Some of the best performances I've seen on screen in a while carry this great piece all the way to a surprisingly non-cheesy great ending.

16 February 2013,Real Love.. happens even before the first kiss,"Silver Linings Playbook is truly a wonderful movie. It indeed touches the heart, and portrays human emotion and bonding... in a simple yet brilliant and fascinating way. The chemistry between Pat and Tiffany is the centerpiece of this movie... which proves that forget sex..love can happen even before the 1st kiss. It may sound far-fetched... but the true love and bonding between 2 people.. sometimes can start in someplace other than physical attraction. Lovely movie! The importance of family and friends in life and not to mention the realistic portrayal of bipolar disorder is good show. Bradley cooper, Jennifer Lawrence,Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker... all have played their roles brilliantly. The Indian (of India) twist- role of Dr. Patel was a surprise, as we rarely get to see Indian characters and roles in mainstream Hollywood movie. All in all.. an awesome movie!

Not only was Di Niro enjoyable to watch but the Ensemble cast was in perfect sync and THANKFULLY Hathaway was NOT opposite B cooper, tho I was skeptical with Jennifer Lawrence. Pacing and dialog moved the story along in a smooth, intelligent and deliberate way. Something that I am happy to have been witness to....my point? I have not felt that about a movie in a long time. I was not just entertained, I witnessed something crafted well and was entertained at the same time. Rare. I was pleasantly intrigued to watch the whole thing unfold, made crazy work and enjoyed every single second of this movie. GO see this. REALLY.

26 May 2013,well done everyone...,"to the director David o'russell and/or editor, this is such a fantastic movie, so well done, story-telling, cinematography, chemistry, editing, can I say one thing that stood out to me, that I would have changed around...

90% of the movie builds up to the dance scene, but there wasn't enough of the dance scene, after all that build up, you could have done so many things there, if nothing else, let it go longer. I felt a little cheated out of something. IF you had to cut something out to do it, the cop scenes seemed unnecessary and like SNL skits. So I would have cut them out altogether.

once again, such an impressive effort.

7 July 2014,Needs more detail on portrayal of mental illness,"Silver Linings Playbook shows all the major characters to be suffering from a great range of mental illnesses which varies from Depression to OCD to Bi-polar disorder. These mental illnesses are depicted some-what accurately through the film but there are some flaws that I feel could have been addressed. The Characters who suffer depression are not shown to be suffering the same symptoms of depression that people in reality suffer from. The Characters do not have great slumps in mood, feel like the world is against them and then isolate themselves from family. If you watch carefully you will notice that the characters are always doing something during the film, they never isolate themselves from family. Being from a family with a history of depression and mental I feel that they are not portraying mental illnesses in enough detail that they could of.

22 January 2014,So funny,"One of my favorite movies of all times. I don't need crazy plot twists to enjoy a very funny, feel good movie with great chemistry and acting. I have not laughed this hard in years. We can all relate and wish our own quirks were so funny and witty. A+

I read other reviews about people babbling on and on about how mental health problems are not funny or this isn't really how bi-polar is or whatever. GET A LIFE!!! This is a pretend movie, we can say and do anything we want. We can say bi-polar gives you super powers and that's OKAY!

What a nice movie, could have done without the handful of F-bombs.... but it's hard to find movies these days that don't swear. Hate swearing with a passion.

5 May 2015,We've All Got Issues,"This film is a quirky drama with an underlying comedic tone throughout starring Bradley Cooper as Pat Solatano and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. Having been released from a brief stay at a psychiatric institution Pat moves in with his Parents in Philadelphia and he is bent on becoming a better person and staying rehabilitated - his primary motivation being to reconnect with his estranged wife who has a restraining order against him. Pat is determined to stay positive and look for the silver linings in his life despite many obstacles he faces in the wake of being incarcerated for beating a man nearly to death whom Pat caught his wife cheating with. Of the challenges he faces, the biggest ones are internal. Being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Pat experiences sudden changes in mood. The fact that he refuses to take his prescribed medication only serves to make the problem worse.

Pat is obsessed with winning back his wife and is chasing the carrot that everyone around him is certain he can't catch. Like Pat, everyone has their own problems, but believing that a happy ending is possible is the one thing we need to get what we want out of life and most of the time the main obstacle is ourselves. This is a driving theme throughout this film much akin to the film Good Will Hunting (Damon & Affleck, 1997) where we see a character that gets in his own way and doesn't see true happiness at first though it is right in front of him.

In Pat's quest for self-betterment and winning back his wife's heart he meets Tiffany, who he quickly learns is just as dysfunctional as he isif not more. This common thread initiates a friendship that allows them to help each other understand their issues and deal with them better. As time goes on we see the development of a crush that Tiffany has on Pat that does not appear to be reciprocated, yet a friendship has begun. Though an attraction exist on Pat's part, he must decide which relationship is an illusion and which one has the silver lining he is looking for.

Throughout the film we get acquainted with Pat's father, Pat Sr., and continue to get a deeper understanding of his love for the Philadelphia Eagles and his strong superstition. Pat Sr. is strongly convicted of the fact that his son is a good luck charm and consistently pressures Pat to watch the Eagles play under the guise of needing bonding time with his son. We see just how strong Pat Sr.'s superstition is when he begs Pat to watch the game with him at a time when Pat has a previous commitment with Tiffany, who is helping Pat become a more controlled person. Eventually, Pat Sr. learns that his superstition was an illusion and that even if had been real, he would have been lost a bet he hung his superstition on anyway.

This film shows us that we can be our own worst enemies. By believing that what we want is possible we can still end up with the result we want but a great deal of heartache can be avoided if we open our proverbial eyes and get out of our own way.",7
3 December 2015,Perfect recipe,"Silver Linings Playbook is a very unique romantic comedy-drama movie. The characters are very interesting that you can relate to them even though your personality is different. The movie is natural and bold. I love the flow of the story. It is very inspiring. I watched the movie three times, to say the least. It kinda change the way you see things. Their characters are perfectly imperfect. You will definitely fall in love with their characters. A beautiful mess. A must-watched movie for all. One of the romantic movies you will never forget. Excellent acting, excellent story. And I must say that it's difficult to see a romantic comedy-drama film that you will enjoy like this. I'm obsessed!

30 December 2012,Above average Dramedy,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",7

2 June 2017,Very real,"Hits very close to home. Cooper and Lawrence do a fantastic job of humanizing mental illness. You can feel how real it is to them. Almost to the point of feeling uncomfortable. Beautifully executed by the actors. The camera work is great as well. A little shaky at times, but the story line makes up for that.

24 March 2013,Plot problems. Why do the cops instantly turn up?,"What a great story. Diseased however, by the plot dictating the characters actions, instead of the plot manifesting from the characters. It really seemed like as soon as the main character did anything wrong, the police showed up. There seems to be a theme pattern in movies today that portray a character's wrong doing by immediately showing the punishment for the action. This falls short of realism and destroys the credibility of a what looked like a fantastic movie. I think it is possible that cops do not have to turn up every time something emotional happens. People can neutralism situations themselves. I found this very unreal and tarnished the movie.

31 October 2014,Very good,"Most people who gave a bad review probably never bet the sports books, never had a real relationship ptsd, never had a promiscuous girlfriend, never cross the normal line and went crazy themselves. I was able to relate and it brought out real connecting emotions the characters let out. Okay, the depiction of a bipolar person may not be what you are witnessing yourself, but scientist themselves haven't fully understand the disorder, how can you judge the validity of his. There are many forms of bipolar disorder, and let's put it at that. If you're giving the movie 1 star, what the hell are you looking for in a movie, Jesus Christ. It was enjoyable, it made me laugh, and I thought it was brilliant.

16 December 2017,Excellent film on the complicated relationships in ones life,"Silver Lining Playbook is a romantic comedy directed by David O. Russell, starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro. Cooper plays Pat Solantano, who was recently released from a mental facility. Where he was hospitalized after having a breakdown and losing his wife to an affair and then losing his job. The movie follows his story in re-claiming his life and finding his own kind of happiness. Along his journey he crosses paths with Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence who offers to help him with his estranged wife if he does something for her.

The complexity of human relationships is played out very well throughout this film. The father/son relationship Pat has with his father who is played by Robert DeNiro, with both of them trying to figure out how to handle their complicated relationship after Pat's breakdown and hospitalization. Tiffany and Pat's relationship is also a very interesting one. They are both dealing with a lot of loss and coming to grips with their own insecurities.

Camera angles were key in this film. The way it was shot really brought the viewer into these characters lives almost in the first person point of view. It seems the camera is going a long for the ride as another character within the film.

Silver Lining Playbook is an excellent film focusing on the relationships of the common man and something everyone can relate too.",9
15 February 2017,My experience,"I wonder how I missed this movie. It is an intense love story with

a melodramatic end.I could relate it to myself, as I am patient of Bipolar Disorder since last more than 4 years and is on medications. I can feel that a major part of it, is unrealistic. It has stressed on the Maniac aspect without thinking about Depressive phases when I used to just sit at one place, hanging my head and without having any interest in life. Those panic attacks and suicidal ideas should have been shown. Sometimes I used to run out of my house, to overcome a panic attack

11 October 2015,Lost in my mind,"For someone who wasn't even interested in seeing this movie to begin with, I ended up seeing it twice in theaters and setting a reminder to myself for when it was released on DVD. Such a humble movie that shows the disorders of the mind in a very effective way. The situation is brutal and honest, not to mention the brilliant performances of the cast: obviously Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence in particular. Being a fan of Bradley Cooper, it was amazing to see him in a role he's never done before and just absolutely nail it. Where was an Oscar for this role? He had a way of making the audience laugh with his no filter one liners about a disease that is, in reality, actually really serious. He made the character his own and didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence rightfully deserved her Oscar playing Tiffany. With her heartbreaking meltdowns and quotes that we can all sometimes relate to. It's not a confusing plot. It's people trying to move on and continue with normality in their lives despite their mental illnesses and other things that happen. It shows a real but funny look on how to deal with these certain circumstances that can have a stigma behind on why we sometimes just crack.",9
3 December 2019,Overrated,"I would say it's a movie overrated that tries to combine several parameters but is not very good in any of them. Nonetheless, the actors, the good tempo and finally his intentions, save him with a score other than average.

13 September 2023,Great performance by Bradley Cooper,"It took me a few years to watch this as I wasn't crazy about the premise of the movie. I am so glad I finally decided to give it a chance.

Jennifer Lawrence did a good job here, but Bradley Cooper was the star.! I wasn't a huge fan of his but this performance changed my mind. I'm very surprised that Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar and not Bradley Cooper. Like I said, Lawrence was very good, and the actors that played Cooper's parents were good too. I mean, it's Robert De Niro, of course he was awesome.

The movie does start out a little slow and the subject matter may be difficult for some viewers (slightly difficult). However, if you stick with it for about 20 minutes, it will be worth it.

24 September 2023,Tremendous display of great acting,"This is not a RomCom to me. Is a profound story of two troubled people and how them in a sometimes funny (but tragic like ludopathy) and loving social and family framework can overcome their fears and challenges. Very entertaining and creative set of events that are not as predictable as typical romcoms. Fantastic acting on leading and supporting roles. While Cooper is sometimes very Bradley Cooper he did an outstanding effort or ridding himself of himself and being the bipolar patient at the beginning of the movie. De Niro was not only very credible in his ludopath role but an endearing loving father at moments. Every facial expression of Jennifer Lawrence is to be closely followed as it gives huge proof of her public recognition as one of the best actors of this generation.

17 May 2021,This movie came up with a little strong beginning story,"This movie came up with a little strong beginning story and I felt like everyone was going crazy on everything but it's just a movie of two people who were in pain because of the previous broken love find each other in the darkness time of their lives and shared love. Everything happened before their dance in the competition were like no logical sense. The dance somehow connected it all and it ""make everything better again"". This is the second movie of David Russell that I watched after Joy (2015). I think when you watch his movie, you have to be patient.

7 May 2013,Not the book but still good!,"If you were like me and read the book before seeing the movie I'm sure you found yourself thinking, ""No!!! That's not what happens!"" during the course of the movie. After blocking out the book version this movie becomes a wonderful yet sad tale of two completely screwed up individuals. As much as I enjoyed the book there were so many parts that were way too drawn out. For once a movie included all the good parts that you would like more explained and let out or briefly touched on the parts you didn't care to know that much about. The very basic idea, characters and storyline of the book was written into a movie script which would be more accepted to audiences. It was nice to have parts you never expected and actually left you thinking if it would end the way the book did or not. One of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. Do yourself a favor and read the book as well if you haven't. If you haven't seen the movie read the book first and then see the movie.

30 January 2013,Amazing,"I think this movie will be a classic. I did not have high expectations going into it and I was so surprised. I think the people who didn't like this movie, either didn't get the message or maybe need to see it again to appreciate it. I thought the acting was fantastic from Robert De Niro all the way down to Chris Tucker with Jennifer Lawrence the best of all. I thought the first part of the movie was very slow and I found it a bit disturbing but once the second half kicks in, the first part takes on more meaning and it all comes together perfectly. It reaches Chick Flick status at the end but I can easily look past that. I have watched it a few times now with different people and it gets better each time! I have seen every other movie up for the Oscar this year and this movie blows them away, not even close. We are all entitled to our own opinions so give it a one star if you feel that is accurate (? some have) but this movie was worth every penny and in a day and age where 90% of the movies are not worth watching it was so refreshing to see this.

6 September 2013,Wow,"I have officially fallen in love with Bradley Cooper. And Jennifer gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Truly deserving of all the hype. This is a love story with a huge difference. It's not cheesy, you don't roll your eyes, not predictable, not trying hard to be something and failing. It is an awesome tale with different twists and turns, of love, heartbreak, life, moving on and a tale of how family is supposed to be...not perfect - just family. I cried, I chuckled and I was glad I decided to see this movie. If you see only one movie in your lifetime...this should be the one. Very well done. Every single one of the characters, you can identify with...well except maybe the cheating ex- wife. I can't say enough good about this movie. I honestly don't remember the last time I saw a movie as original as this.

Bravo to everyone involved in this movie from writer to producer to actors to crew. You have a standing ovation from me. :D

29 June 2013,Not my usual cup of coffee,"This movie was absolutely brilliant. I usually watch action/ adventure movies, so this movie isn't what you'd call my usual coffee. What spurred me to watch this movie was the great cast, and well, the great reviews it's been getting. It turns out, all the good reviews did not disappoint me.

This movie has meaning, has originality. And to be truly immersed in its goodness, one has to put himself in the character's shoes. I was truly surprised at how inspiring this movie was.

The plot was well written and the acting was magnificent. What else could you ask for in a movie right?

30 April 2013,Just wow,"I don't know where to begin. This movie is just breathtaking and refreshing. I was expecting nothing much and started to watch the movie with very little expectations. After 5 mins into the movie, I was blown away with the acting, scripting, directing.. I love this movie and I love to watch it again. Just wonderful screenplay and I would highly recommend this to anyone that appreciate true art of film. just go rent it out and watch it and may be this would be the best few dollars that you'll spend.

I was happy to see the parody of blind leading the blind and it's such a wonderful to see the characters developing thru out the movie. Just excellent.

19 May 2013,Silver Linings Playbook Review,"Silver Linings Playbook Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Bipolar OCD

Finally a movie that touches on what mental illness such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Bi-polar, and OCD looks and feels like.

Last week I attended a presentation by NAMI Stand Up Against Stigma is the National Alliance for Mental Illness statement for May Mental Health Awareness Month.

The first day Silver Lining came out was I think the same day. I really wasn't sure what the movie was about but as I watched it, I was overwhelmed with emotion as I yelled and cried out FINALLY a movie to help us with Mental Illness be understood and hopefully accepted back into society without prejudice.

Then on Saturday, I received my NAMI magazine and they have a full article about the movie. Wow someone is reaching out to me to push forward with my book because it is very timely and further illustrates what it is like to have PTSD, Conversion and Somatization disorders.

In Silver Linings Playbook: Movie Trailer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZLKfYQ_Wyo

Pat Solatano- a man with Bi-polar and PTSD.

The Movie illustrates:

The challenges of coming home after a hospital stay. How people in the small town react to him with prejudice and are terrified of him because they know what he did. Behaviors that are routine and comforting to Pat but are abnormal to others; example, wears a garbage bag while running because he sweats. How up and down emotions are high and lows, etc Shows how Pat's hearing is affected when he hears a song that isn't playing because of the trauma he experienced with his wife. Others with mental illness accept each other and can be the biggest help to overcome challenges. Society Non - Acceptance = Mental Illness Stigma

Peer to Peer Support = Acceptance, Encouragement, True Friendship

My book is very timely because I feel it gives readers another image of mental illness and what it means: Flashbacks in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Surviving the Flood does this very thing by describing in detail what it is like to have distressing flashbacks, body memories, sensitivity to sound, smell, touch, and leaving reality to go to the past as triggers arise in everyday tasks and environment. Also, how upsetting it is for a patient to have to accept medications when it is their only choice to control their diagnoses. It also illustrates in detail what therapy looks and feels like, as the little girl switches ego-states, while going through the process of healing. It also shows the transition from a hospital stay to home life and the judgment of people who know that you were in the hospital.

After reading this book, you will have a road map back to sanity while making new trusting relationships with people you chose to be a part of your healing journey.

Anyone affected by mental illness will be able utilize the steps in this book to assist loved ones in finding the path to their unique healing journey.

You will have gone through the entire healing process so if you experience a relapse or regression you will recover quickly reinforcing that you have control of your mental illness.

10 June 2013,Enjoyable movie that gives you a good laugh and a strangely beautiful love story.,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8
1 February 2013,Great movie!,"Awesome movie! There's no other way to describe it! May be is me but I felt much identified with the character of Pat: it describes very well how a person (a men or a women the sex really doesn't matter: this is one of those rare situations when men and women behave the same way) use to act when someone that you were in love doesn't love you anymore: you hold on to all the good memories and try to win her love back, the problem is that, often, no matter what you do, you can't. This movie is about the process of realize that no matter what you do, sometimes there's nothing you can do. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are astonishing, De Niro is as good as usual. The soundtrack is also very good.

9 February 2013,Great,"I saw that the movie received a number of award nominations so I thought I should see it. I did not know what it was about but loved it. It was funny and choked me up in the end. Difficult topic to write about but executed very well.

I thought Bradley Cooper was an average actor having seen him in easier roles although after seeing him in this I thought he earned the nomination for best actor and I hope he receives the award.

Jennifer Lawrence played her role to perfection, very impressive. Having not seen much of her previously I didn't have any expectation. She was very impressive. Very deserving of her nomination.

Well done!

22 January 2014,One of the best depictions of Bipolar I've ever seen,"This movie depicted very realistically my own experience with bipolar, it was honest and true to the illness it avoided stereotypes, and I found it very relatable. After watching and purchasing on HD, I am officially in love with Jennifer Lawrence, watch it I'm sure you will be too. Bradley Cooper seems to turn every movie he's in to gold with the ""Midas Touch"". Robert Deniro gave a great performance depicting the father who doesn't quite no how to handle his ""koo koo"" son. Chris Tucker was great rambling away, I swear I've met people like his character. Watch it it really is an awesome movie. This movie despite its desperate subject will warm your heart and give you a Silver Lining of your own.

1 December 2013,Perfect,"I adore this film, my absolute favourite and definitely my go-to film for any occasion! I can pretty much always find something in a film that I don't like or wish I could change but this is an exception! Starring my two favourite actors this film brings me to tears every time, and believe me when I say I've seen it more times than I can count! I'm not sure what makes me love Silver Linings Playbook so much but I just cannot get enough of it!

Not that I have ever been in a similar position as either Pat (Bradley Cooper) or Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) but I feel that Silver Linings Playbook is hugely relatable and that it could lift the spirits of anyone in the same position as Pat or Tiffany. I find the plot heartwarming and it makes me sob every time! I'm not going to give the story away but what the whole film leads up to towards the end was comedic, heart stopping and relieving!

Bradley Cooper has done an outstanding job of playing Pat and I really believed the character. It baffles me how he didn't receive an Oscar for his performance. Jennifer Lawrence however did receive an Oscar which she completely deserved and I congratulate her! The characters in Silver Linings were played by a variety of amazing actors such as Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker, John Ortiz and many more, all with excellent performances! This film has made me very excited for the upcoming films Bradley and Jennifer have worked together on!

I'm more of an action film kind of girl and I usually really dislike lovey dovey girly films but this changed my opinion on them completely! I wish I had criticism but honestly can't think of anything they should have changed, neither can I think of a similar film, one of a kind! I can't wait to read the book to see how they compare! I don't think David O'Russell or anyone else could have done a better job! Grab a box of tissues and watch this film now! My all time favourite film!",10

8 February 2013,A wonderful film,"This film was wonderful, really uplifting and one of my top feel-good films of the year! A must see. The chemistry between the 2 leads is amazing. You also have to wonder if Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper pushed for this film to be made so that they could star opposite each other as they did in Limitless.

I think this film sheds light on what's happening in the world today - many people are struggling with depression on a daily basis and the world is slowly coming to terms with the fact that this is a problem - and that the people struggling are in need of care and understanding.

They can get better and this film shows that.

24 February 2013,Touches only special people,"it is like one of the great books, that you can't really put it down without leaving a true drop of tears on the other side of its cover, ...... amazing emotional creators behind that movie ........... a must watch !

the writer, the director and the musicians behind that movie just made a brilliant orchestra, you can feel that those people are all pushing their feelings at every detail, every sound, motion, touch, and scene in that movie.

maybe it is a story of many people who are getting out from the darkest situation of their life, and was able finally to rise up and bring their happy Sundays back,

a very deeeeeeeep psychological and emotional work out there

I can't imagine this is taking all that bad reviews !! it is like that i watched another movie or what , maybe somethings inside that movie only touched special lucky kind of people i am one of them !",10
27 April 2013,pretty darnn good,"Hey people nice to read my review,

the story begins a bit of retarded, I most certainly didn't like it, but after the first struggle of about 25 minutes, it's worth watching, (Unfortunately, you do need to see the first few minutes)

At the beginning... Kind of foolish to begin that way, but still, you see a young man who is completely screwed up (pardon the language) during the film he will be helped by Tiffany (a role by Jennifer Lawrence), who (in the end of it all) will help him get sane. It's also a movie about dance, and in case you're wondering, no this is not the kind of movie like Grace or dirty dancing and similar. The dance idea is working for our dear friend to make him sane again. Also Julia stiles is in this movie (sorry, I'm a succor for good looking woman, and in this case, I do have the idea that she should be more in the movie, at this moment, I do believe she has a kind of by-roll) Nevertheless, In the ending... (hussh this one up, would you?) they get together, they curl up together (Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper) on a lounge chair, and who in Gods name wouldn't want to curl up with Jennifer Lawrence?

It's quite a nice production, though the first few parts are quite.. well boring, but it's nice to view though.

Regards,

3 February 2014,Silver Linings Playbook 10/10,"I had to watch this movie i just knew it.. I started to get obsessed to Jennifer Lawrence after Hunger Games , so i knew this was going to be the perfect movie.. And i was right.. well at least for me , i love watching romantic comedies and i keep believing that love is out there for all of us so yeah.. Thats one of the lessons that this movie gave us, don't lie to your heart and your own feelings, say what you want to say to that person , don't ever be afraid because if she / he feels the same you would never knew it.. like they say risk it for the biscuit.. And has we all know nobody is perfect , and that is what makes love so beautiful , because he fall in love for other person because of their imperfections , their mistakes , because they make our bad days became in awesome ones.. I love this movie and i have seen it like 3 , 4 times really really touching..

If you are reading this and you haven't watched it yet, go for it , its a piece of art.

11 January 2013,Best Picture:Silver Linings Playbook,"And the winner is""Silver Linings Playbook!""

Let me tell you whythe stars could be aligned and by coincidence (NOT!) the film will finally role out in wide release this weekend after a run of building, building, and not quite yet, building to NOW!

Growing up my childhood idols were Muhammed Ali and Pete Rose (Same age btw as my dad) and at 46 my idol is the legendary film conquistador Mr. Harvey Weinstein; he loves film like fat kids love cake & ice cream and his track record of acquiring the right film at the right time is beyond legendary.

The most appreciative reaction in the foreign film category this morning was the announcement of The Weinstein Company's recent acquisition (immediately after its screening at AFI in November) Norway's ""Kon-Tiki."" They were denied a double nomination with the remarkably inexplicable (but, this is the Academy we're talking about) slight of ""The Intouchables"" a popular and universally loved tale of both ends of the financial spectrum.

But along comes ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and it's Harvey magic time! The film received the Grand Slam of nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Actress,) making it the first film to do so since 1981's ""Reds.""

Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Jackie Weaver and David O. Russell all signed up long ago with the game plan being be the underdog. A film not just chock full of stars but of ""actors"" and some of the best in the business at that and if you combined the receipts of Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Chris Tucker you'd have people in the seats because this trifecta of the future paired with the anchors of DeNiro and Weaver will do more for the veteran duo than vice-versa.

Solid formula and TWC strategy and boom! Eight nominations; for a comedy? A drama? A dramedy? No, eight nominations for the best winnable TWC type film. Herr Weinstein spun his magic for ""Shakespeare in Love"" (Directed by John Madden who's latest project ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was snubbed loudly today) and that film beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture in 1998, remember? Was it a comedy? A drama? A dramedy? No, it was the foundation for a slew of Oscars yet to come and a recipe no one else has been able to master. The film is directed by David O. Russell and has been nominated to the big dance his last two times out with 2010's ""The Fighter"" and today for ""SLP"" and like ""The Fighter"" his cast was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Actor and had wins for both Melissa Leo (defeating fellow cast mate Amy Adams) and Christian Bale. So, TWC gets to work their magic because no major blockbusters stand in their way. They can manipulate in a Tom Sawyer kind of way convincing a movie with 5 A-Listers is the underdog film and should be considered for Best Picture and hopefully somewhere in the Amblin Entertainment/Dreamworks office someone in their machine will work day and night for the next six weeks to not let a repeat of 1998 happen to ""Lincoln"" what ""Shakespeare in Love"" did to ""Saving Private Ryan;"" and I think King Harvey has Mr. Spielberg right where he wants him; Again!

9 June 2013,Review of Silver Linings Playbook,"This movie is excellent and every one should know. Bradley Cooper gave his best performance ever ( it was amazing how an actor from the hangover could be so good he definitely shouldn't have lost the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis but that just my opinion). Jennifer Lawrence do I even have to explain what an amazing job just amazing and De Niro was great to I thought that Jacki Weaver could use some work.

Now lets get into the review of the film I started off with Pat Solitano (Cooper) leaving the mental institution and moving in with his parents (De Niro and Weaver), the movie is already giving this warm pleasant vibe so we now it's gonna be good. It's a beautiful, cute, warm, and funny film about a mentally ill man finding his way in a weird way with some obstacles as he does not want to leave is original wife Nicki and he meets tiffany who has some depression issues. Everyone should see this film. Definitely one of 2012s best movies.

23 July 2013,Amazing movie for all,"I usually do not write reviews, but this film is really great. I loved it from beginning to end. The acting is really great as well. I love movies and this is a movie you can watch on a double date with guys and girls. I feel it is exceptional. It did not underestimate the audience and I didn't feel that they dumbed down the story at all. Highly recommend this to anyone, even guys that usually do not watch this kind of movie. Every character was great and fun to watch. Now that I am writing the review I feel it should probably be higher rated. It truly was a great film. I would recommend this to anyone, not just people who watch romance.

6 March 2015,The perfect example of (what should have been) a best picture.,"Siver Linings Playbook is one of the best examples of (what should have been) a best picture. Amazing performances that truly feel like real life (Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, Anupam Kher, and the entire cast). And a subtle but yet very powerful direction that guides us non invasively throughout the movie. It is a story that is felt and not just told. A story that reveals our very realistic crazy relationships, our rage, passion, fear and judgement. Silver Linings Playbook is about love that is present in all our flawed families within our personal intricacies that ends up being perfectly imperfect. It's a true ""best picture"".

29 December 2013,Lost potential,"The film tells an absolutely great love story. That someone from a psychiatric comes to a better person to win back his true love is exciting and interesting. Great idea! But sad is the implementation.

First of all, the cast is chosen wrong. Bradley Cooper does not manage to embody the role seriously. Jennifer Lawrence is good, but had already delivered better performance. Robert De Niro is absolutely great, but unfortunately goes completely under.

The narrative also knows for weak points. How to develop Tiffany love to Pat, why is unclear what Pat Nikki whispers at the end and why Tiffany knows all of a sudden the football results ... The list could be continued.

In the end the movie with a better cast and a sophisticated script could have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, lost a lot of potential.",7
13 September 2016,One of the most amazing movies of all time.,"Before I start to watch the movie I thought it was just another romantic comedy about unrealistic illusions about love. I had already imagined the whole movie and how it should end based on the uncountable romantic comedies I've seen.

So guess what. Silver Linings Playbook not only did it live up to my expectations but it actually became my favorite movie. It was so much different than the classic love at first sight thing. An AMAZING Bradley Cooper facing life with bipolar disorder and having decided to keep a positive and most of all OPTIMISTIC attitude to life from now on and a STUNNING Jennifer Lawrence having to mourn for her husband at such an early age but still managing to pull herself together is just an incredible thing to watch.

All in all, this movie is such an entertaining, romantic, inspirational and most of all OPTIMISTIC movie to watch. I hardly recommend it to anyone, I'm sure that either you are or you are not a fan of this kind of movies you are gonna love it as much as I did - so much that I felt the need to tell to everyone to go and watch this now. You are going to be even more excited as the minutes pass by. Trust me.",10

25 October 2018,Unbelievably disappointing,"Inaccurate portrayals of everything to do with mental health issues (ex: Where oh where is the depression in BIPOLAR DEPRESSION), therapy (ex: Therapists do NOT just trip their patients' triggers in the damned LOBBY of there practice), & the mental health system/institutions (ex: Mental health facilities, particularly those housing violent patients CANNOT just be walked out of by patients - especially 2x!!!!).

Cramming false narratives & too easy plot points into a stereotypical Hollywood romance PLOT does not a great movie make!

Ugh, I need to go rinse my mouth out from this sour taste from my mouth.

29 April 2016,feel good movie,"This was a feel good movie. Love both main characters and the roles they played. I expected to like the film because I had heard it was very good and very deep, plus I like romantic comedies. In this case, my expectations for the film were met so they did not influence my reaction in a negative way. Occasionally though, some movies will be so hyped up that my expectations are unlikely to be met and this sometimes causes me to be overly critical of the film and give it a bad review. This is one of the reasons I try not to see previews or trailers for movies before I watch them. I felt it was important to connect with both main characters so that you could understand what they had gone through in their lives and realize how they were trying to overcome those obstacles, and thus understand and enjoy the story line of the movie. I recommend seeing the film.

31 August 2016,"Typical ""mentally-diseased boy meets mentally-diseased girl"" story.","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",7

12 December 2012,Slightly Disappointed,"I finished reading the book, got up from my chair and drove to the theater to see the movie. That was a mistake. It's true, you should never read the book before you see the movie. I liked the book so much more than the movie, and felt a little disappointed. I have to say here that I am a life long resident of the suburbs of Philadelphia and am an Eagles fan, not quite as obsessed a fan as the family in the movie, but I do occasionally wear my Eagles jersey on game day, and they drive me crazy just as they did the family in the movie. I related to the author's story on every level. DeNiro's portrayal of the father was completely opposite to the father in the book, where I felt, Pat, the main character, was longing for his wife's love as well as his father's something the movie just didn't capture. As I read, I kept feeling I just wanted to hug him. Of course, I felt the same way about Bradley Cooper, but for very different reasons....oh, those blue eyes! He probably does deserve an Oscar nomination. The street scenes had an unreal quality about them I didn't like, kind of like the movie was filmed on a movie set. The best scene was the dance contest. I would recommend the film.",7

30 March 2014,Another Movie that Glorifies Screwed up Hollywood Values,"This film had talented actors and a compelling story, but it ultimately validates the very dysfunction that caused such unhappiness in these characters to begin with. The film suggests that it's no big deal to forge a letter, lie to people you love to coerce them into doing what you want, and more. (Avoiding spoilers) In fact, it glorifies dysfunction and then suggests that more dysfunction is the way to ""heal"" and/or help a person. Huh?

How come the characters are perfectly fine with being lied to and betrayed? (They would likely have greater difficulty trusting others than most.) Answer? Screwed up Hollywood values. How sad that cultural rot is the cornerstone of pop culture today, and the measure of what is considered to be ""cool."" This image of America is what is exported to the rest of the world.

Hopefully, kids will find out through experience, (Since the media teaches them the opposite) that honesty, accountability and personal responsibility aren't old-fashioned, but fundamental to living a happy and fulfilled life.",6
18 November 2014,Surprisingly Great,"I watched this movie tonight as part of my ongoing effort to whittle down my long list of movies and shows on my Netflix Instant Queue. Now, I am really fond of movies that show serious character development throughout the movie. And I really like characters I can identify with.

Early in the movie I realized that there were virtually no characters that I could really connect with. And also, it seemed as if it was stuck in a rut during much of the first hour. I have a hard time with characters that seem to be distracted and disjointed as the main character seemed to be.

I have to admit that I was tempted to cut and run as I sometimes do.

But I hung in there. And pretty much when I thought that this thing wouldn't turn around, it did. It did everything I needed it to do to grab my attention and to lure me in with the promise of a real plot that was going somewhere instead of a slow and predictable descent into failure.

I'm glad I did hang in because this movie delivered. Very happy to have seen this engrossing movie. This is my first review ever.",8
13 July 2023,Ruined a great book,"This movie is the altered decrepit version of a great book. I understand the need to omit or make some minor changes for the big screen. This though, is outright trash. I wish someone would redo this and make it the way the book was written. The characters are similar but the dialogue, timeline and details that made the book a I read in two days are all realigned and deformed. Instead of a three course meal, they put all the food in a blender and asked people to eat it. The casting of DeNiro did not allow them to keep him with the limited dialogue that exists in the book. The ending was so far removed and not just in the detail of the performance, the feel and reason they danced. How they reconnected. The painful and awkward communication between Pat and Nikki. The more I watched the more aggravated I became. An outright crime. If you haven't read the book but watched this movie, please go read it.

5 October 2014,Nice find!,"OK, a few years ago I went to see a movie at the cinema almost by chance and it was ""The Fighter."" I was like: Yeah, Christian Bale is great, the style is interesting, good film and a director to watch. Time passes, I hear more of him. A movie comes with the following shitty title in France:""happiness therapy"", and a cover that inspires a bad romantic comedy. And then, out this month, the new David O Russell (american hustle), the guy who made the fighter and happiness therapy ... I'm like ah what ?? So I deign to watch this movie called Silver linings play-book originally and I have one of the finest cinematic surprise in a long time. Beautiful moment, engaging story carried by the authentic camera of O Russell. It takes the codes of romantic comedy and waltzed just enough to give personality and depth found out this script. Good cast, Bradley Cooper builds on success for a while. Really nice discovery, and I am now ready for the new David O Russell!

25 February 2013,an interesting and unique romance / drama,"Things that were well done: 1. Well acted by all involved. no bad performances and as you have probably heard the two leads (ecspecially Jennifer Lawrence) were very impressive. 2. Well directed...the way the film was shot had no flaws unlike some movies that fail to capture emotion where it does exist, instead it makes you believe what is happening is real because it doesn't try to overpower the content or hide behind it, just let's it do it's thing. 3. Works well as a romance; i would say this movie is one of the better romances out there, but that is because there aren't very many good ones, mostly inaccesible to guys entirely, but this one works from both the perspectives and has a decent emotional payout at the end and you realise that most of the screen time was working towards it.

Things that were badly done: 1. Badly written. in my opinion the only problem with this film comes out of it's attempt at showing the lives of people with certain mental instability. it fails at this not because of the dialog or actual events that occur, but rather it does not succeed in taking us inside the mind of the lead (Bradley Cooper) because it doesn't show enough flashbacks/ weird thoughts he would be thinking instead of listening to other people's voices... but also it doesn't take the route of trying to be objective and shooting as if it was a documentary that you can either choose to take a side in or not, because it doesn't film from angles and zoom levels that suggest being impartial to the characters.

a better than average film with a unique storyline that is worth watching just for the great performances but also for a decent romantic pay out at the end.

14 June 2013,"'Silver Linings' Won't Win, But It Should","I remember in 1998 when As Good As It Gets went up against Titanic for the Best Picture Oscar. I remember thinking that it was no contest. Titanic was just too big and too awesome (yeah, I liked it). But what film have I watched at least once a year since? Here's a hint: Nobody dies in it.

As Good As It Gets continues to charm me as an example of how a village of dysfunctional but honest people can not only save each other, but drastically improve each other's lives.

Enter Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper as the recently released mental patient willing himself to overcome his bi-polar disorder without medication and finding aid from an unlikely mentor (Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone)) recovering from her own grief-driven nymphomania. Most self-help books would tell us that this match is an absolute disaster waiting to happen, but David O. Russell's writing and direction actually sell us on how it can work.

This starts with a scene fairly early on in the film. Pat (Cooper) and Tiffany (Lawrence) openly compare notes on psyche meds to the horror of their unhappily married hosts Ronnie (John Ortiz) and Veronica (Julia Stiles). This is an odd conversation but it is played with such charm that we are with them. Their gleeful candor tells us they're okay. The embarrassed hosts on the other side of the table, however, are not.

This theme repeats throughout the film. Pat and Tiffany do ""weird"" things or tell their thoughts too openly, loudly or at the wrong time of night. But one thing comes through in every scene from these characters: honesty, honesty, honesty. And we love them for it.

We love them because we see our own family on the screen and we think of just how fun it would be to have a Pat or Tiffany come over and hurl open the closets in our own house, just as long as we're not there or it's not about anything we don't want said, but yeah we kinda want it. Don't we? Over the past few weeks, we've been listening to platitudes from cultural and political leaders about how we need to have a ""serious conversation"" about mental illness in this country. That's about how far it's gone. In truth, we'd rather yell about guns or violent movies instead of looking at a significant portion of our population who are tired of having to hide, take their meds, and not do anything ""unusual"" so they can avoid strange looks and do their best to fit into ""normal"" society.

Silver Linings offers an alternate view. While it is ambivalent about meds (as it should be, because lets face it: meds, for many, can be a bridge over troubled waters), it is very clear about one thing. What we view as illness might very well be a magnificent personality making its way to the surface. And what we view as normal or functional might be completely dysfunctional and destructive.

The key, the film seems to argue, is community.

Americans like to feel good about themselves and this year's Oscar lineup gives us plenty to feel good about. We enjoy watching our country abolish slavery, rescue hostages and assassinate a monster. Those things are easy for us to enjoy because there is a clear right from wrong, especially after the hindsight of history. Silver Linings Playbook, however, challenges us to reconsider what we think of as weird, scary or dysfunctional and it calls into question our ""normal"" way of treating those we consider to be ""abnormal"".",8

6 March 2014,Amazing,"I am very picky of what films I will watch.

After the trailer I was not quite sure about this film.

But at the beginning the story had my full attention.

With enthusiasm I delved into it.

Although the ending was a bit predictable, It was still enjoyable to watch.

With composure I classify this movie as on of my favorites and I highly recommend it to all I can.

This Movie is the proof, that the New Continent still has the potential to do a really good and high quality motion picture.

It is full do really good actors.

And I am happy for that.

So Buy or Rent this amazing story.

30 March 2014,"fantastic, perfect, and everithing else","this movie is the best thing that has happened recently in my life I think this is the best film I've ever looked at and everything is perfect. plot:Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr., caring Dolores Solatano discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr., from a Maryland mental health institution after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to him beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions, Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the ""silver linings"" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so .

31 August 2013,Brilliant film about Love,"I love this film. I love the actors and the script and everything about. I read the book before I watched it on DVD. I think that the DVD is more like a development more than recreating the book, bits are changed and things are different (last names mostly). But I love how it was made and the emotion put into it. I love the characters and the development. I like how that differed to the book. I really enjoyed the film and I consider it one of my favourite. I like the quotes from it and how it teaches you that you can have silver linings and faith in them. Even though sometimes there can be a harsh reality. I think the tag line or the other names also make a good point to it. Happiness Therapy, true to the word because for them and for the viewer it is.

31 January 2013,Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal! 10/10,"I saw this film in November and still cannot stop thinking about it. It is absolutely beautiful. Its heartbreaking, hilarious, romantic, and moving all at the same time. It is a romantic comedy and would recommend anyone to go see it. If you like dramatic comedies (like the Descendants, or Little Miss Sunshine) then you will love this movie. It deserves all the awards it is receiving. Amazing performances from the entire cast!! Bradley Cooper does an amazing job playing Pat as he goes through life after coming out of a mental institution. Jennifer Lawrence is flawless as the young widow Tiffany who also has a past of her own but tries to embrace it. I am a big fan of her other films (The poker house, winters bone, like crazy and the hunger games.) Robert De Niro, and Jacki Weaver star as Pats parents who try to help and understand him throughout the film. The entire cast has such great chemistry and it really shows. If you like Dramatic comedies and/or films where many characters have problems (as some people say ""messed up characters"" this is the film for you!! 10/10

10 February 2013,Very fun and not a typical romance film.,"I'm just going to go with the fact that as a men I almost never want to see comedy romance movies, this movie is fun and also talks about the troubled people with certain psychiatric problems, even they can have relationships on their very own way. Is amazing, fun, entertaining and makes you think about your life a bit, how you can help yourself with your problems, life, deal with them and even how to relieve them. Just add the fact the psychiatric problems, add the comedy, minus the common family and social behavior.

I would recommend it to watch it if you don't like the so common romance comedy with a boring drama just before the end.

11 August 2015,It's a good one.,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8

10 October 2013,Oustanding Silver Lining,"Silver Linings Playbook is the best movie that I have seen in a long, long time. My Mother was afflicted with this disorder and struggled with it everyday of my life until she passed away at 28 years old, in my opinion directly from this disorder. The movie could not have been more accurate in describing ones daily life struggling with this disease.

Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both deserved their Oscar nominations and both should have won. This is by far Bradley Cooper's best acting of his career as is Jennifer's. To put the two together was nothing more than genius. The chemistry between the two is phenomenal.

I don't remember the last time that I loved a movie so much until this one. It is a must see for everyone. You won't regret seeing this one at all.

23 March 2013,A must see movie,"We watched this movie after seeing it won the best actress award in Oscar. We were not disappointed at all, awesome movie, definitely worth watching, no big stunts, just amazing story and acting. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is so amazing. And I also have to admit that the actor's acting is also amazing and he actually has much more scenes in the movie, he also deserves an Oscar! Those kind of movies always amaze me, like Notebook, A beautiful mind etc. Just watch it I would say and you will see what is a Oscar winner looks like. I will wrap up here. Thanks. I do not know why IMDb puts a minimum 10 lines requirement here, it does not make any sense.

7 February 2013,"Great performances that make us believe it's not a ""chick flick""","With promising names in the Cast list, such as Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, it was bound to be above average.

After seeing them in less emotional and more manly acts, you might get the impression that putting an unusual face to a romantic story will make it more appealing. Well, it does! Less shooting, less jumping off buildings, but a little more drama and it's out there! No matter the cause, no matter the effect, no matter the purpose, no matter the meaning it twinkles around a boy and a girl, it builds up to a series of events which seem to have a logic. Accepting this logic is entirely up to the viewer's mood. The story itself tries to swing you through different emotions, but it only works if you decide to embrace it from the start!

This might have been, as some may say, De Niro's last chance to shine. And it was brilliant.",8
22 January 2013,great film,"movie we are getting this from http://ashare.me/files/vSaGh1358848168.html

Tiffany is another version of the tough bartender and college drop-out in Russell's The Fighter who sets out to rescue the failing boxer from the family that is destroying him. Both are familiar characters in Hollywood comedies, but the fundamentally sensible Tiffany is given a rare depth and pathos by Jennifer Lawrence. She bonds in a complex way with Pat by giving him a pejorative, one-minute summary of Lord of the Flies before throwing it out into the street. This echoes a literally shattering scene earlier on when Pat reads the high school syllabus his wife is currently teaching, is driven crazy by the wilful pessimism of the end of Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and throws the book through a closed window. Perhaps the message of this strand of the narrative is to carry on with the medication but be careful what you read. The great strength of Russell's writing and direction resides in the way he consistently manages to retain a comic tone without losing touch with the characters' pains and anxieties. There are numerous scenes that in other hands would be as excruciatingly embarrassing on the screen as they would be in real life: a row in a diner, for instance, that spills out into the street on Halloween night and involves a crowd in fancy dress outside a cinema. But Russell involves us so closely in what we're watching that we become emotional participants. And that's because he cares for these people in a wholly unpatronising fashion",7
5 December 2022,Unrealistic,"The first thing about this film which is horrible is the dialogue. They are contastaly talking over each other and it's hard to focus on the story. And they are constantly shouting. Like they are always being proved wrong. A film which is meant to be about mental illness becomes a cheesy cringsy lovestory.

And the way they portraits mental illness is very unrealistic. Like the writer never actually meet anyone with bipolar at all.

And though most of the film they zoom in on Jennifer Lawrance ass which is very irritating. And Pats mom has this really wierd staring eyes all the time.

This is probably one of the worst films I have seen.

28 January 2013,I was getting desperate,"I had to watch so many shitty movies, and especially ""romantic/drama comedies"" this last few years to get to this one. It's hope. That there will always people who dare working hard and take risks. Great cast, great directing, great story.

It's just a movie, but then it's life too. The story of how I met my girl friend would meet the script properly. You can bring such change in your life and in the life of others I can tell you. Life is about learning to live with those around you. To find balance. This is what this movie is about, among other things. And it's good to see it narrated in such a powerful and joyful way. Thank you.

I would need a lot of cursing to write this review properly. But then I have to contain myself. Just go see it.

1 February 2013,"Lots of laughs, but even more heart","I really enjoyed this quirky film more than I expected. I would not call it a comedy but my wife and I laughed a lot a the odd behavior of almost all the characters. More laughs from the audience than most so-called comedies. Yet, it's a very emotional story and may invoke a tear or two.

A common thread makes you think ""What makes someone 'crazy' in our culture when so many things that we consider normal (like extreme football fandom or superstition) actually seem odd when you really think about it.

Great performances all around, and it was just a well- put together movie. No slow time, and the crisp 2 hours flew by. Based on the interactions I am sure that there was much more greatness on the cutting room floor, but I especially appreciate the discipline it takes to edit when so many films these days drag on. This film actually won out among other options at the theater for me today because it was shorter. Great film!",10

11 February 2013,Surprisingly Beautiful,"Despite having a stellar cast I did not have much expectation from this movie after watching the trailer, but I was in for a surprise. The movie starts slowly but builds on a faster pace as it progresses. As the storyline moves ahead you tend to relate to the characters better and they grow on you. The movie does have its dull moments but the well executed roles by the lead cast tend to hold your interest. The story is about love, faith, family and bouncing back in life. It is about reassertion and the belief that one should never give up on life, because it can surprise you every single day. The movie strengthens your belief in yourself and tells you that no matter what the difficulty you face, there's always a Silver Lining!

16 February 2013,Best romantic comedy of the past few years,"To be honest, if I hear ""romantic comedy"", I'm already afraid that I look forward to a one and a half hour of awkward laughter, and will have to look around every once and then to check whether I have to laugh or cry in that specific moment.

Well, I have to say, that this time I was very disappointed in my prejudice, because this is an excellent film! Whether you want to watch in cinema with your girlfriend, or just download it and watch it alone, it's a perfect choice! Robert De Niro is one of the few actors who got old with dignity and plays perfect in completely different role than he is used to. And Jennifer Lawrence... she is just a (Sex) Goddes, about every man is dreaming of...

10 March 2013,It's this very combination of all these together which has made this movie special for me,"I loved the movie. It's been ages since the last time I had been so much touched by a movie like this. It's not the gorgeous act of the main characters of the film which makes it touching for me. It's not because the score is composed by my favorite composer Danny Elfman. It's not because all the beautiful little moments of love and care of which you would see a lot in the movie. It's not because all those slight yet weird kind of comedy all through the scenes. It's not even about the beautiful rhythm of a normal romantic life you could give a bipolar back. It's this very combination of all these together which has made this movie special for me. I'm touched and Hope you Find it Touching too.

11 April 2013,Great acting; bad plot,"I guess I'm probably missing something, because I heard several people saying that this film was brilliant and unmissable but I really don't understand why. All of the acting is amazing, I can't knock points for that because this film changed my mind about Jennifer Lawrence, however I really think it's been hyped too much and rated too highly for what it is. I find it somewhat insulting to great films which are rated around the 8.0 that this film got anywhere near them because, despite the brilliant acting and the somewhat well done character building, it wasn't all that it's built up to be. Most of the film is slow and it feels twice as long as it actually is which makes it quite hard to sit though. The subplot with Pat's father feels unnecessary. In fact most of the film feels as if it didn't need to be there.

Worth watching, but don't expect too much.

7 November 2013,Wonderful,"The Best Film I Have Ever Seen. Thank You David O. Russell. The Film is Wonderful. It Deserves better rating. The Actors ( Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro ) Are Awesome. Thanks To All The Crew , they made a real film. Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. It Really Deserves the Oscar. This was a good movie and I'm pretty sure it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I like this type of movies.

6 January 2014,Subtle genius,"I was completely caught of guard by this film. I came in with average expectations and believed that it would try to ride mostly on the names of two popular actors. However I was thrilled to be wrong and find both parts perfectly cast. The theme of life is tough and look for the light doesn't feel so cliché, as well the message to realize what is right in front of you is nicely shown. Both characters were flawed enough that any outcome is in the realm of reason. So at the end of the film no ending would have had a huge shock value. This movie was well written and the characters and their portrayal really brought this movie to a very real place and I wouldn't have changed a thing.

24 February 2014,Silver Linings Playbook,"Whether or not you know it, this is REAL life for families of adult children with emotional issues. I thought it was spot on at the same time entertaining. DeNiro's portrayal of Pat's father gave you introspect of why he turned out (genetics) the way he did....A beautiful production that gives hope to all who deal with this on a daily basis. Hopefully all our troubled family members will have a silver lining.... I LOVED this movie...You can see the mother at all times not wanting to say too much out of fear of the reaction both by her husband and her son. I found this to be so honest and revealing. It was heartwarming to see Pat find someone who understood his emotions and was willing to incorporate them into her already chaotic existence. I found this movie to be explosive with real life situations and emotions and I could watch it again and again....

25 June 2014,.,"The Silver Linings Playbook focuses on many types of mental illness and some characteristics that sign mental illness. The protagonist Pat has a number of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, bipolar and possibly ADHD. In the film this is depicted very well and seems very realistic but still makes it light hearted. Other characters such as Pat's friend/ love interest Tiffany also ha signs of mental illness and has been on all the medications that are for people with things such as depression but has not actually been diagnosed with a mental illness as far as we know although she may have grief due to the passing of her husband.

19 July 2014,Masterful,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.

But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.

Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.

Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.

It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",10

1 December 2014,Pleasantly Surprised,"I didn't know what to expect the first time I watched this movie and admittedly I had to watch it again to really get it... Now every time I see it on the movie channels I turn it on. It's such a good movie in so many ways. Shows how real life is for people with issues, which if you're being honest is a lot of people, nobody is perfect. I think it shows that there is hope for everyone to find some happiness in their lives. The acting in this movie is phenomenal. Jennifer Lawrence is smart, cynical and hilarious. Bradley cooper does an amazing job of showing the ups and downs of mental illness. This is a great example of a dysfunctional functioning family. I don't care how cheesy it is, but I just love a happy ending, and this one makes me feel good. It gets an A+ in my book :)

23 January 2015,"There should be a word to describe this, none I have thought do justice to the experience","This was the best movie I almost walked away from even though it began perfectly to tell the story. The characters are in my heart. What a great book that must have been to read.

I identified with the often quirky, dysfunctional family that through the power of love & spirit in us, balance each other, push, pull, forgive & see the silver linings in life & each other.

My eyes were wet & I was made stronger seeing this movie. I love this family.

Well made in every respect. Kudos to all involved with the making of this movie, especially the author of the book. Brilliant cast. You should all be proud.

23 July 2015,It gets better and better,"This movie has come to be one of my absolute favorites. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence make a perfect combo in this mildly twisted and awesome movie!

I rented this movie knowing nothing about it, saw it on the shelf and just picked it. As I had no expectations of it what so ever when I started watching it I admit, I was a bit sceptical. The dialogs, the camera angles... everything about this movie was so different from movies I had previously seen. But, as the story went on (I would not give up on this movie despite how I felt in the beginning), it just got better and better!

I have recommended this movie to all of my friends and have also, by now, seen it myself about ten or fifteen times since Februari 2015 (and I'm not even embarrassed about that), which is basically the best way for me to explain how good this movie is to me.

18 January 2016,Good Ending,"It is a great movie. Started off strangely, and ended with romantically.

Hats off to the Actress, Actor and all other crews been apart of this better film.

You know what! In life, this is what happening in most of their stories. In such situation, you have to understand the intensity, mind set of the person you are dealing with.

Even though you are in love with someone who is not around, at least give some credit to the person from your heart.

Honestly, I never had girl friend. It's just my comment which is the way I love.

Best Regards,

Tariq,

24 April 2016,the one&only masterpiece of love,"Basically I like the love-story movie the least in many genres of the film. But in spite of all the prejudices I have in these kinds of movie, I happened to watch this and I'm very grateful that I got that chance. It is a story about two normal(not normal in terms of the views from the world) people become perfectly complete by making love each other. What makes this movie greater is that it shows the main character's defects throughly and, of course, also shows that how they get overcome from it. Everybody in this world tends to hide their weakness to other people, but in this movie, they don't. 'Excelsior', I hope everyone who read this eventually experience the best moment as Pat did.

17 October 2016,Everyone should watch this,"This film prompted me to sign up and write this review as I was really moved by it. Creating an impacting, engaging, enlightening and entertaining film which centres around mental health is not easy. It was achieved and excelled by Silver Linings Playbook. This unique narrative flows exceptionally well, with unexpected turns that draw you deeper into both the story and the inner workings of each character. I appreciate films that are able to do all of this, while conveying very important messages, such as the line of what determines 'crazy' running through every one of us. There were many fine details that went into how this was achieved and I was left seeing all the parallels in my own life and family. If you are looking for an intelligent film that elegantly conveys insight into mental health and takes you on a journey that will leave you feeling positive, emotive and moved; look no further.
