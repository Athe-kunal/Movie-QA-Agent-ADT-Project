15 January 2004,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

Look closer.

29 May 2000,An Oscar well deserved.,"This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.

I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.

Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.

While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.

If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.

My Rating: 10/10",10
14 August 2001,An American Masterpiece,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.

Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.

The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.

The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.

If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.

22 March 2000,"A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice. Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes. Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.

It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.

With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film. The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.

The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors. The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.

An amazing movie, strongly recommended. 10/10",10
26 February 2000,A little masterpiece...,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.

Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.

The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.

Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.

Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.

Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.

This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.",10
29 November 2003,Beautiful...,"Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.

Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.

As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.

The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms - not that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).

The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.

Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.

All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.",10
12 November 2007,Close To Perfection,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.

5 November 1999,One of my faves of the year...simply great.,"This movie was a joy to watch. I didn't know what to expect when I came into it. I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.

Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"". He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed. His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well. I think they both should be nominated.

The support cast is also spectacular. Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.

This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition. When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty. Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life. He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.

The music in this film is also very well chosen. There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.

The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go. I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.

See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.

This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.

My Rating (1 - 10): 10",10
7 July 2001,a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.

A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.

Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",10

When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

14 December 1999,Far and away the best film of the year,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster. I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price. Boy was I happy when I left. Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times. This film is virtually perfect. The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes). What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done. In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography. With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about. In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc... Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all. Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty. This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year. What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?",10

22 June 2021,Powerful,"""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already.""

""American Beauty"" is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America (there are indications that it is Chicago), where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents, as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter.

A patriarchal family, ruled by a conservative father, a military man, moves next door to them. While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor's weird son, and his wife has an affair at work, he, not so secretly, obsessively falls for his daughter's girlfriend.

This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric, while in fact, it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives. Admittedly, most only in their heads, and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better. But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent, but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply.

A strong, well-written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes. ""American Beauty"" did not fail in that field either. The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier, but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role. A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho, slimy and sexy, a villain and a victim. Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester's actions, and yet, Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer, rather than repulsion and disgust.

Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman, trapped in a long-extinguished marriage. A woman who, with the last twitches of common sense, tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her.

There is also Thora Birch, an unpopular teen, escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley, as well as the insecure Mena Suvari, who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader. Her transformation from ""Lolita"" that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film, where she is half-naked, trembling under Spacey, does not deserve to remain unmentioned. Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey's, Mena's performance is unfairly underrated. And last but not least, Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears.

For me, the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester's fantasies, in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie. And of course, the ending is a bit over-the-top, but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength.

The film won five Oscars for best picture, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and Spacey's performance, and was also nominated for editing, music, and leading female role. Each well deserved.

19 April 2022,Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia,"Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie.

12 November 2007,Look Closer...,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie.",10
13 June 2010,"Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.

What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
20 December 2003,"A decent movie, but not great - highly overrated","I'm not sure why so many people raved about this movie. It was entertaining and the acting was pretty good. Kevin Spacey was, as always, fantastic. In fact, I found that to be one of the sore spots in the movie. Spacey was so good that the other acting - albeit okay - simply didn't measure up.

Still ... it's worth a see. But I don't think I'd shell out to buy it. Once was enough.

11 August 2006,American Ugly,"Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife.

26 January 2002,"""I Know I Didn't Always Feel This ... Sedated.""","Hmmm ... Let's just take a cool, objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed ""American Beauty"". ""Haunting."" ""Riveting."" ""Brilliant."" ""More than meets the eye."" ""Uplifitng."" ""Never contrived."" ""By far the best I have ever seen."" ""Makes you think."" ""Exceptional."" ""Never gives stereotypes."" ""Classic masterpiece."" ""Movies don't get any better than this.""

And that list is by no means exhaustive. Now let's contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching.

Lester Burnham is Suburban Man. An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family, he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home, and failing to indulge his own individuality. When two key events coincide (the loss of his job and the dawning of a 'crush' on his daughter's friend) Lester is suddenly free to ""beat his drum"", slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self.

Yes, that's right, yet another dull, cliche-ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America. All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box-office home run - petty snobbery, keeping up appearances, repressed yearnings for Bali Hi, and that profound American lament, ""I've Never Been To Me"".

And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality? How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected? Form a witches' coven? Invent a world language? Assassinate Castro? Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint? No. He drinks beer in front of the TV set, and gets a job in a hamburger joint. Can America's big-budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this?

Before dealing with the wider themes, I would like to tackle some details which bothered me. What is a gun doing in this story? Are Hollywood's screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can't construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully-overworked device of pistol-packing? The opening shower sequence was embarrassing. Adult jokes are fine by me, bawdy humour is great ... but this was unnecessary and degrading. It simply didn't belong. A narrator who announces that he is dead isn't a clever touch, it's just sloppy work. Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty? I find that hard to believe. And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character? Isn't this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues? So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin? We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause. Can't anyone see that this moral cave-in is profoundly anti-feminist? On a similar note, what was Thora Birch's topless shot all about? It defines the term 'gratuitous'.

And so, back to the broader picture. ""American Beauty"" isn't any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be. It isn't even mediocre. It's a tired, self-satisfied, deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time ""My Favourite Martian"" hit the TV screen. Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn't clever and isn't funny. It is gut-achingly DULL.

The question which arises, then, is why so many people are sincerely convinced that ""American Beauty"" outshines ""Citizen Kane"". I offer this for consideration ... they feel that way because they are told to. It doesn't work every single time, and sometimes it misses spectacularly, but Hollywood knows that as a general rule, advertising pays dividends. Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film, and they will accept the premises - both that they need to see it, and that it's mighty.

Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under-estimating the public. There's truth in that. Just provide the bread and the circuses, and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling.

The public wants what the public gets.",
20 November 2013,"Dude, it's just a plastic bag in the wind","Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are.

We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

27 July 2003,Hang Ups For Breakfast!!!!,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them?

5 February 2002,"The closer I look, the worse it gets","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999. I loved it. I really really loved it. I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less. I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over. At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD. It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.

The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say. It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned?

I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate: Fight Club. Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism. With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism. In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.

On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa. Fine. He makes a good point. No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.

There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I ""looked closer"" how conspicuous they are in their absence. We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene. They never make any reference to being cheerleaders. The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela.

I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is. ""Lame-o"" ""Geekboy"" ""Take a whizz"" It's just horrid. And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website? First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says ""augmentation"", which means a process of adding to).

The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act. The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin. For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through. Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!! It defies understanding.

The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together. I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend. But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming. But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me. Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being. Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.

The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along. It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go. The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder. Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree. But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff? [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says ""You know I'm joking, right?""]

The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of ""Three's Company."" Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else. That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts? Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story. The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!! And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later? It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but ""I know you're good for it"" isn't much better.

This film is ambitious. There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it. There are a lot of really good ideas. But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work.",6
17 March 2001,Over-Hyped Movie is a Bitter Disappointment,"Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called Oscar-winning ""masterpiece"" for me to make this review a brief one--but to the point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but struck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar script, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got was from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully, I was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view the movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar. As someone once said, ""the mirror of life should be tilted upwards"" more often to make films more inspirational. The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two hours of your life--look for true beauty elsewhere. A big thumbs down on this one.",
13 October 2020,The best of 1999.,"In an interesting shout-out to Sunset BLVD you already know the fate of the main character, played wonderfully by Kevin Spacey, as soon as the beginning credits end. This is an excellent film. The best from 1999 and well worth the Best Picture Award it got from the Academy that year. This is a great exploration of life and the hang-ups that accompany it. Spacey's character is a clown, but a person we can all relate to. Taboos are covered, like voyeurism by the daughter's boyfriend, the relationship that develops between Spacey and a young 17 year old girl and homosexuality that appears at the most unlikely time. Chris Cooper plays a tormented father who has no real idea who he really is. A great play on the misinterpretation on feelings too. An excellent commentary on the mid-life crisis phenomenon. The film travels along with a wonderful soundtrack. Oh! There also is a Scott Bakula sighting.

31 December 2015,For anyone who has ever wondered what the future might hold or questioned what could have been.,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.

Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).

27 November 2007,Spec-TAC-u-LAR!,"Okay, so I don't think there's much left to be said about this masterpiece. ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare instant classics, a landmark of the 90's and one of the best debut features ever (which is both a blessing and a curse for a director - let's hope Sam Mendes doesn't end up like Orson Welles).

This bittersweet tale of ordinary suburban lives about an average husband (Kevin Spacey), his ambitious wife (Annette Bening), their unhappy only child (Thora Birch), the weirdo next door (Wes Bentley), his severe father (Chris Cooper), his catatonic mother (Allison Janney) and a certain blonde cheerleader (Mena Suvari), reaches a heavenly level of authenticity and poignancy thanks to a witty, pitch-perfect script (by Alan Ball, who would later create the brilliant TV series ""Six Feet Under""), a wonderful cast (Spacey and Cooper, especially), Mendes's sensible directing, Conrad L. Hall's beautiful cinematography and Thomas Newman's unforgettable score (which has been copied ad nauseam since then, by the way).

""American Beauty"" is as thought-provoking and sad as it is, in a weird way, uplifting. To realize the mediocrity in your life; to try to change it or let it be, that's the question. Whichever's your choice, there'll be a high price to pay; thus, no one's a complete hero or villain in this story. Lack of communication, character flaws and hypocrisy all add up to what happens to these people; we feel bad for them, despise them, and root for them, for they all ring so true. That's because they're real, and great writers like Ball have a special talent to expose the good, the bad and the ugly in human nature.

My only ""problem"" with this film is that it came out in 1999 (one of the greatest years for films, ever), just like my all-time favourite, ""Magnolia"", which was almost completely snubbed by the Academy (which gave ""American Beauty"" 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Director). Naturally, I'd have liked ""Magnolia"" to win, but AB is a more than acceptable replacement since the Academy actually awarded a great film that year. ""American Beauty"", even without being the best film of its year, still manages to be a masterpiece.

""It's just a couch!"", Lester (Spacey) yells in one scene. ""This isn't life, it's just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts"".

And isn't he right?

6 April 2021,Pure poetry,"This film is not only about American Beauty, but also about the full concept of beauty, which concerns everybody. This deep theme is able to trap us into the story and make us feel the same feelings of the protagonist. The movie has a clear message: don't waste your time believing you're not going to make the difference in some way, get out, look around you and discover the spark that makes you feel at the highest level of your life. This is how I think of it. Sam Mendes, at his debut, already scored and the acotrs' performances were among the best of the decade. And you also find the poetry especially in the music by the incredible and underrated Thomas Newman.

Simply beautiful.

Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

Look closer.

28 June 2010,Sam Mendes Gets It Wrong -- Again,"Sam Mendes' entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them. Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain's problems before jumping across the pond.

""American Beauty"" is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn't exist. Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball's pretentious screenplay, forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say. Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance -- one-note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone -- that he gives every time he's in front of a camera, while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director, since she's never again been as bad, either before or since. The worst of the film's dialogue is reserved for all of the angst-filled teenagers, and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley, a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he's reciting Shakespeare.

The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn't really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper, a closeted ex-serviceman who, true to the film's form, is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America.

What is the point you ask of all this glib satire? Hell if I know.

21 October 2019,My 600th review on IMDb and such a perfect movie for it!,"Makes me smile at so many scenes, well deserving of the 5 Oscars! The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber. I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time. I'm delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu-Ray; American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I'd say number 8. The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever, to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well! Hope my thoughts aren't to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie!

6 November 2012,Beautiful!,"The first time I saw ""American Beauty"" was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.

Those first 40 minutes hadn't really left my head before. They were just absolutely gripping, full of incredible visuals, cinematography and absorbing writing and character development. Thankfully, the rest of the film doesn't disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I wasn't expecting to give it a perfect 10, as I only reserve that for the most special films, but this really is an incredible and outstanding film. It thoroughly deserves its best picture award!

What makes American Beauty works is its well-observed characters. At the centre of the film we've got Lester Burnham, who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey (another throughly deserving award winner) and is going through a mid-life crisis. We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion. You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage, his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job. You're almost rooting for him when he rebells. However, his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter's which are beautifully filmed.

The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned. We've got his controlling wife, also going through a mid-life breakdown, his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who've moved in next door, with their strange son and awful army dad. The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well-crafted, which means American Beauty never has a dull moment. Right from the startling opening, which confesses that Lester is going to die, the film never loses its grip on the audience as we're all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why!

The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible. It's also philosophical and very deep at times, as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining. There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones. As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet's ex. There is some breath-taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire. About every single shot is perfectly framed, making the film even more involving and seductive. American Beauty felt hypnotic at times, sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably.

American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally-charged ending. Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity, so we don't feel at all patronised. Lester's final narration is very touching, memorable and rounds the film off perfectly. American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film-making. It's a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it. There's great use of humour, superb writing, Oscar-worthy acting and sensational directing. American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was worth the 9 year wait!",10
10 April 2004,"A bit pretentious at times, exaggerated at others but will still touch a nerve with those of us that look at our `stuff' but wonder where our happiness went","Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut - he is having a midlife crisis, alienated from his wife and daughter, sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult. When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible. Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.

When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film. I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards. Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience. However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.

The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats. I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success. This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not. The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious. I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension! This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat. Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either. Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.

The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing). Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character. Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it. Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average. Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic. He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with. Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing! Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.

Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been. It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat. That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint.",
28 December 2022,"The harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are","American Beauty is a chronicle about ordinary people living through relatively ordinary dramas and that, in a way, end up reaching equally ordinary conclusions. Perhaps this is precisely the secret of the film, which, at the end of the projection, manages to lead us to curiously intense emotions: the fact that its message is universal. How to avoid identifying with a man as normal as the one played by Kevin Spacey? Directed by Sam Mendes, following the routine of a group of ordinary citizens, the plot portrays a family in the process of breaking up. Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn's (Annette Bening) marriage is a sea of coldness and arguments. Suddenly, he starts fantasizing about Angela (Mena Suvari), a teenager who is his daughter's friend. From then on, the protagonist makes major changes in his life that end tragically.

Sam Mendes' cinematographic debut, American Beauty has extremely symbolic moments that visually express the concepts inserted in its plot, skillfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. The first and most important of these elements, which should be visible to any viewer, are Mendes' framing that insistently highlights the presence of roses in the environment in which some sequences take place. These are not simple roses, but American beauties. Present in the original name of the film and in its literal national translation, american beauty is a variation of rose that is very common in the United States, visually perfect, but without smell or thorns. The subtlety with which Mendes presents them makes a parallel with the American suburban families that star in his story and that, apparently perfect with their beautiful homes, cars and smiles, are emotionally and evidently empty.

The main couple, composed of Carolyn and Lester, has so many facets that their characters, added to the fantastic interpretations of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, can be analyzed from multiple perspectives. The apparently controversial relationship that the two share, extremely maternal, is what stands out the most. It is enough to notice Carol's corporal imposition on Lester, who is constantly bowed before his presence, or the childlike treatment he receives from his wife. This dominant-dominated involvement is evident to the point that a sequence with sexual content between the two appears to be almost incestuous.

The fact is, Lester is unhappy. Ignored by his wife and daughter, he has worked for over a decade at a magazine that confines him to eternal servitude and the betrayal of all his youthful dreams. An existence where ""Yes, sir"" is as common an expression as ""Excuse me."" That's when his entire perception is altered by a magnificent vision: Angela, his daughter's teenage friend. Swept away by this new passion, Lester wakes up from the 'coma' he's been immersed in for years and decides to give himself a new chance. His goals are humble: he doesn't want to be rich or elected President. He just wants to respect himself and be happy. How not to be moved by a purpose so simple and, at the same time, so complex? Initially a defeated guy who can't even express his opinions aloud, Lester gradually regains his self-esteem through small victories. One night, for example, he has an argument with his wife and manages, after years, to say what he really thinks. His huge smile right after the fight highlights the importance of that apparently ridiculous situation. And his next sentence is a little pearl of common man wisdom: ""It's great to realize that we still have the ability to surprise ourselves.""

But Alan Ball's beautiful script is not just a midlife crisis: the story is a small revolving machine gun that does not bother to spare some of the most deeply rooted values of the American way of life (and of any reasonably industrialized civilization - read itself: dedicated to consumption). From the gay neighbors (apparently the most balanced in the film) to the family that lives next door to the Burnhams, everyone has something to hide: the great truth is that keeping up appearances is an art to which we all dedicate ourselves - and the film, in turn, , is dedicated to exposing this little hypocrisy that has become the norm in today's world.

The film has a multitude of details and symbolism that at first may go unnoticed by the viewer. The house where the families live reflect what they aspire to be: perfect and symmetrical. Inside Lester's house, all the furniture is symmetrically placed, has cool colors and has a specific function and at a given moment, it becomes clear that they are more important to his wife than himself. The garage, where he becomes his refuge, is a messier place, colorful and open to novelties. Which reflects directly on the couple's relationship, where Carolyn has much more space and much more power than Lester. Nor does Jane's room bear any resemblance to her personality, which ends up making the film incredibly fascinating, as it talks about appearances, about projecting an image of something you are not. And the Burnhams are far from a happy, close-knit family.

Kevin Spacey, however, is largely responsible for the success of American Beauty: there is not a single moment in which Lester's ""saga"" rings false - despite the absurdity of some situations. His initial lethargy is convincingly replaced by hilarious cynicism, finally giving way to absolute serenity. The expression on the actor's face when teenage Angela reveals to him that his daughter is in love represents, in itself, one of the most touching moments seen on film in years. When he finally says 'Good for her', the last movement of his transformation takes place: Lester finally realizes that happiness has always been within her reach - his frustration is what kept him from realizing it.

The other characters, however minor participation some may have, in no way can be considered disposable or supporting, as American Beauty is a work of many protagonists. Jane Burnham, played by Thora Birch, has the usual problems of adolescence that add to the upheavals that her family suffers, and she doesn't quite know how to behave in the face of it. When she meets Ricky (Wes Bentley), her new neighbor, she sees in him a possibility to put aside her fragility. Furthermore, newcomer Wes Bentley surprises by portraying a young man whose apparent madness is mere disguise for his poet's soul. Contrasted with the passivity of Jane's father, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), Ricky's father, is extremely disciplinarian and castrating, and throughout the film one understands the reasons that made him that way. Probably partly to blame for his wife's sanity, the colonel also makes his son's life untenable. The apparent one-dimensionality of Chris Cooper's character turns out to be a clever mask of the true complexity of his feelings.

Almost everyone in American Beauty seeks something, but ends up giving up or getting frustrated. Jane wants new breasts, but she gives up when she realizes that what she has is enough for the boyfriend she finally finds. Angela builds a sexually active persona to be accepted (a kind of search for otherness in pre-internet times), but when confronted with who she never was, she reveals herself as just an insecure little girl. Carolyn wants to achieve material and professional victory, but she does not have the competence to do so. The colonel wants a world governed by order and discipline, but fails when trying to do this in his own home, exposing how much his family is a failure. In the case of the colonel, the failure is even greater because he does not fall alone, since he does not even realize that his biggest defeat is far from his son: his catatonic and lost wife. Only Ricky and Lester, in a sense, by giving up the materialistic pursuit and acceptance of others, supposedly find their happiness.

Ball's script builds a side shadow announcing the protagonist's death and developing a series of small arcs that can open up countless possibilities to the public regarding the author of the murder (the recording of Ricky and Jane, Ricky with the keys to the gun cabinet of the father, Carolyn learning to shoot). It is a well-made primary narrative resource, but it is built through a script that develops so much thematically that, many years later, little or none of it is remembered. The basis of multiple themes and the acidity on which the ""who's going to do it"" of Lester's murder is based is much more perennial and striking.

American Beauty shows the consequences of a completely dehumanized and materialistic society that contrasts with the most intimate concerns of being. It seeks a critical look at our reality, in which we play roles, we constantly put on masks to try to fit into patterns. Our society is like a great masked ball, which changes over the years: son, father, grandfather, etc. All this to form a lifestyle, an aesthetic based on appearances and artifices, which began to take shape after the Second World War with the promotion of the American way of life. It is interesting to see how these masks are lost when sex appears on the scene, when individuals allow themselves to be carried away by these passions. From Lester to Colonel Fitts, passing through the teenagers Jane and Angela (Jane's friend), all succumb to desire and let their authentic yearnings and insecurities show through.

Sam Mendes' film presents the harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are. We deny, hide and use a multitude of masks in order to adapt and survive the established patterns. Undoubtedly, appearances are deceiving.",9
10 September 2021,"""You don't get to tell me what to do ever again""","Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline.

18 February 2019,Hollywood derives entertainment value from mental illness....,"Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and/or behavioral disorders. Yet, the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore, no meaningful message is given. Instead, the mainstream audience, not fully aware of signs of mental illness, are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder, are merely quirky, eccentric and at worst dysfunctional. Not a movie I would recommend and no meaningful message given. Hollywood just doesn't get it.

31 January 2008,One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.,"This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking.

29 March 2000,Cool Reaction,"""American Beauty"" frankly left me cool, unmoved, and repelled by its essence. There seemed something sickly about its basic conceit, something off balance and disturbed. While the quality of the acting and production was at a high level, the core of this work seemed unhealthy, exploitative, and overbaked. While there is room for exposing the homogonized and more sober aspects of suburbia, ""American Beauty,"" in a quest to make itself more competitive with other versions of the truth, tended to exaggerate its own emphasis. The result is a film which can be more appreciated for what it tries to accomplish than what it actually does.

3 December 2018,Better than I thought,"I just decided to watch this old movie for the first time, since I heard it was a classic. This is one of the few movies where I had water in my eyes. The story was very powerful, the drama was powerful, everything was powerful. ""There's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it."" I do not this see anything wrong with it, it was a simply a great movie to watch. Highly recommend it.

27 December 2000,Another Backflip By The Academy,"It makes no sense that the people at the Academy awarded this movie the Oscar. Since when have they awarded great movies best picture? Maybe this is the beginning of a new Academy without the corruption that has ruled for so long.

It was brilliant in every sense of the word, and should not be missed. Special mention must also be made to the excellent direction, and superb acting from the entire cast.

24 February 2000,The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled...,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

Look closer.

24 March 2004,Anti-American Beauty,"They live in the suburbs, therefore they are losers.

That is the sum total of the wisdom imparted by this dreary, pointless and joyless satire of middle-class America, circa 1998. The amazing thing about the film is that the filmmakers (and apparently many in the audience) think this film is bursting with original ideas and deep insights. When in reality, this is a tired retread of antiestablishment cliches from the sixties. The only difference is that films as diverse as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE to THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST to THE GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN to I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS knew how to instill the material with pathos, despair and anger and still show a flair for the wickedly funny and bitingly satirical. AMERICAN BEAUTY is a mean, bitter and shallow examination of people who are mean, bitter and shallow. While those films were daring and fresh, BEAUTY is stale and dirty.

Kevin Spacey plays the overworked, under appreciated middle-class corporate drone who drops out of the rat race due to a severe case of the middle-age crazies. Unfortunately, he may be out of the race, but he remains a rat. As played with smarmy snugness by Spacey, the character of Lester Burnham seeks, not inner peace, but self gratification. After resorting to blackmail to get his corporate freedom, he spends his newfound leisure time lusting after his teenaged daughter's cheerleader friend, berating his wife, experimenting with drugs and just generally being obnoxious. Spacey's much praised performance is largely without nuance or heart; a less sympathetic depiction of an ""everyman"" would be hard to come by.

Despite the film's supposed antiestablishment slant and vaguely pro-drugs attitude, the film hardly embraces liberalism. The film is not only antifeminist, but anti-woman as well, portraying Lester's wife (played by the otherwise wonderful Annette Benning) as a shrieking, materialistic shrike. (How dare she find capitalism and the suburbs to her liking!) The other women are mere sex objects. And despite the fact that several of the filmmakers are openly gay, the film is condescendingly homophobic as well: The gay guys next door are used as a joke and when a villain is needed for the finale, out trots the neighborhood closet case.

Good satire says ""This is us, aren't we something!"" Bad satire says ""This is them, aren't they pathetic!"" AMERICAN BEAUTY goes beyond bad satire. The filmmakers make no attempt to conceal their contempt for the American middle class, a group they obviously view with no respect, no sympathy or even a shred of affection. They do, however, seem to respect their moviegoing dollars.

The film's tagline was ""Look closer!"" A bold invitation, considering just how little clothes this emperor is wearing.",2

1 December 2021,Not everyone will be able to understand and see the beauty.,"American Beauty. Not everyone will be able to understand and see the beauty. In a good way, a very unusual and at the same time ordinary film. The plot is quite simple, but the message of the film itself can be understood in many ways. The acting is great, the music is amazing, and the film itself sinks into the soul for a very long time.

4 June 2001,This film is a fraud...,"""American Beauty"" is excessively praised as a great piece of American film, when in reality it isn't even good enough to be a decent rip-off of better films. Unfortunately, many viewers have fallen for it. (""Moonspinner55"" and ""tubist38"" have good reviews. Note that one person who initially praised the film reviewed it again a year later and said, ""What was I thinking?"") Mendes wastes some excellent actors in these meatball scenes (for example, Spacey throwing the asparagus...who couldn't do that well?) A lot of this film is some snappy one-liners or clever scenes strung together with...nothing. Everything that happens is almost laughably predictable. And the crucial scene, where an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind is supposed to impart some deep meaning on the true nature of existence in the phenomenal world? Right. Finally, I must comment on Annette Bening, who is one of the better actresses working today being cast in the role of a cartoon...what a waste.

This film is a ""1,"" and should in fact have a turkey symbol next to it. ""American Beauty"" is the perfect symbol of the decline of the serious American film. ""Ordinary People,"" ""Out of the Blue,"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" are much better films.",1

25 September 1999,One of the Best films of 1999!!,"A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999, is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning (robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT), and Alan Ball (most original screenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICE STORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen. Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for ""The American Beauty"" he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visual feast. Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is a sort sexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana. She is in a word ""wonderful."" The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE. He deals drugs, observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door. We know immediately, that like everyone else in this movie, he is not as he appears. AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away, layer by layer, this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there. If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICAN BEAUTY.",10
11 October 2007,Beautiful,"So much has been said about this movie that it's hard to think of what else I could add. I wasn't even going to comment on the film for this precise reason, but then I figured I needed to give my favorite film of all time a shout out.

To start, I honestly believe that this is one of the true masterpieces of the decade. This is a beautifully crafted movie on absolutely every level but it's the use and exploration of character throughout that makes it truly astonishing. I find each of the characters incredibly fascinating and very rich. The tagline ""Look Closer"" is spot on because there's always more going on than what you observe on the surface. If I'm ever missing the beauty in my own world, this is a great work of art to remind me that I don't have to look very far.

23 September 2005,"""American Beauty"" is to 1999 what ""The Graduate"" is to 1967","I think that it's appropriate that ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999. In that year, I was as old as my parents were in 1967, when ""The Graduate"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" both came out. Those were both movies that presented things differently than most movies previously had. Entertainment Weekly called 1999 something like ""the year that changed movies"", citing ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" as examples.

Anyway, ""American Beauty"" is an indictment of the suburban lifestyle. Middle class Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) has a steady job and a typical family. His self-indulgent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) seems absolutely bent on training their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) to be ""perfect"". But then, when Lester catches sight of Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a dance, the whole Burnham household begins to go through some massive changes. Changes which will irrevocably alter everything.

This may be the perfect movie. I can't even begin to describe how good it is. With top-notch performances from its main players (plus outstanding performances from Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards and Peter Gallagher), an excellent script by Alan Ball, and A-one direction by Sam Mendes, you can see why it won Best Picture.

Just an extra note. There is a scene that might make you giggle. I won't tell you what it is, but it involves ""choking the bishop"".",10
5 January 2005,Just for the people who missed this Masterpiece.,"At over 5 years old this movie has probably been seen by most people already. But just in case it did pass you by, for whatever reason, i suggest that you see it as soon as possible.

The characterisation is sublime and has not to my knowledge been matched since, every stereotypical character is so realistically portrayed, by a combination of fine acting, great writing and excellent direction; that you feel a connection with everyone in the movie.

I won't try and link this film with any particular genre, as i believe it stands out on its own, but i will say this. Whatever kind of film you usually go for, 99% of you will like this one, and most of you will love it.

Look closer and you will find an absolute gem.

26 April 2005,My extended review of the film,"'American Beauty' is a film about people and how they live. At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production.

The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball's original screenplay. It is alternates from amusing and touching, perceptive and funny, and the characters are all very well developed and feel real. A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin, but they are just the opposite. We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life. Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries, while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle. Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end, and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets.

Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward. This however is quite a subjective judgment, as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough? If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of, sure some people would look deeper, but others will be put off. I feel that 'American Beauty' has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination, and what is said out loud is not unnatural. It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people: casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike.

There is not really much else that people tend to complain about, and really there is hardly anything at all to not like. The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two. They are not the type of flaws that should affect one's viewing experience, unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered. But that again is subjective.

The technical aspects of the film are wonderful. Thomas Newman's score is very low-key and simple when needed, and more zapped when required. Conrad L. Hall has meticulously set up every single shot. His use of out-of-focus backgrounds and foregrounds, high and low camera angels, and swooping shot is perfect. The film all flows very well, and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in. The set décor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places. Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself.

To compliment the film's other virtues, the cast give it their best with good results. Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters, and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances. Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger, and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter. But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour, Wes Bentley as his teenage son, and Alison Janney as his wife, who seems just a little too detached from life. Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch's school friend who values her looks above everything.

This is a film that touches on many different human concerns. Beauty, as in the title, is a key theme, and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film. Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder, and we are shown the digital pictures. There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another. People see things in many different ways because we are all different, yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment, and the film tries to show this. 'American Beauty' starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him, but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life.",10
15 October 2020,"""I rule!"" Do you? Do you though?","Suburban life isn't all rose petals, jail bait cheerleaders and gay neo-nazis in the closet! Something much darker lies beneath the veneer and whatever it is, it's not only dark, it's beautiful. American Beauty is a mid-life crisis tale that's heavy on the men's lib message. Spacey gives his I'm-so-bored drawl and every word he utters conveys the cynical sarcastic disdain he feels for the world. But his performance is not without levity. Watch him as he says, ""I rule."" It's fantastically subtle. Subtle in a look-at-how-funny-that-is way. When he finally begins to assert himself, it is remarkably poignant. Watch him throw asparagus against the wall. No, it's not a potential precursor to domestic violence. It's a declaration of independence whereupon you happily applaud Spacey's descent into me-me-me world. Meanwhile, his daughter Missy Miserable, played by Thora Birch is committed to the dead stare demeanor. Her only guide as she navigates the teenage wasteland is blonde bimbo Jenny Jailbait. Thora is a disillusioned youth in need of a more thoughtful peer. Enter the eccentric and creepy Ricky Fitts. As far as Ricky is concerned, Mena is a bland blonde and Thora is a glowing angel of tortured teendom. Ricky is an immediately endearing character for the fact that he appears to have been born with a paralyzing birth defect - the inability to blink. Ricky's sole purpose in life is to mock the stuffy suburbanite pursuit of perfection. This is something he can do simply by standing in one place without blinking. Observe his psycho-killer stare as he balances sincerity with pretentious existential insights. The epic plastic bag dance is so stunning that wide-eyed Ricky feels like he might pass out from its beauty. For Ricky, a plastic bag is a bigger tearjerker than Lester's morning grip in the shower.

As cinematic as this film is visually, you still get bits of that late 90s staple, digital hand-held technique. You see, the only way you can catch the raw truth of life is through the seemingly cold and impersonal lense of a digital camera. Yes, this came out the same year as Blair Witch. American Beauty is a cul de sac of tragedy and sickly stirring dreams where one's ambition and desire supersedes any responsibility to anyone else. Well, at least that's what it is if your name is Lester Burnham.",8
2 November 2018,Make more movies like this todayyy,"Oh my gosh, I forgot how great this movie is. Kevin Spacey nailed his character with remarkable performance. Camera work is amazing and it shows everyday problems in marriage and society. Ending is perfect and the movie deserved all the praise and Oscar.

18 August 2013,Brilliant drama,"American Beauty is a brilliant drama, so powerful and moving. Having read roughly what the film was about before I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be. There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way.

The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey. Wes Bentley is also deserving of a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour. The way it ended won't be to everyone's taste but for me it makes it more memorable.

Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and I would certainly watch again. Top marks from me, one of the best dramas I've seen.

30 March 2006,Obsessions can be deadly,"Ahh, the joys of middle age. I remember a day at work, when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him. I didn't know who he was talking about; then it dawned on me; he was talking about me. Middle aged men, like Kevin Spacey, do have these fantasies from time to time. The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable, it should never have been an issue. In the meantime, we have the guy next door, with the hangups and his sexual identity issues. It's a sick mix. It's intriguing, but who would want to be there? Of course, marriages begin to fall apart, people begin to try to be what they are not, and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch. Someone is going to get hurt; someone may even die. Like Gene Wilder in ""The Woman in Red"" if our lives ended right now, it may be worth it. Unfortunately, tomorrow is another day. What were we thinking? Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what? The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether.

The acting is excellent. This movie is so intense and so absorbing, you can't take your eyes off it, like a traffic accident. I don't feel better for having seen it, but it's a sign of our time in life.",8
3 September 2022,"Unexpected, raw, unique, flawless, art...","Unexpected, raw, unique, flawless, art... just a few words that come to mind after watching this movie. I didn't expect that this movie would the THIS good.

When I read the title, I originally thought that this movie would be about horses. I must have mistaken myself with the movie ""Black Beauty"". But after watching ""American Beauty"", the color black has some meaning. Because black stands for dark... and for certain it can be said that ""American Beauty"" is a dark movie!

But OMG, it is so good. The acting of every one of the actors is just outstanding! Each one of them could have easily deserves an Academy Award.

I can not give a bad comment about this movie. It easily deserves 9 stars.

11 March 2015,"Where's ""The Beauty"" (or storyline for that matter)?","I have to agree with those IMDb reviewers who simply cannot understand how this movie won the Best Picture award or for that matter, how it is even considered a good film. It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par. Quite frankly, definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own.

10 November 2021,Dark and depressing,"Dark and depressing film unfortunately. Great acting, but very dark. I've mentioned that the first half of the film was somewhat slow and ponderous. The second half was much better. The second half of the film has a darker edge to it and it finally seemed like the film was starting to make an attempt at social commentary. The character plot twists admittedly were somewhat predictable, I still liked the way that many of the characters became sort of an 'anti-cliche' in the end. This is a tough one for me as the film does have a mix of good and bad. If the first half of the film had been as good as the second half then I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the lack of focus and general cringe inducing first half meant it wasn't an easy ride getting to the much more enjoyable second half. I'm on the fence on this one. There is good and bad in equal measures.

5 June 2000,"Can anyone say ""Rip off""?","Take two infinitely more superior films called ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Happiness"" and mix them together in a bowl. Add a touch. Just a touch of Alan Ball's imagination and you have ""American Beauty"". The most over-hyped and over-praised film I've seen in my life.

In one measly little sentence...this film is NOT new. I've seen it all before and better in the aforementioned films. While I do think that the cinematography and color design was the best thing about the film the absolute worst was the rest. There is not any film out there that can be as pompous and self-serving as this garbage.

It may be well cast and the actors my ravage their roles with unholy relish but it just isn't new. It's been done already. I rank this with ""The Insider"" as one of those movie people only see the good side of and give good reviews to without realising they have been brainwashed by other peoples opinions before seeing it. If this is not the case they only give it a decent review out of respect to the filmakers/actors previous work. I'm not kidding. For both of these movies this is the conclusion I reached after pooling many peoples opinions.

""American Beauty"" is VERY, VERY overhyped and NOT original. See it and make up your own mind. Don't listen to anyone elses voice but your own. If you still like it then I still respect you.",1
12 March 2021,"Alan Ball wrote, Sam Mendes directed","Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Mena Sorvina, Thora Burch, west Bently, and Chris Cooper. are main actors in this highest quality film. Something is changing their lives. New neighbors. New relationships. New job. A young attraction. A quick rejection. Some of it is like Rear Window. Everything moves toward the inevitable climax. A new boy drug dealer neighbor and his violent father with a gun collection and a Nazi plate are the core action; film name should be American Neighbors. The American beauty is a sub plot. Spacey is attracted but that's all. Allison Janney is the neighbor's wife. It is a misleading title,because the source of the action is not the attraction of Spacey to Sorvina, but his daughter's attraction to the new boy drug dealer with the violent father, Chris Cooper who should get an Oscar for his performance.

30 August 2014,Ugly,"Dear, oh dear...it was overrated when it was released, and it hasn't aged well.

This is supposed to be 'clever'. ""Look closer"" and you'll see the things in peoples' 'stupid little lives' that are disguised by the middle- class American 'commercial'. The respectable dads are in fact self-hating homosexual Nazis, the respectable career-minded wives are unfulfilled materialistic harridans, and their children are smarter-than-thou shallow brats. The only crime is being honest about the phoniness, punishable by expulsion and execution. All it takes is Mendes and his video camera to expose the truth. No wonder liberal Hollywood went gaga.

9 September 2005,"Excellent, Thought Provoking Movie","American Beauty is a modern masterpiece and rightly deserves it place in the top 250. The cinema has been producing a lot of terrible movies lately. This one stands with the great ones such as The Shawshank Redemtion, The Green Mile, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Se7en and the list goes on. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The acting, directing, score, mood, cinematography are all superb.

Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is suffering his mid-life crisis. His bitchy wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is annoying him. His moody daughter Jane (Thora Birch) isn't helping. Things start to change when he sees Jane's cheer leading friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a school function. He starts having fantasies of a naked Angela covered in red roses. His actions that follow change his family for the worst.

Sam Mendes has created something that will stick with the viewers of this wonderful movie. We witness are family that looks perfect on the outside crumble into to something horrific. How one person's actions can effect everyone around him. Kevin Spacey is superb in his role as the unstable husband/father. He portrays him so well his character is disturbing and we kind of feel sorry for him but at the same time we don't. Annette Bening is great as the wife/mother who we really don't like but feel sorry for. Thora Birch is also great as the daughter who has developed a crush on her neighbour. The supporting cast is great.

5/5.",10
24 April 2021,American Beauty,"A wonderful movie that presented the midlife crisis beautifully, the acting in the movie was great from all the actors, especially Kevin Spacey, who gave a great performance in the movie, but Brad Pitt deserved an Academy Award for his performance in Fight Club more than Kevin Spacey, the story of the film was fun and interesting I liked most of the characters in the movie, but I didn't like Jane. Nor did Carolyn, I recommend watching the movie.

4 March 2000,LOOK CLOSER at this BEAUTiful AMERICAN film.,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

Look closer.

12 July 2020,american beauty,"American beauty is a well good shown and represanted life of family that has a lot of problems in it and how they are trying to work around them and somehow trying it to fix them,i would say this this movie had some strong messages in it also,about how fast life can past fast and how regret about making some decisions can have a big mark and effect on us in a future and take a big toll on us,spacey for me give performance of lifetime here and for me he may be one of those actors that are able to put them selfs in a very difficult roles but somehow act like that is the easiest mission in a world,rest of cast werent on his level,except chris cooper but they were solid in their roles,american beauty was sometimes depressing movie but it had some really strong staff and messages in it

14 October 2007,Look closer...,"With some of the best writing, characters, and scenes ever put to film, American Beauty is simply a luscious and beautiful movie. It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored.

In all honesty, I wasn't exactly the biggest fan of Kevin Spacey before I saw this movie. My overall opinion on him was that he was a so-so actor that had his good movies and his bad movies. This film changed my mind all together. Spacey's performance is heartbreaking, perfect, and most importantly, realistic. The entire time he is on screen, he literally is just magnificent. Wes Bentley was also captivating to watch, and it's really a wonder that he's not a bigger movie star. His performance in this film was just flawless and incredible. He is quite the scene-stealer, and often outshines some of the other actors.

Overall, American Beauty was a fantastically good film with some of the best writing around. The movie was moving, realistic, and though-provoking; could one really expect any less from the genius Alan Ball, who is also responsible for the amazingness that is Six Feet Under. Don't miss this film under any circumstances, as it is by far one of the most excellent films I have ever seen.",10
4 June 2020,"Perfect, in every sense of the word","If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be 'brilliant.' Nothing has truly captured the mundane and inner thoughts and demons surrounding people and their human natures quite like this before, nor has any film been able to play it off in such a unique manner. It's a timeless film that somehow manages to be incredibly insightful, without ever feeling a slight bit dull or boring. It's interesting, entertaining, cleverly shot, well written, and fantastically acted. There is little to say the film didn't do right. Kevin Spacey gives one of, if not, the best performance of his career and he is well deserving of his Oscar win. His portrayal of the character Lester Burnham can often be imitated in many aspiring filmmakers works today, but even though it is often imitated, none can replicate the brilliance that Spacey puts into the performance. His acting is not only realistic, but also endlessly enjoyable to watch, and you won't want to take your eyes off the screen when he steals every scene he possibly can. The other actors in the film are quite great as well. Annette Bening gives a wonderfully poignant performance as Carolyn Burnham and provides a greater glimpse into the struggling suburban wife we have all come to know at some point in our lives. Her performance isn't just an advance on a stereotype however, and neither is the character, but rather a fresh perspective on how someone so mundane and yet trouble-filled can be living throughout their own life. Though no performance in the film shine quite as notably as these two; Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper all give quite notable performances on their own- with somewhat less screen time to let their roles shine. The film is written beautifully, and its incite and story is so incredibly down to earth- and yet so wonderfully magical all at once. It's direction is perfect, with it being Mendes' first effort, it truly shows how impressive he is as a filmmaker. The film is also shot beautifully, and is well deserved of its Oscar win for cinematography, with its endlessly perfect and interesting shots that truly help the film to keep up its amazing stature. The one flaw I can see the film being ridiculed for, is it being slightly predictable at times, but even with this small flaw- American Beauty seems to make it not just a flaw but a quirk of its story- by providing such realistic values and lifelike scenarios- that you can't help but feel like if you were in the same situation, you could predict it yourself. In the end, American Beauty is a timeless effort from all those involved- filled with some wonderful writing by Alan Ball and wonderful direction from Sam Mendes. Spacey's performance, as is the film, is timeless and all in all both go in my personal favorite moments in all of film history. My Rating: 10/10",10
10 October 1999,One of the year's finest,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film.",10
5 August 2000,Suburban nightmare for America,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

American Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club,the best film I have seen in a very long time,in it's themes about commercial fulfillment,the barriers constricting the boredom of life,and human emptieness.The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester,played by Kevin Spacey,has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she's got.This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern,rather than concern for each other. Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America.Whatever the wake up call was aimed at,whoever it's targeted towards ought to take note.Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life,we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on,a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him,his boss,his colleagues,his daughter,his wife.This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be.

Aside from the main character, all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well.His wife is a self obsessed,over expectant career woman,who only gets sad about what's bothering her.His daughter is a distant,stubborn teenager ,who does'nt give any clear indication of what she wants.Her friend is a narrow minded,pretentious,and stupid slapper,who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are.And as for the new neighbours,well.....................perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate,understand,love,and,heck,even know each other.

This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people's miserable lives,and gets you caring about their various outcomes.All the performances are,obviously,excellent,and Sam Mendes provides unique,insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches.

Overall,having seen it,I'm glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did.For once,they gave them to a film that truly deserved it.*****",
1 January 2005,Look closer...and see how you've been duped,"I've got to hand it to the person who came up with the ""Look closer"" tag line. It was an absolutely brilliant move - one of the greatest scams perpetrated on a gullible public since the creation of the Ponzi Scheme.

Why do I say this? Because the hubbub over this film very much reminds me of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", with multitudes saying how wonderful the new clothes look, but no one admitting to seeing nothing, for fear of being regarded as ""stupid"".

And that's exactly what's going on with all the nonsensical critical acclaim for this film. Want proof? Just ""look closer"" at the comments in this board. Over and over again, people will heap praises on this film. But do you notice something? Their interpretations are never the same! They're all seeing something different. Just like the Emperor's invisible clothes, there are hundreds of reasons given as to why this is a wonderful film, but the only thing consistent about those who praise it is their conviction and attitude that anyone who doesn't see the ""beauty"" of this film is ""dumb"".

Look closer? WHAT FOR? There's nothing to see! Gee, it feels great to be ignorant.

(A note to all those who will be enraged by what I am saying here: Rather than attack me, I want you to tell me EXACTLY why this is such a good film. I will later post all of the many, many interpretations I receive, which will just further prove my point.)",1

This movie IS Kevin Spacey, he steals the story and is fantastic throughout the entire film.

I doubt very much that this film would be so revered had another actor played his role?

If you are a fan of Kevin Spacey then you are a fan of this film.

30 January 2023,American Beauty - Capturing the American Dream?,"Kevin Spacey was one of the hottest actors in Hollywood before he ran into his period of decline. There was no film, nor role, that he could not handle. He was versatile, had a sense of humor, and could play deadly dramatic roles with the greatest of ease. He excels in this film about the alienation of a middle-aged man with his unfortunate lot in life. He wants to be successful, but he hates being a yes-man, a man who has no substance, merely form. In other words, his two-faced insincerity begins to gnaw at his inner self. His hypocritical behavior is temporarily halted by a pretty young thing, but eventually, his true character comes to bear, and that is not in any way, shape or form like the pretty young thing. There will be millions of middle-aged men who will be able to relate to this film.

20 June 2014,I had mixed feelings about this film,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

10 February 2001,The answer to the question nobody asked,"Despite a few good chuckles there isn't much else I liked about this one. I felt the movie came off like some early mid 80's tv movie. I didn't relate to anything the movie had to say and there was at least two other movies in the last 16 months dealing with guys going to work and insulting, blackmailing, or assaulting their bosses. Both Fight Club and Office Space were far better at it.

While I do not criticise too much on the interpetive aspect of the movie, I will just say that I really didn't enjoy this one at all. Depending on what scene I was watching I couldn't decide whether I was watching a porno, a saturday night live skit, USA up all night, MTV""s undressed, Ordinary People, or more porno.

Onetime watching this turkey was both once enough and once too many.

1 April 2005,The Antithesis of Beautiful,"I am afraid I found this movie appalling. The characters were cruel, unpleasant, bitter and twisted. The central male character has fantasies about the teenage school friend of his own daughter - I'm sorry, but that is disgusting and in an age where children are being groomed to be adults, frankly irresponsible.

His wife was a bitter shrew, you are supposed to feel sympathy for Lester, he's such a rebel! Forgive my sarcasm, but as rebellions go, chucking up your corporate job to work in a fast food restaurant - yawn!! Smoking dope - yawn!! All his rebellion was about himself. He couldn't even rebel and do something worthwhile.

What Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning were thinking when they signed up for this, I cannot imagine. I respected them as versatile and talented members of the Hollywood acting fraternity, they have definitely lost points with me for this twaddle.

Virtually every action, every word, every look and every nuance in this film was unpleasant. If you want to look for rebellion and suburban angst, watch the infinitely better and wickedly funny Desperate Housewives; you will be amazed!",1

23 May 2000,My wife called it a stupid movie,"I agree with her, and after the hype is over no one will remember this film 3 years from now. It will drop from the #2 spot within time, trust me. Had some sort of political message, try to figure it out but more weird then anything else. It's about mid-life crisics, and how one individual relives his youth inorder to escape the rut of his personal, and work life.

17 April 2002,Pointless endeavor with no redeeming qualities,"Quite possibly one of the least deserving Oscar winners of all time, American Beauty simply spikes a hot iron into my hide every time I hear praise dished out to it.

I will admit, I thought it was pretty good the first time around, but then, I realized my lack of insight proved to be poorly developed. Like a bad wake-up call, I realized how stupid and idiotic this film was, kind of like enjoying a video game from 1986, then seeing how poorly it has aged compared to today's standards. American Beauty accomplished this in a matter of months.

The characters, except for Lester, had no point. The kids were poorly drawn characters, excessive moot that could have been edited out of the film. This film had no idea what mood it wanted to be, no semblance of consistency, and no reason to be made in the first place. A film I will continue hating until I'm six feet under.

26 June 2002,yet again the critics and the american academy get it wrong,"a film so up its own end it hurts. after a promising start, this slides into cliche and over the top melodrama trying to be funny, all good actors, are put to no good use by a mediocre script and flat direction how the guy got an oscar for this is amazing, or maybe not the academy has not been know to vote for the best in any year, they always seem to vote politcally, so all the directors probably thought that no one esle would for mendes, but of course they did. its funereal pace and obvious gags make it hard going to sit through and the confused and ""lets be clever"" ending leaves you feeling that it really has been a waste of time

6 May 2016,"""...And in a way, I am dead already.""","""American Beauty"" is a pure cinematic triumph that is both funny and sad. It's disturbing... and yet, it's extremely provocative and deep. The film is an extraordinary achievement that reveals a tragic and realistic story about a family that is anything but ordinary. It's a film with so many layers that it is almost impossible to dissect them all in one single thought.

Meet Lester Burnham; a man who feels like he's completely dead inside. His wife and daughter despise him and do not show him any signs of respect. On the surface, the family seems like a picture-perfect family that everybody dreams about--but inside is a completely different matter. His wife is obsessed with material possessions and doesn't care for ""petty"" things like love or life, while his daughter resents herself because she isn't ""perfect."" Lester's mental coma is rudely interrupted when he meets his daughter's friend and starts fantasizing about her. The awakening might be due to a disturbing thought or feeling, but the wake-up call changes Lester and allows him to realize that there's always time to erase his ""forced-image"" and be the person he really is. This is all a set-up for a funny, disturbing and tragic movie. I don't know about everybody else, but my mind was literally racing around when this movie was playing before my eyes. It's one of those films that allows you to pick up on something different upon each viewing.

21 October 2012,"""A little too overrated.""","The film is the showcase of American people lifestyle. However I do believe that films do present things with a little exaggeration and that they are mostly not true (Unless of course based on true incident.). But considering that 40% of all is true I pitied while watching the movie, because of the sad lives of the American families. The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester. He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn't show much respect to him. There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her. While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious. I have always loved family dramas because they are the best source of information about the middle class people of that country. To be really true I felt like laughing after watching the film. Having watched a lot of dramas in various languages we have the portrayal of American family which is so sad.

PROS:

The film has emotional dramas mixed with a little humor at appropriate places. There are misunderstandings also. There is a hidden message present in the film. I feel happy to say that the director was able to portray a very important thing – ""Happiness"". When you will focus on the characters, you will found out that no one was happy in reality. All of them were hiding behind a sense of misjudgment. Sometimes even this is conveyed through dialogs when the characters say to each other's that you are just a sad old man. The movie wanted to convey that you have to really find happiness somewhere; otherwise ultimately you will get frustrated. Then this frustration ultimately leads to a lot of further problems.

CONS:

While everything including the story and the acting of the cast was perfect, I felt like some kind of energy was lacking in the film. It will give you instances to laugh or feel bad but all comes too slowly and have a dull demeanor.

MESSAGE: ""Find Happiness.""

VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",8
31 January 2014,Obsessions and secrets in Suburbia,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is enduring a cold marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) is obsessed with her real estate career. He is obsessed with his daughter's sexy friend Angela (Mena Suvari). His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is the object of obsession by the next door neighbor boy Ricky (Wes Bentley). Ricky has a domineering angry military father (Chris Cooper), and he sells weed.

Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have captured the mood of obsessions and secrets in suburbia. This plays like a voyeuristic peep show as the characters peel back the layers of secrets. It's not creepy but it is enchanting. This movie lures you in, and traps you in something forbidden. Kevin Spacey is absolutely wonderful as a torn man. And Thora Birch is great as the angry daughter. It's the perverse mundaneness of suburbia and its many secrets.

7 January 2011,I can't really say it was a classic at all.,"Don't get me wrong, I have heard about it being critically acclaim by many critics and viewers, except I just don't accept it to be a classic.

A movie about a troubling family where the mom is an unsuccessful real estate agent and the dad has problems with work and his relationship with his wife. Their only daughter is struggling to find the right boyfriend as well. The dad then decides to change his life style after encountering with a girl who is friends with his daughter. The plot get complicated when a military family moves into the neighborhood where the son is a drug addict and the dad is military strict.

Parts of this movie was funny, I give it that much credit. However there were parts I found very hard to watch. The misunderstandings and the military dad were one of the reasons I don't consider this film a classic at all. Would I ever watch it again? No I wouldn't.

A quasi comedy-drama about middle America, Kevin Spacey stars plays Lester Burnham, who has a mid-life crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari).

Annette Bening is his materialistic wife, who has fallen out of love with him and is having an affair. Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter who at first plays second fiddle with the more beautiful and forward Angela, but later finds solace with their new neighbour played by Wes Bentley.

At first she finds Wes strange as he keeps trying to photograph her. Chris Cooper is his militaristic father who is a stern disciplinarian but seems to have deep personal issues of his own.

When I saw American Beauty upon its release I did not think much of it and I note its reputation seems to have declined over the years.

Like a lot of Best Oscar picture winners in recent years, some people think it was undeserving of the top prize.

Strangely, after re-watching this film after a number of years I have revised my rating upwards. Maybe it is because I am now older along with now older children. I viewed this film differently and interpreted the story with differing nuances.

Spacey is probably in a rare role where he is likable. He realises that his life is in a mess, besotted by a nubile college girl, trapped in a loveless marriage and lost his job.

However he is trying to improve himself, working out and staying optimistic but fate has a different story for him.

The themes in this film will vary at different points in your life. If you are middle aged with teenage children it might even be unnerving.",7
12 November 2011,"Very-Very-Very ""American Ugly"", If You Ask Me","*May Contain Spoilers*

Critics be damned - American Beauty has got to be one of the most despicable depictions of male, mid-life crisis that has ever been filmed.

If Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, was supposed to actually represent an average, 42 year-old, American male in mid-life crisis, then I believe that our society, in general, is in even more trouble than I had originally thought. Burnham was, basically, nothing but a big, self-centered baby.

I was truly astounded to see just how utterly slimy that Burnham was in his day-to-day dealings with other people. For starters, to terminate his employment at the advertising firm, Burnham actually stooped to threatening his boss with blackmail and exposing him as a homosexual, even though the guy wasn't even a homosexual, at all.

Lester Burnham, a low-life, pedophilliac bugger, who lusted like a grunting pig after 16 year-old girls, deserved the crappy job that he chose for himself at MacDonalds. Being a crummy, little burger-flipper was so him.

Even though I don't condone cold-blooded murder, I certainly felt no remorse for Burnham when he was gunned down by Frank Fits. In a sense, he bloody-well had it coming.

One can only shudder to think of how many other people's lives that Burnham would have eventually contaminated had he continued to remain alive. At the rate that he was going I'm sure that he would have inevitably resorted to exposing himself in public, or molesting very young children, or something as equally vile as that.

I find it very-very peculiar, indeed, that American Beauty actually struck such a unanimously positive chord with a vast number of the movie-going public. I guess that these many viewers must've strongly identified with the screwed-up characters and off-kilter situations that were presented in this movie. I surely didn't feel that way.

All-in-all, I certainly saw nothing in American Beauty that even slightly resembled that of ""beauty"" (above or below the surface). It was all looking pretty ugly to me.

What more can I say?",2
8 February 2007,The Academy Hits A New Low To End The Century,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

15 October 2013,A Rose By Any Other Name,"Could this ""Little"" Film be more Overrated. It's Doubtful. Living up to Best Picture/Director, etc, of the Year is quite a lot of Reputation to Bare. But here it is. A Liberal Wet Dream that is not very Clever or Insightful but does have a Teenage-Middle-Age/Class-American Dream-Angst going for it and all done Beautifully.

The Acting is very strong all around and it has a Smooth Pacing, the Shallow Writing tackles some Touchy Subjects with a Bitten Tongue-in-the-Cheek, but to say that this is Great Stuff, Profound, New, or much more than Breezy Satire is Saying more than it Deserves.

There are Semi-Predictable Twists and it wears practically all of its Pretensions and Points Boldly, like one of those Self-Made T-Shirts. For all of its Accolades can Anyone actually say that they haven't seen this so many times before, so much as to have become Clichés. So no, this is just another take on the same old thing and rather well done at that. But, come on, take a deep breath, and Stop and smell the Roses. Yea...they smell the same here as they did before.",7
6 June 2011,What a movie!,"Ever wonder what the mysterious neighbors down the street are up to? Do you ever wonder what kind of dark secrets and twisted tales might be lying just down the road from you? Wouldn't you like to know all of the harsh realities of your seemingly utopian suburb? Or would you? Would it really be worth it to know just how dark the simple suburban neighborhood can be? Could you really handle what kind of unexpectedly horrendous things could be unfolding so close to home in such a picturesque neighborhood like yours? Watch American Beauty and you'll find out.

1999's best picture winner tells the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a depressed suburban husband/father who after so much ridicule and neglect from his wife and daughter decides he has had enough and attempts to improve his life. What really kick starts this change is his perverted obsession with his daughter's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). And so while Lester tries to impress Angela, the rest of his family and neighbors try to cope with their own mundane existences. Lester's wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a real estate agent trying to better herself in every way possible, trying so hard not to be a victim of herself. Lester's daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is trying to survive living with her neurotic and psychotic parents, finding shelter in her next door neighbor Ricky, a nineteen year old boy who spends his days filming the subtle and rare beauties in life, while also dealing with an abusive father. This is a film that so masterfully blends together the twisted fates of a collection of fabulously interesting characters, all in an ironically simple suburban setting. It chronicles the dark side of the American dream and seeks to discover what true American beauty really is.

Films like this really just blow me away in every way possible. American Beauty is both hilarious and gripping, sometimes simultaneously. It possesses a script that is equally witty and laugh out loud hysterical as it is poetically and ingeniously constructed and structured. The film never leans too far to one side of its humorous and serious spectrum. There is always a dab of ironic hilarity in the serious moments, and a drop of biting sophistication in the comic scenes. This is a film where every scenes gets better and better. The film starts out with a ironically bitter attitude and the mood continues on like this, throwing in plenty of harsh satire that entertains as much as it gets you thinking. The entire story is so masterfully worked out with every character and every action contributing something to the themes of gilded beauty false images. It's also worth pointing out just how subtly these important themes are displayed throughout the film, never coming in as overbearing or blatantly obvious. Some of the messages are spelled out at times, but not without grace or poeticism. Yet the deeper meaning of this film is still excellently hidden in subtext underneath fantastic characters and an incredible story.

It's also worth mentioning the acting in this film. American Beauty wouldn't be the incredible movie that it is without some of the most impressive performances ever put on film. Kevin Spacey could not have played the sardonic, depressed, and hilariously bitter Lester Burnham any better. His performance is one of the few that I can confidently call perfect. He took home one of the most deserved Oscars of all time in 1999. And while Spacey carries the film so incredibly well, the supporting cast holds their own just as well. Annette Bening is incredible enticing as the deranged suburban wife and Thora Birch plays the daughter of two nut jobs so excellently. Mena Suvari as Angela, Jane's friend, is incredible, playing one of the strangest characters in a movie full of strange people. Then there is Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper as a father/son pair. Both of their performances are outstanding and the dynamic between these two characters is incredible. They create some of the most emotionally gripping scenes of the entire film which says a lot of a film that is so enthralling.

This is one of those rare films that works equally well when you take it at face value and when you read between the lines and think deeper into its hidden meanings. Everything about this film is excellent, and it all cultivates into one masterful final product that compels and mystifies to no end. This film is haunting in a realistically disturbing way. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be utterly blown away by American Beauty.",9
18 September 2019,American Beauty impacted my life,"Middle-aged Lester has an epiphany about his dull life, and in the 20 years after American Beauty's release it seems Hollywood experienced one as well. This gritty, stylish and irreverent film is a shift from previous decades and the typical way that major studios do business.

Lester experiences a series of shocks that he surprisingly takes in stride; fired from his job, cuckolded by his wife Carolyn, taunted by his teen daughter Jane, and more. Fantasy comes to the rescue for him in the form of Jane's friend Angela. While his world and the people around him crumble, Lester aims to live up to Angela's positive impressions of him and prove it is never too late to get it back.

American Beauty impacted my life. After seeing it with my then wife Jennifer in 1999 in Arlington, Virginia, I vowed not to find myself in Lester's situation. It influenced me to be a park ranger even though it is ""McDonalds work"" to her.

Though many of the characters in American Beauty act trapped, some such as Lester begin to realize that it is useless to try to live as others think or demand you ought to live. When they cast aside the pressure and control they are greeted with hostility. ""You can't go around doing whatever you feel like,"" says one of the manipulators, ""there are rules in life."" But there is also so much beauty in the world, and Lester and those like him vow to immerse themselves in it.

American Beauty is an intriguing and artful portrait of suburban dysfunction and a middle-class underworld, but also inspiration for rising above circumstances. Compelling film techniques include falling flower petals, spotlighting, fantasy sequences, jarring music, mist, slow-motion, and more. Kevin Spacey(Lester) and Annette Bening (Carolyn) are perfectly cast. The film earned 25 times its estimated production cost ($350 billion, which is 120 times the entire budget of the agency I work for, the National Park Service). By non-Hollywood standards the film still is somewhat tame and I wish the film makers had been even more daring.",9
30 October 2011,Excellence...,"I saw this film many years ago and I remember it being rather great. As it came to the top of my list again I decided to give it another go and I'm very glad I did! It's better than great, it's truly excellent! I can't say I've enjoyed a film more in a very long time! Some extraordinary characters, brilliant performances and an excellent script combine to make up one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in the 1990's by far! But enough of my praise, here's a brief summary before I praise it some more.

Lester Burnham has a boring job and lives with his wife, Carolyn, and daughter, Jane, in sweet suburbia. Family life is far from happy for any of them; Carolyn is cold to Lester and he finds that hard to take. Jane doesn't find it easy to fit in and thinks her parents are freaks. She has one friend, Angela Hayes, who becomes an object of affection for Lester, much to Jane's disapproval. Things take a turn when teenager, Ricky Fits moves in next door with his repressive father, Col. Frank Fits, USMC and mother, Barbara. Ricky likes to film everything with his video camera and he eventually introduces himself to the Burnham's. He and his father are about to have a big impact on their lives, much bigger than any of them could have imagined. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be sending me away to an asylum (again).

Alongside a, now iconic, musical score by Thomas Newman, there is also a great collection of contemporary songs used in the film. Beautifully made with not one wasted scene, a rare thing these days. As far as performances go, well, nobody put a foot wrong. Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening played his wife Carolyn to a tee! Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes were all excellent! I must also give honourable mentions to; Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fits, USMC, Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, Allison Janney as Barbara Fits (I had forgotten she was in it), Scott Bakula as Jim Olmeyer, Sam Robards as Jim Berkley and Barry Del Sherman as Bard Dupree.

I think I liked this movie even more this time around. Since I started documenting the films I've watched, I've come to appreciate the filmmakers' art more and more. And I think it is because of this I have a greater appreciation when I see something that I can admire not only for how it makes me feel, but also for the skill of the people that put it out there. It's a film I would recommend to anyone that loves film, it is one of the best films I've seen this year and will easily make my top ten Highly recommended.

My Score: 9.3/10.

IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 358,207 votes at the time of going to press).

Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88/100 (based on 152 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",9
23 September 2011,"Very good, but not quite great","Re-watching American Beauty 11 years later, I must admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.

At the time of its release American Beauty was hailed as a masterpiece - it doesn't quite seem like one now. Rather, it's a good drama with some fantastic directorial work and some truly great moments, and a very humble movie at that. The fact that I don't consider it one of the top films of the 90's doesn't change the fact that its Best Picture Oscar was one of the best and gutsiest choices the Academy made that decade.",7

3 April 2023,A masterful exploration of the complexities of modern American life,"""American Beauty"" is a masterful exploration of the complexities of modern American life, directed by Sam Mendes and released in 1999. The film presents a provocative, multi-layered narrative that delves into the psychological and emotional lives of its characters, examining their struggles with identity, sexuality, and the pursuit of happiness.

At the center of the film is Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man played by Kevin Spacey, who has become disillusioned with his life and decides to shake things up by rebelling against his mundane job, unhappy marriage, and unfulfilling suburban lifestyle. Spacey's portrayal of Lester is a tour de force performance, bringing to life the character's sarcastic wit, seething anger, and poignant vulnerability.

Annette Bening delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife, who is struggling to maintain control over her family, career, and personal life. Thora Birch is outstanding as the couple's teenage daughter, Jane, who is grappling with her own insecurities and frustrations. And Wes Bentley shines as Ricky Fitts, a mysterious and troubled teenager who becomes involved with the Burnham family and unlocks a world of beauty and truth that they had previously ignored.

The film's themes are deep and multi-layered, touching on issues such as the pursuit of happiness, the emptiness of the American Dream, and the complexities of human relationships. The script, written by Alan Ball, is a marvel of narrative economy, weaving together multiple storylines and characters in a seamless and engaging way.

Mendes' direction is exceptional, using visual metaphors and symbolism to heighten the film's emotional impact. The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall is stunning, capturing the beauty and banality of suburban life with equal grace and precision.

In conclusion, ""American Beauty"" is a cinematic masterpiece that is as relevant and thought-provoking today as it was when it was released over two decades ago. With its complex characters, rich themes, and stunning performances, the film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates powerful, provocative cinema.",10
21 October 2006,"Thinly-conceived, but arrogantly brilliant...","Black comedy from screenwriter Alan Ball is alternately cynical and satirical as it examines life behind the Red Door in garden-filled suburbia. Unhappily married husband and father fantasizes about his teenage daughter's sexy girlfriend while his uptight real estate agent spouse has an affair with her mentor; meanwhile, their daughter gets to know the troubled youth next door, who has icy, dysfunctional parents so rigid they're like horrible cartoons. Overrated picture is thin--and so preconceived to be shocking that it seems rather embittered (although most audiences were not put off). Conrad Hall's Oscar-winning cinematography is exceptionally handsome and the cast is excellent (especially Kevin Spacey, who gives a slyly intricate Oscar-performance), yet the film is hampered by an over-ambitious third-act, unnecessary bursts of melodramatic nonsense (often with a sexual undercurrent), and smarmy vulgarities. Oscars also went to Sam Mendes for his direction, Ball for his original screenplay, and--incredibly--the film as Best Picture of the year. **1/2 from ****

3 March 2020,A multi-layered drama that can be re-watched again and again,"How chilling was each character's performance in this film? One thing that surprised me was the complexity of each character in the movie. No one was perfect and everyone was facing their own issues. How rare it is to have films explore that much.

4.5/5. A bit slow but deserves the fine rating.

17 February 2000,I'm afraid not.,"Can I please say, without contravening the IMDb guidelines, that this was a big, big disappointment, especially as the emotional response the film had generated had promised great things. For about two thirds of its length it works well enough as a rather obvious comedy, but the complacency of the acting, the caricaturing of its female characters, the diffident direction that never masters the hardly original script all disappoint. This sort of thing has been done with far more perceptively, and with far less pretension by the likes of Hitchcock, Sirk, Lynch or Burton (never mind the extraordinary RUSHMORE). The next time you've got an astonishing, life-affirming (that's a laugh! Facing up to adult problems too difficult?!), once in a lifetime film, make sure you do.

3 October 2018,Life changing movie,"This movie is deep. Amazing music, and it tells you about your life. THIS is how your life will end up being, you will live with regrets. You will wish that you would have done something different. You will wish that you could go back in time and change things. Maybe it is not too late to change things, but at the same time maybe your fate is already sealed and there is nothing left for you but death. You only gonna live once, so remember that good times don't last forever. High School life is just a part of your life, a small part. It will end and you will never see those jocks again. Those football players will end up working at the local mill making $10.00 an hour, and spend their time telling people about the glory days of high school.

This movie is made for those people who survive high school, and is now living a successful life.

17 May 2019,"Overrated. Spacey is good, as always.","This should not be in the top 100 movies of all time. The acting is good but it's not even Kevin Spacey's best. The plot is often forced and many characters are left undeveloped. The dialogue is so-so. Anyone that calls this a 10 or the best movie of all time is likely pretentious or dumb. Perhaps they want to be deep but just don't actually know what is or isn't deep. Also the score is downright terrible.

3 April 2004,"VERY overrated, stereotypical, artsy NONSENSE!","Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.

American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.

Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.

Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.

Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.

What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.

In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.

Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""

Look closer.

8 March 2016,American Beauty,"Being a big fan of David Lynch, I quite enjoy a movie that is a little ""off"". Having a political science degree, I definitely enjoy a movie that deals with deep issues like society and expectations. Sam Mendes' 1999 Best Picture winner embodies all of the above aspects that I like. About 20 minutes into this film, I was certain I was going to enjoy it. I wasn't wrong.

American Beauty highlights one suburban family's struggle with cultivating the normality that is expected of theirs, and every other family in America. The perfect house and lawn, the successful parents with good jobs, the well-adjusted high school teenager. There is just one problem with this picture--it doesn't exist. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate agent vying for top spot in her market against a good looking competitor sweeping the field. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) makes a decent living in a job he hates increasingly more with each passing day. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the disillusioned youngest daughter in the house, struggling to fit in at school and eager to start her life. When a run-in with one of Jane's friends sets Lester headlong into a mid- life crisis, each weave of the Burnham family's seemingly perfect life comes unstitched.

The overarching theme of this movie deals with the question, what is normal? The fact is, that answer is different for each individual. We see three different variations of normal just in the Burnham's neighborhood, let alone outside their block. Expecting life to come together into the cookie-cutter image you've expected since you were cognizant of your place in the world just isn't reality. Unfortunately, many people don't understand that false reality and attempt, for far too many years of their life, to create what they've always expected. True liberation comes with learning to be yourself. For that reason alone, you should make time for American Beauty. Oh yeah, and Kevin Spacey.",7
6 April 2016,Hilariously Interesting,"American Beauty is a romantic comedy that doesn't suck, which is a nice break. It follows a man stuck in an unhealthy relationship with his wife and eventually falls in love with his 16-year-old daughter's best friend. It's an unconventional love story, and it's done beautifully.

The plot is great. It's presented in a very comedic way and it's actually very funny. It's interesting and realistic, which is a little surprising, but nothing ever felt out of place. The subplot is also very good, and while I think we've all seen it before I think that it was the more relatable and serious of both plots, which created a really nice balance of both fun and seriousness.

The characters are quite good too. You have a good idea of who they are, and they aren't horribly far-fetched either. All of them were flawed people, but not so flawed and that they were obviously fake. A lot of them, especially Kevin Spacey's character, were very likable as well.

Like I already said, the movie is very funny. But all the humor is done in a very natural way. During character conversations they might say something funny, but it's part of the conversation and further develops their character as well as furthers the conversation, so it exists as more than just a joke.

Overall American Beauty is fantastic. The plot and subplot are very good, the characters are great, and it's incredibly funny without feeling forced. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie, so long as you're willing to be wowed.",9
5 April 2000,American Beauty isn't,"At the end of this film, Kevin Spacey's character talks about the idea of one's life passing before one's eyes at the point of death. If such a phenomena is true, then I fervently pray that, at the moment of my demise, the two-plus hours I sat in the theatre watching this dreadful movie will be omitted by the Great Film Editor in the Sky. I knew as I left the theatre, long before the awards, that this movie would win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's EXACTLY the sort of condescending, self-important tripe that Hollywood likes to honor. Both ""The Insider"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were superior movies. I'm no genius, but I demand that a movie be smarter than I. I knew every plot ""twist"" five minutes before it happened, only erring on when Lester would be killed, but not by whom. Unbelievably stereotyped characters. Not particularly funny. I guess that because Lester beats off in the shower or lusts after an underage girl, we are supposed to think this movie is worthy of praise. I wonder how many people would praise the movie if Lester had lusted after an underage BOY? The ONLY good scene was the film within the film -- lovely and poetic. But one scene does not a good movie make, let alone a Best Picture. ""American Beauty"" is nothing more than an extended sitcom (though one that would only be shown on HBO). An utter waste of time. The Hollywood marketing machine has pulled off another cultural coup.",1
24 March 2005,A Triumph,"In the world of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)everything truly sucks. Lester is a mid-forty magazine writer. His wife is an unsuccessful Realtor and his daughter is secluded, strange girl planning on running a way. Soon Lester finds himself in a midlife crisis, his wife in an affair, and his daughter in a relationship with the pot smoking neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley).

But instead of Lester becoming depressed, he blackmails his boss and quits his job, goes to work for a fast food chain and buys the car of his dreams. lester is having the time of his life. But after a while, Ricky's father Col. Frank Fits (Chris Cooper) begins to notice somethings up with his son and Lester.

The movie intertwines all the characters introduced into a well-rounded drama/comedy masterpiece. Spacey is excellent as a mid-life crisis father in love with his daughters best friend and trying to take hold of his life. Benning does a fine job as his wife and Bentley as the drug lord, teenage neighbor.

The movie is a little different and your say after seeing this ""Wow!"" or ""What the f***!"" The movie holds a very deep message, one that can only be seen when watching it.

American Beauty. Starring: Kevin Spacey. Annette Benning, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Thora Birch. 5 out of 5 Stars.",10

4 February 2003,I Mean Hello What`s The Fuss ?,"AMERICAN BEAUTY is good in some ways but its portrayal of American stereotypes is laughably unfunny . It`s almost a satire of a parody : Pathetic shmuck of a father , frigid wife , dope smoking lolita , a couple of gay neighbours . I mean hello ! MARRIED WITH CHILDREN and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD not mention hundreds of grunge rock videos were doing this stuff ten times better years earlier . The only person to think this is a real slice of American pie is Osama Bin Laden . These American stereotypes really suck man . Whatever

The cinematography is beautiful as is the incidental music and the ending is very haunting but there is no way the film deserved the praise lavished on it , AMERICAN BEAUTY was standing at number 2 in the IMDb top 250 film rankings at one point ! Can you believe that man ? And there is a very simple explanation for the reason that it swept the oscars that year - 1999 was a very poor year for films . Go figure

5 December 2000,This is what won Best Picture?,"I know I'm a little outnumbered here, but this is one of the most boring and overrated films I have ever seen. This is the winner of Best Picture, along with being said that it is one of the best movies of all time? How exactly is this possible?

When I had seen the trailer for American Beauty, I immediately wanted to see the film. I'm the kind of person who waits for the movie to come out on video, so I can view it at my own speed because I usually like to watch parts of it more than once to get the full understanding of them. I had heard so much about the movie, and after it racked up the Oscars, I was forced to rent it. I did and boy, was I ever disappointed.

What is so great about it? So it's a tale about a man who is unhappy with his life and decides to change it in many ways. My life isn't exactly the most perfect, and at times, I too would like to change something about it. Everybody probably does. If I wrote my thoughts down on paper along with some characters and intelligent writing, do you think that I could sell it to a production company?

Let's discuss this movie in sections. The actors did a well job with the parts they were given. I'll admit that Kevin Spacey portrayed Lester Burnham in an excellent way and deserved the Oscar that he earned. Annette Bening made a disaster of her character, Carolyn. I thought that in every scene she was in, she tried to steal the show. Her character's story and problems were kind of bland if you compare them to Lester's. I was so glad to see that the Best Actress award didn't go to Annette for her ridiculous role. Thora Birch, who I have always liked, did a very good but not terrific job as Jane Burnham. Her character is complex and that was about the only thing I liked about this film. It does a pretty good job of describing what a teenager is like. The stuck-up Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari was the worst part of American Beauty. All I wanted to do was slap her, which was good because the character really spoke to the audience. I didn't like anything about the lines or actions she said/did. Wes Bentley was all-right but I didn't like his character and thought that the movie would have been a lot better off without his story line. I realize that it would have left out a ton of significant situations and plots to each character, but I don't know, it really didn't fit into the Burnham's problems.

Why was the plot and main idea given such rave reviews? Hard times after another came for the always depressed and suffering Lester Burnham. Yeah, yeah, the poor guy realizes that his life is pathetic and then his wife and daughter also have some problems. ALMOST everybody goes through mid-life crisis, but for some reason, this guy really stood out. Why?

The different problems that the characters go through are quite interesting, yet very odd. Carolyn's affair, Jane's encounter with the boy next door, Lester's obsession with Angela, smoking pot, working out, etc., etc., etc., were all amusing and entertaining to watch.

Perhaps, the thing I liked most about American Beauty was the conclusion. The whiplash ending happened fast and probably caught everybody else off guard. Finally, American Beauty was put to rest. (Well in my house anyways.)",1
23 November 2000,Beautiful,"American Beauty is a great movie about beauty. Everything you see in this movie is beautiful, even those which seem ugly. Kevin Spacy acts Lester character delicately and beautifully. The script is so powerful containing great dialogues mixed with remarkable scenes. Some scenes are unforgettable. for instance, the scene in which Ricky shows the most beautiful thing he had ever filmed. This scene is so touching. In fact, the whole movie is touching. I felt every characters in the movie. And at last, the name of the movie is some kind of a metaphor. Because American Beauty is the name of the variety of hybrid rose.(according to Webster Dictionary) Spielberg has found a new talent again(Sam Mendes) and of course Sam has done a great job for his movie directing debut. The film deserved to gain 100 oscars instead of one for best picture. Thanks to Alan Ball and all who were involved in making this special and beautiful movie.

11 April 2022,"Underrated still, even thought it is still rated high.","The imdb description doesn't even skim the surface of what this film is really about.

The plot twists are next to none. Nothing is predictable and everything makes you think something you may never have considered before. The deep meaning cast into this story is incredible. A must watch film in everyone's lifetime.
