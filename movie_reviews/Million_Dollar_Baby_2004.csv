17 May 2008,It Doesn't Get Better Than This,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

21 August 2010,Superb!,"Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!

About a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. 'Million Dollar Baby' begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn't imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner!

Eastwood's understanding to the subject is objective and that's biggest plus point. Tom Stern's Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox's editing is razor-sharp.

In the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood's performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F. O'Byrne is passable.

On the whole, the list of accolades this 2004 flick received is truly unprecedented. It's got a legendary tag. From this writer, Thumbs Up!",8
20 March 2005,A Punch In The Stomach,"I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",9

8 January 2006,Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!,"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby.""

My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.

In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.

While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort.",8
28 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby Is A Knockout!,"Clint Eastwood always explores the darker side of human nature and the duality of man. His dark hero of Unforgiven, William Munny, tries to repent only to be thrust back into that violent world he knows so well. His regretful Frank Horrigan of In The Line Of Fire and his womanizing Steve Everett of True Crime also want redemption.

Eastwood's Frankie Dunn of Million Dollar Baby is the most conflicted, weathered, and vulnerable he's ever played. When he weeps in a darkened church it's like watching a house of cards begin to fall. This is a man whose had a regretful past and can't run away from the curve balls life has thrown at him. Frankie Dunn is like most of us where we eventually get punished for our good deeds.

The funny thing is that Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie despite the way it's being advertised like a female version of Rocky. Yes, Hilary Swank's Maggie trains to be a boxer under the guidance of Clint Eastwood's Frankie Dunn. Yes, Morgan Freeman is Scrap, Frankie's tough friend and ex boxer. Yes, the bulk of it takes place in a boxing gym. Yes, there are numerous boxing matches. Despite all this it's still not a boxing movie.

When you see it you'll be surprised by the utter humanity in the piece. This film runs very deep and you will care for the three main characters. Eastwood gives us something we rarely get in films today. He gives us real people.

The film is about the triumph of the human spirit, the emotional world we try to hide from that eventually sucks us all in, our compassionate hearts, and the difficult decisions we face when it comes to those we care about. It's about friendship, trust, and the bonds of the heart that are unavoidable. It is a true masterpiece.

Hilary Swank is all fire and guts as Maggie. Her intensity and commitment has guided her to another Academy Award. She knows she's poor, she accepts it, and she pushes forward despite her limitations. This is not to say she can't be hurt. We watch her eyes well up a few times and truly feel her pain despite the fact that she is as tough as they come. Morgan Freeman, who finally won a long overdue and well deserved Oscar, plays Scrap with the perfect combination of toughness and compassion. He knows the situation from every angle and his narration of the film rings true.

See this film. It deserves it's accolades because it's about real characters and it's directed with honesty, warmth, and true pain. Clint Eastwood gets better with age and his films reflect the days of real movie making. The sets are simple, the characters are complex, and the story moves in a pace closer to real life than any other director could reach. Eastwood has been called the Hemingway of Film making. You don't get more real than that. It was great seeing this natural storyteller take home his second Oscar for Best Director and Picture.",
15 April 2011,Swank gives the performance of a lifetime!,"I didn't view this film until today because I simply wasn't interested in women in boxing; however, I wish I'd seen it years ago! Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood's curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the ""voice of God"" in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won't spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it's unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood's and Swank's characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!

29 July 2005,Inspirational and hard-hitting*no pun intended*,"Of course, I must see ""THE BEST PICTURE OF 2004!"", I think every movie fanatic has too. Man, cry me a river, this was a good movie! I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.

Morgan Freeman is a remarkable actor. I'M SO HAPPY HE WON FINALLY! Even though I feel sometimes his roles are typical, he's the disrespected man, but has knowledge and helps people, he's really good at it.

I really enjoyed this movie, but just to let you know, it is a tear jerker. So you might want to have a box of Kleenex next to you. This is a wonderful film that everyone should watch. You'll feel better after you watch it, I know that sounds silly, but I'm sure that everyone else who watched it will agree with me.

30 January 2005,"Intoxicating, Brilliant, Inspirational, and Multi-Layered- what films are meant 2 B","Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film, one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it every time. I loved first and foremost its message that we create ourselves through our drive, loyalty, ambition, dedication, and work. Secondly, I love its insistence in the good of the American Dream, and I loved its excitement and beautiful, touching message toward the end. A movie about violence and ambition that evolves into a movie about love, hard-earned sacrifice, and doing something meaningful with one's life. Grade A entertainment with a beautiful message to boot! Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood should both win their second Oscars for their contribution to cinema.

20 December 2004,Loved The Ride,"Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.

I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was.",
16 December 2004,It's a knockout ...,"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade.",10
16 December 2004,Sure to be a contender for the Academy's Best Picture of the Year,"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.

25 January 2005,Lemon Pie and Yeats,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see ""Shawshank Redemption"").

As wonderful as Hilary and Morgan are, there is no doubt that this is Clint's (multi) million dollar baby. He directs and stars and writes the music. At almost 75 years old, he can still carry a picture, while not stealing scenes. Yes, the twist in this one smells a bit like a Hollywood chick-flick, but the talented director (Eastwood) never lets it sink to that level. This is a terrific film by a top-notch filmmaker. The story is interesting, funny, dramatic and heart-warming and the acting is truly first rate. Don't let the trailer or the thought of a boxing movie keep you away.",9
30 October 2005,Genuine emotions!,"Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.

The acting is as mentioned earlier very, very good. Clint chose to appear in this film himself as he does in many of the films he directs but there is something different about him this time around. Eastwood isn't known as a director who pours his soul out on the screen but in this film he seems to add a few emotions to his range of acting. He is still a tough guy as can be heard from his voice but he is also just a vulnerable old man with an estranged daughter. Its hard to write about his performance without spoiling the film so I'll just say this: This is his most well rounded character to date in spite of the fact that it seems a little far fetched that Eastwood would want to learn Gaelic. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance in this film and in my opinion it was well earned. She plays her character in a way so the character becomes almost instantly likable and you cannot help but root for her. This ability to draw the audience in and make them feel is very rare but Swank seems to have mastered it. Overall her performance is impressive. The last notable actor is of course Morgan Freeman who finally won his Oscar. He brings his usual authority and authenticity to the character and while he is ""only"" a supporting character in this film he definitely puts his signature on it with some very moving scenes. The rest of the cast is decent but as the emphasis is on the three mentioned above there is no reason to talk about them further.

The script is rather simple but its simplicity is a quality mark. The film takes you in one direction only to take a twist and turn into something completely different and as the audience had just gotten used to the direction the film was going the twist seems like a genuine shock. I'm not telling what the twist is you're just going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself. The dialog is both witty and intelligent and above all it seems real. Believable. And because of the first class acting it feels even better. When I say that the dialog seems real in fact I mean the entire film seems real. Genuine. Everything from the acting to the atmosphere is highly believable and real even though Swank's character's family and the character of Danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature.

The film really managed to draw me in and I felt with and for the characters of the film. The characters are the driving factor of the film and luckily the actors who portray them are skilled enough to make them seem real. Eastwood outdid himself in the drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one of his best. It doesn't seem fair to compare the film to Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as they are very different films in terms of genre and target group.

Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2004 and is deserving of the Oscar it received in the Best Film category as well as the other Oscars it was awarded.

25 April 2009,One of Clint Eastwood's Best Works,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
29 January 2005,A Spare and Gripping Character Study,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a spare, minimalist and gripping character study. Even the elements that now and then seem a bit extraneous, particularly about religious faith, turn out in the last few minutes to be vital.

Director/star/scorer Clint Eastwood confidently pares the film and his performance down to its simplest elements. Tom Stern's cinematography is even more breathtaking than their collaboration on ""Mystic River,"" especially in its use of darkness, and should have been recognized for an Oscar nomination. Paul Haggis's script recalls his ahead-of-its-time TV series ""E.Z. Streets,"" where the dialog is more for character development and revelations than for plot.

Particularly wonderful are the interchanges between Eastwood and Morgan Freeman that are lovely evocations of long-time male camaraderie. A key element of the film is its exploration of paternal aspects of masculinity we rarely see on film without a sexual context - friendship, mentoring and responsibility.

The film, however, is almost too bare in its treatment of Hilary Swank's character, with none of the personal context that ""Girl Fight"" stressed, particularly in the lack of any romantic hints at all -- is it to avoid any issues about the tomboy's sexuality? But this keeps the spotlight on the central, quasi father-daughter relationship with its emotionally draining conclusion that packs a tremendous wallop.

One of the few jarring notes is the stereotyped portrayal of her grasping hillbilly relatives, including an inconsistency or two about them.

Freeman's continuing narration simply got on my nerves, even if it is rationalized in the last frame, especially when it re-emphasized something we were seeing visually. I felt it was recalling his essential commentary in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" which is explicitly referenced in an amusing epithet.

The glaring product placement for Everlast and the gratuitous reference to a Warner Brothers product were unnecessary and cheapened a moving story.",

10 March 2005,"Oscar calibre, and yet","ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING

Coincidentally, both of the best pictures in this year's Oscar are about choosing death against life, although the circumstances are markedly different. The mood is even more polarised. In Mar adentro, I've never seen a story about death that has so much life that while deeply moved, I left the cinema elated and thankful. With Million Dollar Baby, I cannot remember ever leaving a cinema feeling so depressed.

Many describe the first half of the movie a ""Rocky"" type of uplifting story. Director Eastwood however is determined not to give people who are looking for usual Hollywood cheap thrills what they want. Resisting numerous opportunities to melodramatic magnifications, he tells the story in a simple old style and with minimalism. In addition, some detachment is gained through voice over narration of an observer (albeit not an entirely detached one) one-time great boxer and now janitor ""Scrap"" (Morgan Freeman). The final acceptance of late comer (over 30) Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) by trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to pugilistic training does bring an emotional stir but even that tends towards underplaying. Then, except for one bout in which Maggie has her nose broken, all her victories are covered in such rapidity that can almost be mistaken for carelessness. But make no mistake about it. That is exactly the way it is intended to be, so as not to take the focus away from the characters, and their interaction.

Scrap and Frankie is a pair that have been through a lot together, and have reached a point in their life when there's nothing that cannot be said between them. And it's not what is said, by the way they say it, that counts. The spark between Freeman and Eastwood provides some of the much-needed easy and humorous moods in this movie.

Scrap plays a role that is almost like a guardian angel to Maggie. There is not a great deal of interaction between them but whenever there is, he is always gentle and understanding. Morgan and Swank light up the perpectually gloomy screen in this movie with the warmth they radiate.

It is course on the interaction between Frankie and Maggie that this movie rests. Through the initial rejection, the gradual acceptance, the intense training and the eventual sharing of success, we see the development of a mentor/protégé relationship that is quite common, even when superbly acted. It's the abrupt and tragic turn of events in the middle that brings into focus the father/daughter relationship that has been fermenting all along. Not even descriptions such as ""heart-breaking"" can do justice to the emotional turmoil the audience experiences through the second half of the movie. The depth of the emotion intensifies as the agony portrayed by Eastwood and Swank towards the end pierce the air like a silent scream.

While Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly Oscar calibre in many respects, it is extremely depressing to watch. Final observation: here's a movie with absolutely no sex whatsoever (those who suggest otherwise may wish to consider consulting a psychiatrist), only one four-letter word (uttered, incidentally, by a priest), and a lot of guts in not trying to please the mass.",
23 February 2006,A Story of Redemption,"When you make a film with characters, true characters, you have won half the battle. The characters in this film are on a crash course with emptiness, until they find each other. The tired, stagnant life of the Clint Eastwood fight manager, Morgan Freeman, who has sold his needs to watch his friend, and, of course, Hillary Swank, who is trying to find someplace to keep her from ending up like her trailer trash family. If one were to simply look at the plot, it would seem pretty trite. Girl wants to be a fighter (a contemporary possibility; her gender really isn't important), manager hasn't had a fighter in years (he is a curmudgeon who sees the negative in things), and the talent will out. But then the element of tragedy rears its ugly head, and the plot becomes more complex. But it is the characterization that wins the day. We get to know and love these three people (actually a fourth; a young boxer who continues to get the crap beat out of him but who provides another example of what we should be. It is, of course, ultimately about love: love for self, love for others, and love for why we are put on this earth. I was really moved by this film. It is a masterpieces of redemption and will. It is about victory through pain.",9

22 December 2004,"Best boxing film since ""Raging Bull""?","Clint Eastwood is a man of faith. He is an artist who is confident and experienced enough to have a deep faith in the audience that he is trying to reach. He is also a master of omission, of the left-out detail/line, trusting in his gut that his audience is willing to participate in his films by exercising their imaginations; that they never want any aspect of the story to be 'dumbed-down' for ready consumption. In fact, his trust in the audience to use their own minds to fill in gaps is like a gift of part ownership in the film. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a beautiful gift, and a masterpiece if film-making.

Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (some we're in on, some not quite). His guilt/shame is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet, as played by Eastwood, you know Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice. Or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.

Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She's a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. But for my money, Maggie is this generation's Rocky. That may seem an easy, simplistic, and over-reaching comparison, but the parallels are deep, obvious and myriad. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove. The real life parallel of her relationship to Eastwood no doubt played a part in her ability to connect with the character's relationship to Dunn. Yet this in no way diminishes her accomplishment. She is brilliant.

Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right-hand man (Scrape) at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from ""Shawshank Redemption"". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together. I can think of nobody acting in film today who can embody kindness and wisdom through friendship and support better than Freeman. He also serves to bring in another Eastwood trademark – 'Banter'. Even when themes are heavy, Eastwood's sense of humor is never entirely absent and he and Freeman have a good time with each other, as did Bacon and Fishburne in ""Mystic River"". These three characters together create a beautiful and true, albeit small, family unit Eastwood's lifelong themes and 'blurring of lines' are on full display: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the role of violence, redemption, guilt/shame over previous acts, even god and death. Never one for easy answers, his version of the truth lies in the shadows, quite literally. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lies waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, then leaves us there to ponder. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a shadow play. As accomplished as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. As Bacon's character says in ""Mystic River"", ""and the hits just keep on comin'.""",
9 February 2005,"No, It Doesn't Work","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
15 August 2005,this truly packs a punch,"Calling ""Million Dollar Baby"" a boxing movie would be like calling ""Star Wars"" a space fantasy. Only ""Rocky"" has ever reached this quality. Hilary Swank gives a performance beyond what anyone could ever imagine as destitute waitress Maggie Fitzgerald, trying to make something of herself as a boxer. Clint Eastwood gives probably his best performance ever as trainer Frankie Dunn, trying to reassert his worth by training Maggie. Morgan Freeman is also amazing as co-trainer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, seeking a new direction in life.

Watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" you may end up feeling like you are in the middle of a boxing ring. Tough (but never gratuitously violent), disturbing (but never manipulating emotions), this elevates Hilary Swank to the level of Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep. Her and Morgan Freeman's Oscar wins were more than deserved (as for Best Picture, I was actually rooting for ""The Aviator""). But regardless of anything, no one can deny how great this movie is. 10/10.",10
5 February 2005,a knockout punch,"I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on ""Rawhide."" Who could have imagined, looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner, that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days, it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films, as the typecasting was even worse than it is today. But Clint did it.

Unfortunately for me, I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater. Because of the staggered release of MDB, it was almost impossible not to. I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot.

That being said, I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams, courage, and the true meaning of family.

The three principals did a tremendous job. Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress. She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character. There is never anything overdone in her work. She is one of the finest actresses we have. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have. And Clint Eastwood? Well, he's just one of the finest directors we have. Congratulations, Rowdy.",9
13 January 2007,Cauliflowered,"I've been watching films deeply enough to develop a strategy of trust. There are certain persons that if they are involved in a film, I'll go into it with an open soul. Often they'll fail but thats a small cost in an otherwise rewarding life of trust. There are only a few actors on this list, some writers of course and directors.

And there's another list of people to avoid, people who have damaged my soul and compromised my world, folks who require you to repair your encounter with them. I avoided this project until now because it has both types. Swank is an earnest actor not on either list.

Eastwood is someone who has earned my trust because of one amazing project, ""Mystic River."" Quite apart from the story, it is about direction, a melding of forces. All the major actors in the thing are actors who also direct. All of them understand to a significant degree what most actors don't, that a performance has both inside and outside compositional values. What Eastwood wrangled in that little film was an encounter not only among characters as scripted, and among acting philosophies as often happens, but also among actors situation in what they see as the directorial situation the local composition. And we also have the interaction of all layers with the others. Marvelous, and worthy of trust.

Plus the man is so economical. Economy by itself isn't worth much; Bresson chafes me. But Eastwood can focus and pare so that even the most ordinary effect can seem purposeful. And that's what happens here. This is such an ordinary, derivative, spitefully mundane and worthless script, it says something that he has given it dignity. But that's all it is, tripe with a clean wrapper.

The two men on my list that do not deserve a place in my pantheon of film friends: Freeman and Haggis.

Haggis is a hack, a machine, a cut and paste expert in appealing to the lowest and most uncomplicated sentimentalites. That's allowable in my book so long as there's some novelty, some new handle on life some new angle, something that pulls us up with tools for seeing. Never.

Freeman is simply an annoyance. He's an arrogant actor exploiting black avuncular type. He decided long ago and has often said that he will just be himself, regardless of what the role requires. But that never comes up because he only chooses roles that match what he has chosen to invent himself as a person. Its a fake racist nobility, made ever so more offensive with the fake wisdom that accompanies it.

I'll take a hundred Eddie Murphys exploring the limits of race over one who safely cashes in on it. Listen to his narrative phrasing in the voiceovers. Eastwood should have known better.

Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",
25 September 2005,The story of life in the trenches,"It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that ""Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee."" Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a ""boxing movie."" The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me. In that, it succeeded beyond all imagination and I plan to watch it again.

16 January 2005,A film about boxing is not really about it at all.,"A film about boxing is not really about it at all. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is more about a father Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) dealing with an estranged daughter and about the same crusty trainer facing an aggressive young female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The intersection of Frankie's personal and professional lives is deftly drawn in the parallel plots.

Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) narrates, as Freeman does so well in Shawshank Redemption, about Frankie's boxing gym, where Freeman, a former boxer and best friend of Frankie, works and lives. Freeman has the right melancholic but authoritarian voice, the kind Michael Caine uses so well in Cider House Rules that relays acceptance of fate with a generous supply of humanity. Frank quietly endures boxers leaving him for a better chance, old age, and the importuning of young boxers who wants a chance at success. Along with Maggie comes a trailer-park family that tests Frankie's essentially peaceful nature, one nurtured by reading Gaelic.

Director Eastwood's style is minimalist, essentially a three-person drama set in spare locales like the clean and uncluttered gymnasium. Although not black and white, the color film plays down color to give it a '40's film noir feeling. Cinematographer Tom Stern (chief lighting technician for Road to Perdition) uses dark and light shadows like a 16th century portrait painter. At times I thought I was watching Hopper's diner come alive with these marginal but never dull characters.

While the dialogue is rarely poetic, it is muscular in its spareness, just enough to get the point across. With weathered faces like Eastwood's and taut beauty like Swank's, not much more is needed but a close-up camera and editing to reduce the fat to that muscle. When Maggie from southwest Missouri describes the life she left, the language is tough poetry: ""I might as well go back home and buy a used trailer and get a deep fryer and some Oreos."" I was drawn into the drama far more than any other film of 2004, because the story was common but powerful and the Oscar-worthy performers reached the right notes, and not a note more. The best picture of '04 by a knockout.",
18 August 2005,"""Overrated""? Nope. It really is one of the year's best films.","A lot of people were disappointed by Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (at least those I talked to) and said it didn't live up to the critical hype.

I was one of the few who wasn't disappointed and felt it was as good as its reputation would lead one to believe. When ""Million Dollar Baby"" came around, I knew it was a film I wouldn't want to miss.

I used to/occasionally box and this film doesn't really capture the training struggle that ""Rocky"" did. Like ""Raging Bull,"" it's more of a character study set against a backdrop of sports. (""Rocky"" was, too, but of the three, it was the most sports-heavy.) ""Baby"" isn't really a ""sports"" movie, it's all about characters. It works very well.

Eastwood's direction is superb. I don't know if his performance was Oscar-worthy, but then again, I don't recall Clint ever crying (at least so convincingly) in any of his other films.

Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank both deliver great performances. It's a really fine film, a well-told story and a heartbreaking character study.

If you liked ""Mystic River,"" you'll love this.",9
30 January 2005,My brief review of the film,"A powerful boxing film, it is such a good watch because it goes much deeper than just being about boxing. It is very deeply involving and gripping, and it is likely to even encapsulate viewers not interested in the sport. Swank is excellent but it is the acting from Eastwood that stands out the most, full of realistic emotion in this gritty, authentic tale he has filmed. The film nevertheless is imperfect, outstaying its welcome, having a few medical flaws and some real weaknesses in the plot. It is perfect viewing otherwise however and such a potent experience too insomuch that the flaws of the film do not detract very much. It is just a shame that this film cannot be discussed much further without telling how it ends. It deserves to be talked about.

9 September 2005,beautifully realized drama,"The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.

Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his ""clients."" The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world. Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena. Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on ""a girl"" for training purposes. But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes. The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.

Even though ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film. His narration (as it did also in this summer's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.

Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies. And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama. Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast. As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here. Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next. Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future. In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of naïve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life. And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years. Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a cliché-ridden tale into a work of art.

Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date.",9
10 February 2005,"A Deeply Disturbing,Haunting, And Depressing Boxing Film, And It May Just Be The Best Film I Have Ever Seen!","This is going to be very hard for me to review but i will do my best. A Deeply Disturbing, and depressing,boxing movie, and it may just be the best film i have ever seen!. The Performances, are incredible, just incredible,, and all 3 of them deserve Oscars, especially Swank!. It's Moving, touching, disturbing and extremely sad. You grow so attached to Swank's character, since she is so incredibly likable, and what happens to her is not right!. Hillary and Clint's Chemistry is simply amazing, they had a special bond,as for Maggie's Mother, You will hate her, , and want to slap her silly, for being such a bitch. However it depressed me big time, and it's not easy to watch (2nd half anyway). there are lots and lots of disturbing images, that will haunt you , trust me., In fact The whole 2nd half is haunting. The Direction is absolutely, incredible. Clint Eastwood, is brilliant behind the camera, nothing fancy, but the film does not need it, still it's brilliant, all the way!.And that score, is simply awesome!. The Acting Is absolutely incredible,with No Doubt Oscar winning performances from, Swank, Eastwood,Freeman. Hillary Swank, gives one of the best performances, ever!, she is so incredibly likable, i have never grown, so attached to a character before, she's so adorable, lovable, and what happened to her, it tore me up,however i don't want to ruin the film so that's all i will say.However it is indeed one of the finest performances ever in a movie. Clint Eastwood, is just as good, he is an incredible actor, his character is meant to be rough, and gruff, but he really has a heart of a gold and i enjoyed the special bond/chemistry him and Hillary had.Morgan Freeman is absolutely, fantastic here as always, and was a great narrator, plus, i loved his character. Jay Baruchel, is good as Danger, and was harmless, plus he gave me a few good chuckles. Lucia Rijker, plays one of the most despicable, pieces of trash i have ever seen, she did her job extremely well, but i just wanted to strangle her(literally). Margo Martindale did her job extremely well as the hate able, uncaring mother. Overall , i was simply, blown away by this movie, and it's one of the best movies i have ever seen!, There is absolutely no excuse, for you not to see this film! , i have never been affected by a movie this much! . ***** out of 5",10

9 January 2005,exquisite and delicate work of art,"Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.

Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesn't let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Don't let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by ""should have been"" remarks. This million dollar baby is really worth every single buck...",10
19 February 2005,Quite simply a knock out,"Clint Eastwood is a unique icon of American cinema whom I have admired even before he reached the big screen when I enjoyed his performances as Rowdie Yates in television's ""Wagon Train"". The longevity of his career (the first of his films as an actor was years 50 ago), the commercial success of his 58 films as an actor (whether as cowboy, cop or comedian) but, above all, the critical success of the 27 movies he has directed (especially the later work such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"") make him a singular figure in the cinematic firmament. In many cases, he has both starred and directed and so it is with ""Million Dollar Baby"" which - at the incredible age of 74 - is set to consolidate his already formidable reputation.

I went into the cinema expecting to see ""Rockette"" - a female version of Stallone's triumphalism in the boxing ring - but came out feeling I'd seen ""Who's Fight Is It Anyway?"" - a searing examination of the meaning of life and relationships. Eastwood, as the laconic and irascible boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, and Hilary Swank, as a 32 year old trailer trash waitress who wants to find herself in the ring (she put on 19 lb for the role), are individually commanding but, in their subtle interaction, they are most impressive, as she finds the father who died too early and he connects with the daughter who will not receive his letters.

The third character is a friend to each and the one who understands both from the beginning. Morgan Freeman plays Frankie's assistant Scrap in a dual role in which he is also - as he was in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - the mellow-voiced and knowing narrator. Unusually for this type of movie, a considerable amount of time is focused on the training gym and the actual fight scenes are very different from ""Rocky"": fast, furious, and short. Indeed the fighting is essentially a metaphor for feelings and the whole work is simply a knock out.",

24 March 2015,Three excellent central performances elevate a clichéd story,"Clint Eastwood must have gotten soft in his old age. While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and cliché dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly (""I don't train girls"") takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has ""it"" in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre clichés.",6
10 October 2020,Old fashioned boxing story with a modern twist,"Eastwood plays the owner of a gym where fighters train. Hillary Swank is a 31 year old waitress trying to become a fighter. At first Eastwood discourages her due to her age and lack of technique, but soon he is training her and she starts to have some success. The relationship becomes much more than that of a trainer and fighter as she takes the place of the daughter who won't speak to him and he takes the place of her family that only cares about what's in it for them. A tragedy occurs that causes Swank to ask Eastwood for a favor he feels he cannot grant.

This won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2004, but there is nothing particularly unique or compelling about it that would have caused it to beat out its competition in the Oscar race that year other than the fact that it circumstantially paralleled another story that was making headlines at the same time that the academy was voting - that of Terry Schiavo and the Herculean efforts by first the state of Florida, then the president and Congress, at keeping Terry's feeding tube from being removed when she had likely been in a vegetative state for fifteen years. The incident caused lots of people to write medical directives so that they could lessen the chance of becoming a medical wishbone and political football themselves.",6

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",
26 April 2005,long live Clint Eastwood!,"Hardly one year after the shady ""Mystic River"" (2003), ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood changes mood and perseveres with ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), an unusual film about women's boxing which presents none sign of quieting down from the former cowboy and ""dirty Harry"". He once said about his movies that they had to be before all: entertaining and compelling. Given the commercial and critical enthusiasm of his work, he well fulfilled his pledges.

On the paper, ""Million Dollar Baby"" nearly looks like any success story, a genre that American cinema has a liking for. Maggie Fitzerald (Hilary Swank) is a 31 year-old woman who works as a waitress in a restaurant. Perfectly aware that her life isn't much worth, she only sees boxing to find a way in life. With the help of an old coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and after weeks of intense training, she knows a meteoric rise with fame and glory under her belt. But Clint Eastwood is a too demanding author to content himself to shot this kind of story and is ready to go beyond it to get more interested in the relationship between Maggie and his character Frankie. As a matter of fact, ""Million Dollar Baby"" diverts codes of the boxing world and success story to develop a touching friendship story between two opposite characters that will peak in the last wrenching third of the film. One the one hand, Maggie Fitzerald, ready to do anything to become the best woman boxing. She sees in Frankie Dunn, the perfect coach and eventually a father figure to enable her to reinforce her trust in herself. On the other hand, Frankie Dunn, an irascible old man whose life has especially been a series of disappointments and who tries to find a hope in redemption (I think the somewhat dreary scenery of the gymnasium reflects well his temper). But in reality, he hides a golden heart and perceives Maggie as the daughter he hasn't had but would have liked to. To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely friendship, Eastwood uses pure film-making basics: a straight-forward narrative line, lovable characters and a calm directing without exaggerations. The whole is tinged with a huge tenderness and a humor of quality to which it is impossible to resist. And just like in ""Unforgiven"" (1992), to hear a few guitar notes is better than a whole classical music orchestra.

A new variation of the American dream, a praise to courage and perseverance, a just description of the boxing world, a poignant father-daughter relationship. ""Million Dollar Baby"" combines all these things. With this monument of emotion, Clint Eastwood is really at the peak of his art. It probably won't be his last movie but one thing is sure: by getting old, he improves and currently shots better than ever. It's simple, genuine and moving cinema at its best and no wonder it seduced the jury at the Oscars ceremony earlier this year by awarding it 4 Oscars including best actress (Hilary Swank) and best director (Clint Eastwood).",10
6 February 2005,The non-glorification of boxing!,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. He has reversed the thinking from old school Hollywood that violence is glorious. 'Unforgiven' was the anti-western masterpiece showing that old west America wasn't just about the guys in the black and white hats and it was the film that defined Eastwood as a director. 'Million Dollar Baby' shows that Clint is making the best movies of his career over the last 15 years. Unlike 'Rocky' where the fight is uproarious as you cheer and the hero gets the girl in the end, 'Million Dollar baby' shows how ugly boxing violence is and why the sport has degenerated into a low brow competition in recent years.

Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deserve Oscars for this film as their performances are raw, heartfelt and just plain worthy. Eastwood also deserves his second Oscar as best director and this film is superior, yes, superior I say to Martin Scorsese's over rated 'Raging Bull' from 1980. Made on a relatively low budget with no special effects, just the good old fashioned elbow grease that Hollywood use to consume itself in, 'Million Dollar Baby' might be the best picture of 2004 for its message as well as for its creative talents.

11 January 2005,Excellent,"The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert.

6 March 2005,Clint does a wagner number,"Clint Eastwood and Mary Shelley may not seem to have a lot in common, but both have a dab hand at Gothic Romance  dark stories of wish-fulfilment in which the central characters battle Fate, and lose, but do so heroically. Wagner wrote operas around such themes. Here, Clint has taken his text from the obscure ""F X Tool"", a former boxing trainer and ""cut man"", who published one well-received book of boxing short stories. ""Rope Burns"" when he was nearly seventy. Here, aging, never quite has-been Frank against his better judgment takes on enthusiastic woman boxer Maggie, who though past 30 is aching to succeed, despite being a self-admitted piece of trailer trash. Maggie of course is literally a knockout and goes from strength to strength  until she comes up against the Bear, the meanest female fighter in the world. And then we flip over into almost a different story about the testing of faith.

There is plenty of moody, gloomy photography and some fine boxing sequences (the Bear is played by a real women's boxing champion). Boxing is not my favourite sport but you do get to appreciate its attraction for those who are good at it. The lamentable thing is that so many derive real pleasure from watching. But as I said the movie is not really about boxing as about a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds, or the fates, if you will.

There are only three characters of any real consequence, Frank, Maggie and Frank's sidekick Eddie, who provides a mordant commentary on the story. Frank, as played by Clint is gnarled and tough, yet not quite tough enough. Guilt-ridden, he grieves for his estranged daughter and Maggie fills the gap. Hilary Swank as Maggie, despite the deprivation and loneliness, is all brighteyed ambition. We are never allowed to dwell on the improbability of such a character; instead we nod approvingly as she storms into Frank's twilight years, batters opponents senseless and gets into the ring for the big one. It's a remarkable performance and Hilary might as well have the Oscar, in a lean year. Morgan Freeman is very comfortable as Eddie the commentator in what is almost a repeat of his performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

The trouble with Gothic Romance is that we know from the start that the protagonists are going to fail no matter how hard they try. Their failing is not a function of some fatal flaw in their make-up, but because the Universe is against them. Failure is thus reassuring. Clint however points out that this should not stop us from trying. Maggie at least gave it her best shot. For her, the ride was worth it. .",
6 January 2014,Clint Eastwood turns in another great movie,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old hand at training. His latest fighter (Anthony Mackie) doesn't have the heart and he's reluctant to get him the championship shot. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a self professed white trash. She scrounge enough money for the gym, but Frankie refuses to train her because she's too old. She won't give up, and with the help an old retired fighter Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), she convinces Frankie to give her a chance.

This is a great standard underdog sports story for 3/4 of the movie. It works great. Clint and Morgan are old hands at this. They cancel each other a bit with their grumbling voices and their gruff demeanor. Hilary Swank is perfect for the role. She's no princess. She can definitely play the hungry white trash role.

Then the last 30 minutes turn dark. It's a change in tone. It has difficult things to say. If it could be edited down, it could be even better. After the big climatic fight, the final ending takes a little too long. But that's a minor pacing problem in an otherwise compelling great movie.",8
9 January 2005,How can a movie or a cast be any better?,"2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and I. Million Dollar baby is a sure fire Acadamey Award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win. Everything about this movie from the writing, directing, acting and even the music by Clint Eastwood is brilliant. Hillary Swank is once again one of our best actresses.. Don't know why she doesn't make more movies and do some as a ""real lady"" which she certainly is. Her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role. The chemistry between her and the fabulous Clint Eastwood who I believe is past 70 years old is wonderful. Clint is simply great in anything that he does, from those old spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry to the comedies, acting, directing, singing, you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else. He is a fall back to the greats of Hollywood goneby. What can you say about Morgan Freeman. I can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied. He is mesmerizing with his tones. As an actor, he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting. He is one of the finest actors in Hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber. He is great as the go between with Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank in this movie and he does it with such ease. I would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves.",9

29 January 2005,Coping with Elevated Expectations,"It's always difficult to be objective about a film like Million Dollar Baby. It's winning all the awards and getting lots of tens. When I walk into a theater to see something like this, the flick is already competing with Citizen Kane and Gone With the wind (or in this case Raging Bull and Somebody Up There Likes Me) rather than Kangaroo Jack or the Ghosts of Edendale.

I tend to become hyper-critical on such occasions which negatively affects my ability to sustain disbelief. Since I am a boxing historian, this tendency particularly pervades my perception of boxing movies all of which seem way too fake and over-simplified as compared to the sport itself.

One time I was covering a fight for Ring magazine and I walked into the dressing room where a manager was trying to force his fighter's fists into a pair of thumb-less gloves.A ruling had recently been passed in New York that preliminary fighters must wear thumb-less gloves as a measure to reduce eye injuries. This fighter had never even seen a pair of thumb-less gloves until five minutes before he was supposed to go into the ring against a local betting favorite. The scene in that dressing room ( ""I ain't wearing those f------ things"") was far more dramatic than anything I've ever seen in a boxing film and these guys weren't even in the ring yet.

So boxing films can best be viewed as metaphors and as metaphors they can not be taken literally. Only in movies do fighters score one punch first round knockouts over and over again. Only in movies do fighters foul as obviously and flagrantly as do the heavies in the movies. On an on and on.

So I'm sitting in the theater, aware of the maudlin, manipulating nature of the metaphor. I'm sort of rolling my eyes at the phoniness of it all, the clichés, the straight from Of Mice and Men story about Axel the Dog and the foreshadowing implicit within the tale. The too familiar technique of Morgan Freeman voice over. Certainly, our nation's critics couldn't be falling for this crap could they? And then, somehow, I too began to fall for it. I gave up the resistance which was futile anyway.

I started pulling for Swank, the actress and Eastwood the director.Let's face it, Eastwood passed John Wayne as the the most iconic of American actors about five years ago and now he takes his place with Scorcese amongst our best directors and here he is playing an old man with no intention of getting the girl. At this point, I'm rooting for Clint more than ever and I've always been on his side ever since the days of Rowdy Yates in Rawhide.

Freeman, yeah, we've sen this before too but ya know what? The reason we see it so often is because it works. I don't know what the thing with ""Danger"" was all about but even that worked sorta.

And Swank. Top of her game.I'll be a fan forever.

By the end, I forgot about the thumb-less gloves and the career of Clint and Glory and Insomnia and everything else except that I was sitting in a movie theater watching a great movie with my wife and daughter and all three of us were getting something from the film, something different for each of us, something we won't be able to articulate but may come back someday and provide us with courage and resilience in the clutch when we're on the ropes.",
19 December 2018,"Female ""Rocky"" with a downbeat and contradictory close","Released in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Eastwood as a cantankerous boxing trainer who owns a working class gym in Los Angeles, which is maintained by one of his former boxers, the narrator of the story (Morgan Freeman). A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she's too old at 32 and he ""doesn't train girls,"" probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.

The bulk of the film is basically a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it's touching.

The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I 'get' the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what's (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul. Nevertheless, it's a dark turn that leaves a sour taste because it refutes the positive message of the first two-thirds of the story.

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

13 November 2009,simply terrific,"I watched this awesome movie last night on TV, and I could not stop crying for half an hour: its greatness and emotional power are really something rare and precious. It is simply incredible how the genius of Clint Eatwood was able to go beyond the physical violence of a boxing story and make it an astonishing metaphor of life. The mysterious and simple truth about life and death are so plainly but deeply concentrated in two hours.

Respecting and protecting yourself, distinguishing between the moment you have to fight and the one you have to wait, searching for the great shot of a lifetime, always recognizing one's limits, suffering till the utmost to prove one's strength, standing up after being knocked down but accepting defeat as part of life, enjoying success, but realizing that fair play is not always rewarded, and in the end, feeling when the game is over, for good: this both boxing and life teach. Also faith, however fragile and doubtful, plays a significant role, Frankie goes to mass every day to expiate some guilt of his past life, he needs to believe in something beyond man, although not being fully convinced and although there comes a time in everyone's life when you are alone with your conscience and no one but yourself can make the right decision (the priest, too, knows that religious teachings do not always go hand in hand with the troubles of life).

As the movie approached the end I seemed not to be able to stand the strong emotional engagement, I felt like changing the channel, but I did not, obviously, since it is a movie you have to feel until the utmost. Clint Eastwood is the prototype of true humanity, there are no sufficient words to express his greatness, and his pairing with the always impeccable Morgan Freeman make the story reach the deepest chords of the human soul. Hilary Swank proves to be a talented and courageous actress, in that she let herself be deprived of her natural beauty and femininity to convey the bare truth of life. It is a must see movie, one of those which make you think, cry, feel and cry again in an extreme way, a milestone in the history of cinema.",9
24 September 2007,Good Story; Too Many Caricatures For Me,"I can't say that I've ever been interested in women's boxing (I'm not really a fan of any kind of boxing to be honest) but this story did interest me so I gave it a look see. It's a pretty good, traditional kind of ""underdog goes for it"" story with a solid cast that held my interest, although I can't honestly say that I was ever on the edge of my seat with any of this.

The lead characters are all well played. Hilary Swank surprised me in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, the 31 year old who decides she wants to be a professional boxer to get out of her life as a waitress. She handled the part very well and was pretty believable. Clint Eastwood played her manager, Frankie Dunn. Personally, I thought he was showing his age a bit here but again he was solid in the role of the over-cautious manager, estranged from his daughter and with some definite secrets in his life. Morgan Freeman, as always, pulled off his part as Eddie Du Pris quite well. He also had probably the funniest lines of the movie: first when he was explaining to Frankie why his socks had so many holes, and then after he KO'd the young fighter who hurt his friend - the mentally challenged ""Danger"" (Jay Baruchel) - and said simply ""there's 110"" - a reference to an earlier scene when we learned he had quit boxing after 109 fights.

The primary thing I didn't like about the movie were the over-the-top caricatures. Danger was one example. There was Maggie's stereotypical hillbilly, welfare family. There was the evil champ (the female Clubber Lang, I guess) who would stop at nothing to stop Maggie from getting her title. I didn't think any of those caricatures were really necessary to the plot, and frankly I found those characters irritating. Aside from that, though, I thought this was pretty good stuff.

17 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby: 9/10,"Million Dollar Baby is propaganda by the baby-killing liberals. As is every movie dealing with a controversial issue, especially ones made by those ultra-liberal people at Warner Bros. and that staunch Democrat Clint Eastwood. It seems like the only part of movies people talk about is the ending, even in crappy movies. Supposedly, prints of Hide and Seek were sent out without the final reel, so no one would know the ending until the time came (as if anyone cared). Remember the furor around The Sixth Sense's ending? Everyone knows it now, and if you're not careful, you'll uncover the ending to Million Dollar Baby-a true shocker, if there ever was one. It's unexpected, realistic, and powerful. Try getting that from Hide and Seek.

Hilary Swank (in what is sure to be her second Best Actress Oscar role) is Maggie Fitzgerald, a trailer-park wanna-be boxer who joins up in has-been Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym. Frankie has somewhat of a misogynist attitude, but agrees to train her, anyway. She rises through the circuits of boxing very quickly, and, although reluctantly, Frankie starts to admit that she's a good boxer.

Before I saw Baby, I thought for sure the Academy would finally give the best director award to Martin Scorsese for his mediocre work in The Aviator. But now, I think Eastwood's almost a shoo-in for Best Director. Eastwood frames each shot carefully, and creates the most drama possible from each one. Something that really stood out for me was his use of color. Oftentimes bleak, but always for a purpose, to elict some sort of feeling from the audience. Eastwood uses the minimum of, well, everything possible to make the mood as dreary and unwasteful as possible. And, much like Raging Bull (directed by Eastwood's current rival), the boxing scenes are completely realistic. Except you can tell Eastwood didn't cheat at all (like Scorsese probably did), as this movie is full color, and the boxing scenes build up so much tension it's almost impossible to believe. Million Dollar Baby has both that and the dramatic quality, which ranks it up with the top films of 2004.

The bigger question at hand is this: whodathunk that within five years, a relatively unknown actress will have had two roles of a lifetime and win best actress in five years. Swank was amazing (although not as amazing as Chloe Sevigny, who was robbed) as Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon in Boys Don't Cry, but better here in Million Dollar Baby. Her character is so determined, such a strong spirit basically rising from nothing, and Swank portrays Maggie extremely well. I guess she'll make Annette Bening lose again this year.

Is Million Dollar Baby the best picture of the year? No, mainly because in the last twenty or thirty minutes, it just drags on and on. The message and plot are clear, yet it continues to reiterate it over and over again. We know that the person wants to do something, and another person doesn't want that to happen, but seriously, do we need that extra fifteen minutes of no substance? That's the only complaint I have with this strong, strong movie. What's even better is that it's PG-13, meaning anyone can see it, which they should.

My rating: 9/10 Rated PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images, thematic material and language.",9

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

19 February 2005,Eastwood hits the nail on the head again,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Hard-faced,hard-bitten boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a man battling his own inner-demons and is not at a time in his life where he wants to go against the routine that he has settled into.So when trailer-trash waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wonders into his gym one day,eager to become a female boxer (which Frank has never trained before!) he is understandably disconcerted.However,with some gentle persuasion from his only true friend and former boxing champion Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman) and Maggie's consistent determination,he gradually becomes less stuck-in-his-ways and heralds Maggie to championship level,and to the triumpths and tragedies that follow...

As is noted in the trivia section,this is no less than Clint's 25th film as director,his 57th film as an actor and his 21st film as a producer.There can be no question that this is a man truly deserving of his lifetime achievement award.It is truly remarkable that,even at the age of 74,Clint's name can still garner a cinema release (even a limited one,as in the case of films like Blood Work and True Crime) as opposed to having slipped into a life of DTV mediocrity.Yet it is also his style that keeps his films distinguished and apart from any other films of this day.In other words,you know an Eastwood film when you see one.This,like a fair few of his previous efforts,is a mature,slow,considerate film that the 2-Fast-2-Furious generation are unlikely to have the patience and attention span to sit through.As a previous reviewer noted,Clint refuses to 'dumb-his-films-down' and cut corners in any way...

While you have to admire his longitivity,the fact remains that Eastwood has never been a great emotional actor.There's a scene near the end where he appears to be trying to cry that comes off as terribly unconvincing.Yet he's as great as the grizzled,hard-faced tough guy act as he's ever been,and,even at 74,there were certain scenes where his physical appearance really scared me and made me think I still wouldn't want to mess with him in real life.I suppose the same could be said of his co-star Freeman,but,like Eastwood,he does his thing and provides an engaging narrative voice-over throughout the film.Yet the real star of the show and the deserved Oscar winner is Swank,very good as the feisty,determined,give-it-all-she's-got-girl knowing she can't fail or else succumb to a life of further mediocrity.

What will further distance the film from a large proportion of the modern day audience is it's heavy,hard-hitting (forgive the pun!) scenes.It's got a 12A certificate,yet it's doubtful a lot of people that age will have the maturity,or,ridiculous as it seems,even mental responsibility to handle it.It's a gentle,easy-flowing film that shows Eastwood's maturity as a film-maker and star and,in this day and age,is distinctly,discernably Eastwood.*****",
20 May 2007,Unforgettable,"This is easily one of the most unforgettable, heart-wrenching, bittersweet films I've ever seen. Eastwood not only directs a masterpiece, but directs himself - a feat which I'm told is rather difficult. Morgan Freeman's narration is hauntingly loving, even though the story he has to tell is quite dark, but the darkness is in the reality of the story, and not in the hearts of those involved. There are few obvious effects, car chases, bullets fired, or bodies burned, but this is quite beautiful in its story, grace, and execution.

This is one movie which earned the kudos (and multiple awards) it earned. There are many award-winners which made me stop and say, ""Huh?"" But this is definitely NOT one of them.

Further, this is a movie for everyone. This is not a chick flick, but neither is it a guy flick. Literally all walks can love this work. It is simply amazing, and was a total surprise for this reviewer.

It rates a 9.3/10 from...

the Fiend :.",9
27 March 2009,Great Drama!,"Million Dollar Baby is a great, moving story. This is a movie that sort of deserved the Best Picture award. Nearly all the actors did a fantastic job especially Clint Eastwood.

Clint Eastwood stars as a grumpy boxing trainer. He trained some of the best over his long career. Then he meets a poor girl with ambition of winning boxing fights. But, Frankie is reluctant to train the girl, Maggie. He eventually gives in and things happen that are destined to change lives.

As I said before, the acting is superb. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank all gave great performances.

The story is a moving one. You do not have to be into sports to see and understand the intense drama. You should expect to have a few tears during this film.

Overall, Clint Eastwood did a great job. He had a wonderful career acting and directing films. I rate this film 9/10.",9
1 February 2005,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is A Compelling Daram","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a very compelling drama. Clint Eastwood has directed a very controversial masterpiece. He portrays the retired boxer and now trainer, Frankie Dunn. He has not seen his estranged daughter, Katie, in years. He persists in writing to her weekly, but he never receives a response. He is associated with Morgan Freeman's character, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, also retired and suffering from the loss of his right eye from an earlier fight. The real star of this picture is Hilary Swank who gives a very believable performance of a moderately young female boxer to be. She aches to be trained by Eastwood's character, and finally earns the right to do so. The emotional and complex ending is too overwhelming to describe in this brief epistle, and one should not spoil it for the viewing public. Suffice it to say that you should bring your box of tissue, and chew on the meat of this drama for a long time after it is ended on the screen. It deserves as many thumbs up as it can get.

29 January 2005,Don't Get Boxed In! Check This Baby Out!,"Millions of critics have been enraptured by the sheer emotional impact of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". With ""Mystic River"" and now ""Baby"", critics that were once ""unforgiven"" to Clint because of such clunkers as ""Blood Work"" & ""Bronco Billy"" are now in awe to the Clintster. Not that Clint cares about that sort of thing so much because in his eyes those pundits should really be called ""The Witches of Eastwood"". ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, an impecunious waitress who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. Maggie is on a relentless pursuit to have a surly old trainer named Frankie train her. Maggie works out in Frankie's boxing gym everyday in hoping to persuade Frankie to be her hit-man. Frankie is played by none other than Eastwood himself. To be ""frank"" with you, I admired Eastwood's straightforward acting work here, but do not think it deserved a Best Actor Oscar nomination. However, his direction of ""Million Dollar Baby"" was worth its price. His attention to detail and framework was of the technical knockout variety. Moreover, the movie's startling emotional turn midway in the narrative is one of the most profound plot-twisters that I have seen in film in a very long time. Morgan Freeman plays the assistant gym sidekick to Frankie who he himself plays an imperative role as the overseer & narrator of the story's dramatic chops. Freeman is an acting legendary God in the business; he did play ""God"" in ""Bruce Almighty"". However, his work here was poignant but not of the Best Supporting Actor nomination weight-class. The heavyweight of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is Hilary Swank. She delivers passionately blow-by-blow. Her lauded performance has been recognized by numerous critics and my scorecard also shares that exact sentiment. She is the frontrunner for the Best Actress Academy Award. If Swank wins her second golden boy, Hilary will be living large in the ""Hollywood Hills"". Paul Haggis' screenplay does possess a heartfelt punch to it, but it felt lightweight at times in the church scenes. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is somber and it's unlike your typical boxing movie, but those are no reasons why you should throw in the towel for ""Million Dollar Baby"". Spend a few dollars and check out the ""Million Dollar Baby""! **** Good",8
16 January 2005,Good acting but generally overrated,"I wanted to like this movie, especially since I am a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director and Hilary Swank as an actress. The previews didn't interest me at all - but the almost universal praise heaped on this film did make me want to see it.

I agree with the reviewer who said the film felt ""scripted"" - not only that, but watching scenes (near the beginning) with Clint and Morgan were like watching people ""act"" and ""play the scene"". Hilary Swank saves the day with her performance, believable and truthful. Clint's work later in the film is exemplary. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and here he plays simply a variation on his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" character, mumbling through some scenes making his words incomprehensible.

I didn't feel an emotional connection to this film at all - I don't see it as ""Clint's masterpiece"" at all - ""Mystic River"" is a far superior film, which had me extremely emotionally involved. The Morgan Freeman voice-over really got on my nerves very early on. I am not a fan of voice-over - I believe it's an easy way out of explaining things rather than SHOWING them.

I can't understand all the hype about MDB - I really can't. I give it (a very generous) 7 out of 10.",7
31 January 2005,Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004,"I don't understand all the praise. Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but it's flat, obvious, and not at all memorable. Eastwood's last film, Mystic River, was ten times better. Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student. He finally does accept her, especially after his friend, Morgan Freeman, who works as a janitor in his gym, convinces him of her talent. Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama. Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter, both making up for lost loved ones (Swank's father is dead, and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him). The final act adds a tearjerker. There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym. It's slow, but mostly entertaining. Swank is good, but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry. It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated, especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways. His direction is fine, but he can barely speak. Plus, he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body. Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role. He can't speak clearly, either. He narrates the film, and it can often be very hard to understand him. Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing, but it certainly isn't award-worthy. 7/10.",7
27 February 2005,"touching, great and deserving any kind of prize! A masterpiece!","It's really difficult to find any kind of words to describe this film greatness. What first seems to be a conventional boxing plot turns into an incredible, brilliant and devastating movie. Devastating is perhaps the right adjective to tell about the life experiences here handled. It also shows fight sequences but it's not about boxing at all, it's about second chances and love and also meditates on death, friendship and life failures. It's impossible not to be impressed with the grandness of the lead's performances and in particular with the level of perfection achieved by Clint Eastwood. The moving and emotional finale makes the audience wordless and breathless. Don't you dare miss this masterpiece!

I've seen all the movies he's starred in and directed. And I've seen his skills as a storyteller develop, mature and grow. Throughout this period the infatuation remained constant and re-assuring. But today, after viewing 'Million Dollar Baby', I'm totally and completely in love with this man. Clint, his movie, Freeman and Swank deserve to win Oscars in every category for this film. He is a Master of his craft. I want him stick around and do it again and again!.

And I'm in love Hilary too!. She does not act - she becomes!.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

27 February 2005,Clint will never let us down!,"There's something that characterizes Clint Eastwood's films: he usually makes a nice movie out of a simple story. Anyone else would have converted Million Dollar Baby into such a TV Movie or something, kind of a ""Karate Kid"" mixed up with a moral conflict. Nevertheless Eastwood has a steady hand, he's tough when he thinks he has to, and he's spectacular when he thinks the story can afford it. Once again he plays the lead role: the cynical-skeptical-heartless old man unable to feel anything for anyone  till he finally does. Someone will say Clint Eastwood can only play one character; OK, maybe that's true: but he is the best playing it. Hillary Swank makes a great job, bringing to life that white-trash-boxer-aspiring (the first time she participates in such a nice project since ""Boys Don't Cry"").

A good movie as was to be expected if Clint Eastwood is behind and in front of the camera. And, why not, he resolves it courageously (there are some subjects that they don't want to talk about there in the United And Puritan States Of North America).

My rate: 7.5/10",8
9 January 2005,One of the year's best,"Clint Eastwood just won't give up. Like good wine, the older - the better, Clint just keeps delivering unforgettable moments to movie lovers willing to grasp his world of human heart. ""Million dollar baby"" is not a movie for everyone. Many people will see it just because the trailer looks like one of the sequels in ""Rocky"" franchise, the only difference for boxer being a girl. How wrong. The first half of this masterpiece gives us a graceful insight into the lives of our heroes, all carrying some sort of emotional/physical wounds. Just when you think the movie is slipping into cliché' territory of Mr. Eastwood makes a U-Turn and the next moment you're embarrassed for even coming up with the thought. Pure and simple this is a film about friendship, redemption, value of life, perseverance and above all love. Love in this film is stronger than religion, stronger than life itself, stronger than all the secular things. Eastwood shows us that love is God, however cruel his works may seem. Performances are pure brilliance : Hilary Swank shows once more that she is probably the greatest actress of younger generation. If there is justice, she will bag another Oscar. Eastwood adds such a depth to the thick-skinned but fragile Frankie Dunn that I cant't see anyone else doing it better. Morgan Freeman is exquisite as well. His soothing voice as a narrator and a mere glance at his face blows you away. For anyone who's looking for moving emotion in a movie and not just 2 hours of popcorn fun, this is a gem not to be missed. Back to back with ""Mar adentro"", ""Million dollar baby"" is the best movie of 2004!!!",9

11 March 2008,Great,"Million Dollar Baby (2004)

**** (out of 4)

It's rather amazing to see how much great work Clint Eastwood has done over the past fifteen years. It's so great in fact that I think you really need to take a closer look at him as being one of the greatest filmmakers of recent decades. I certainly don't think this is one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly a revalation in today's terms since Eastwood has the balls to do something the audience doesn't expect. I knew something happened at the end but I was able to not have it spoiled by reading nothing about the film. I went back and read some of the controversy that came up and found it all quite silly. I guess when people have nothing better to do they start stuff up. In the discussion thread here I saw a lot of people bashing the white trash family in the film and I found it rather funny that their locations had them in states not really known for ""white trash"". Being from KY and having to hear these jokes, I must say this is one of the most realistic examples of this type of family. In fact, I'd say it was the most realistic and there certainly wasn't any cartoonish moments or over the top moments. The performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are right on the mark. As with Mystic River, it's good to throw the CGI in the toilet and see a movie being carried by great acting.

As for the ending, again bless Eastwood.",
5 February 2005,Outstanding!,"For whatever reason, I did had reservations about going to see Million Dollar Baby. I am extremely happy that I decided to go because this movie was totally entertaining from start to finish. It simply grabs you and does not let up. Million Dollar Baby will be a keeper for my video collection! Eastwood, Freeman, and Swank all give superb performances and I sincerely hope they are given their due at the Oscars in March. The character's developed throughout the film and the actor's portrayal of them made the characters believable. Granted a few of the fight scene's were a bit over the top but then it is still Hollywood. What I like the most is the lack of special effects and the total concentration on the development of the story. Borrowing from Roger Ebert: Thumbs Way UP!

19 March 2005,Good Old Fashion Storytelling,"The funny thing is that a few months before this film came out, I was extremely disappointed with cinema in general and asked, ""Why can't anyone just make a simple story and tell it?"" Sure, there's a handful of films out there like that, but why are they so few and far between? Why must there be gimmicks? Why so many distractions (that don't distract) for the audience? And along comes Clint Eastwood . . . thank you, Mr. Eastwood for having integrity and making the movies you want to make.

I love this movie. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best films I've seen in the past ten years. What is Million Dollar Baby? Just a good old fashion movie, shot in a solid old fashion style, whose focus is squarely placed on its characters where it belongs. That's it ladies and gentlemen. This is story telling at its best.

And honestly, the story really isn't even remotely unique  a character has a dream and shoots for it despite the opposition. This same story has been told thousands of times under thousands of titles and thousands of variations on the circumstance--in one movie it happens to be a warrior fighting for a cause, in another movie it's about an Olympic team, here it's simply about a woman who wants to take up boxing. But you know what? If it's done well, it doesn't matter how many times we've heard variations on the tale.

Million Dollar Baby is done well.

I could go through and talk about the characters, the wonderfully realistic, sincere, and heartfelt performances from Eastwood, the ever-awesome Morgan Freeman, and Swank, but this film's strength lay in ""how"" and not ""what."" As stated earlier, it's a simple story that's been told numerous time--person has a dream and chases it--what separates Million Dollar Baby from the rest of the pack is how the story/characters are presented, and that needs to be experienced first hand.

Even if people are usually turned off by ""sports"" films (believe me, I'm one of them), I still highly recommend Million Dollar Baby because, quite frankly, this is not a sports movie. In Million Dollar Baby you meet Eddie, Franky, and Maggie, you spend time with these three, learn about them, and they become real so you no longer watch their lives, you experience it too.

It's somewhat strange that the best films I've seen I have so little to really say about them. The greatest compliment I can give to any film is simply stating that an accurate description is beyond words. It has to be seen, heard, and felt. The film has to be experienced.

Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies.",

21 December 2004,Outstanding,"Saw this last night in LA without much knowing what to expect. Hadn't read many reviews...only knew I liked the work of the three main stars. Swank carries the film and is at her absolute best. The last 45 minutes are some of the most powerful film-making I can remember. Eastwood is also in top form but allows Swank's performance to trump his own. Freeman is outstanding and might have done enough to earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is so much more than a boxing movie, but it's right there with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". I saw ""The Aviator"" two days ago and enjoyed ""MDB"" more.

However, the film is not without fault...Eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air. The dialogue at times appears a little too ad-libbed. There are some minor logical inconsistencies. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.

11 December 2009,The Million Dollar Baby....,"I have seen this movie about 5-6 times. And I am sure i can watch it as much as i can.. because it interesting well told....

The best thing of the movie is THE STORY and DIRECTION....screenplay is fine and performances are very good.But the movie is sad i had tears in my eyes in the last 15-20 minutes.... and the direction is sensitive..

Anyways the movie is Excellent and a must see.And its the only movie of the decade won Best Picture Oscar that was my choice as well.

Original score was good Clint Eastwood is really impressive.... but direction had some flaws but i think million dollar baby is his best movie.

So what do you guys think Agree / Disagree.... do vote for the review.",9
28 February 2005,Excellent film from a true Renaissance man,"Congrats to all responsible for the film. I'm writing this a couple hours after Oscars finished- yup, that's right, it's now 2008. Nah seriously, this is an excellent film. One wouldn't know what the film was about from the previews. Not that one should. Nevertheless, typically accomplished work from Clint. And this time, he wrote the music too. If he could film the movie and be in it at the same time, he could cut down on salaries to people by minimizing the number of people in the production. All that said, Morgan Freeman is excellent, though really the Oscar is a bit of a typically Hollywood, guilt-ridden, let's-right-wrongs Oscar. That being said, he's one of the best, and he's as good as ever. One's tempted to take him for granted, he's that good. I think I'm going to have to go back and see ""Unforgiven"" again to see him collaborating with Clint again. Hilary Swank is excellent. She didn't deserve the Oscar, I'm sorry. Obviously, much of the Academy hadn't seen ""Vera Drake"" or she wouldn't have gotten it. I haven't seen ""Maria Full of Grace"" so don't know how that lady's performance measured up. All that being said, Swank really is a very talented actress. The film itself, well, some nice elements to it. Swank conveys winsomeness and determination as well as any actress this side of Jodie Foster. The characters tend toward stock, but really, they are nicely colored to the point that the story is not disabled by their blandness. Clint takes what might be a straight-forward sports biopic and makes it something so much more. This is a very enjoyable movie.",9
29 January 2005,Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't,"The above maxim is from a poster in the film's boxing gym, and its presence very cleverly and subtly pertains deeply to what transpires in this movie.

Eastwood gets everything right in this one, beginning with Morgan Freeman's eloquent (but yet never overwrought) voice being utilized as the narrative - this in itself is transcendent, immediately elevating the film to mythic heights. And Hilary Swank's Maggie - there are no words to describe what she manages to achieve in this performance, no words could ever begin to do justice to the depths of what she makes us feel. And Eastwood's turn as Frankie is equally brilliant, coming from a place of true, pure and deep understanding of the human condition and all the dark ramifications that implies.

The best thing about the film - and another one of the things that elevates it to mythic status - is how there is not one minute detail that doesn't belong; there is nothing on screen that doesn't contribute completely and utterly to the film's power - the amusing banter, for example, is not there to simply kill time or to create comic relief but rather it is intrinsic to the characters, to show their almost-unrelenting heart in the face of monumental adversity. Eastwood has matured magnificently as a director, he has made me a believer after all these years; I could not get home faster to get to IMDb and give this staggeringly heartfelt masterpiece a TEN.",10
27 February 2005,"A Dream,a Team and a WINNER..................","This is a movie which is up there with almost all of Clint's movies,And more so cause he directed this one.Don't know how he manages to get the story, actors and performance from the crew, so brilliantly synchronized time and again to get the Oscar nominations.The bonding between the characters has been portrayed very beautifully in this movie. Once I saw it, I was sure its gonna get a few Oscars among the categories it gets nominated for, and guess what it got the grandest of them all ""THE BEST PICTURE"" and of course ""THE BEST DIRECTOR"".I thought last year he was robbed out of it so probably made up for it this year.Just go and enjoy a real good movie.Better seen than being written I guess....... a real 10/10

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

19 January 2009,"Clint Eastwood as ""Frankie"" Goes to Hollywood with Swank and Rope Burns","""'I don't train girls,' trainer Frankie Dunn growls. But something's different about the spirited boxing hopeful who shows up daily at Dunn's gym. All she wants is a fighting chance. Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multi-award-winning tale of heart, hope and family. Hilary Swank plays resilient Maggie, determined not to abandon her one dream. And Morgan Freeman is Scrap, gym caretaker and counterpoint to Dunn's crustiness. Grab your dreams and come out swinging. 'Million Dollar Baby' is an absolute knockout.""

Clint Eastwood Hits the Nail on the Head.

I expected this film to be a ""feminist"" version of the traditional male-dominated ""boxing movie"". It opens with a realistic depiction of the kind of physical damage boxing causes - so, I thought, are they going to show Q-Tips being shoved into the bloody, slit open face of movie star Hillary Swank? I thought not Although Ms. Swank does not suffer a wound like the one in the introduction, ""Million Dollar Baby"" does not skirt this issue. The film is as realistic as they come. Swank is amazing, absolutely earning her many ""Best Actress"" honors.

""She grew up knowing one thing, she was trash.""

Auteur Eastwood is even more incredible - as producer, director, star, and composer. He uses his years of film-making experience wisely, and does not let one role interfere with another. The goal of a superior film is achieved, with generosity rather than egotism in evidence. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, also, the crowning achievement of the ""Eastwood style"". The lighting is exquisite. The film is quiet when it should be quiet, and noisy when it should be NOISY. The harder-to-manage ""quietness"" is expertly handled. The film is beautiful without being loud - it's starkly beautiful.

Eastwood allows his audience to become a part of this movie.

Morgan Freeman gives one of filmdom's all-time ""Best Supporting Actor"" performances. His character's narration gives the film poetry. Narration is one of the easiest techniques to administer, but one of the hardest to muster convincingly; Mr. Freeman's is most convincing. And, Freeman's more subtle counterpoint story - his relationship with slow-witted Jay Baruchel (as Danger ""Flip"" Barch) - gives the film hope. Mr. Baruchel might have won a ""Best Supporting the Best Supporting Actor"" award (as of this writing, not introduced).

""Boxing is about respect - getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy.""

""Million Dollar Baby"" is about loving, non-sexual and non-familial relationships (count the number of sexually involved ""couples"" in this film), and how very important these relationships are to our lives, and dreams. ""Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye,"" Eastwood echoes Lloyd Price, ""Just because you left and said goodbye, do you think that I will sit and cry? Even if my heart should tell me so, darling I would rather let you go...""

21 May 2007,Morgan Freeman was Outstanding,"If Morgan Freeman, ( Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) did not appear in this film it would have failed on its face, because he gave the best supporting performance I have ever seen him create. Hilary Swank, (Maggie Fitgerald) put her heart and soul into this role as a prize fighter who climbs to unbelievable heights in the world of women boxing with the great help of both Eddie Dupris and Clint Eastwood,(Frankie Dunn). Frankie Dunn constantly has gone to his church and asked the priest many questions concerning the Catholic Faith and even runs into trouble with the Priest trying to understand his frame of thinking. Frnkie Dunn asks the priest a question that will change the entire mood of the film and put it into a very controversial film concerning Life or Death. Nice film.

24 January 2006,"Well-Crafted But Ludicrous, Insulting Story","GOOD NEWS - Interesting, right from the start....nicely filmed......an involving story with a female lead character you really care about with a fine performance by Hilary Swank, and the always-entertaining Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman as the male leads. The story, whatever one's view of the topic here, is well-crafted and certainly one you remember.

BAD NEWS - Talk about an agenda! Who produced this film? Dr. Kevorkian? Hollywood's Liberal agenda for this year must have been euthanasia because this picture, as good as it is, is not Acadamy Award Best Picture material. The championship fight scene, too, is ludicrous, in that the ""bad girl,"" if this was real life, would have been disqualified - period: no if, ands or buts. And - having a priest say the ""f-word?"" Give me a break! There's an example of yet another liberal ""agenda."" - make a cleric look bad whenever possible.

OVERALL - A severely flawed film but definitely interesting and worth seeing if for nothing else than provoking a good discussion on and pros-and-cons of the main subject matter (which ain't boxing, folks).",6
3 July 2007,"A film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead","Unfortunately, it seems as if two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank is one of the least famous actresses who managed to win the prestigious Oscar trophy twice during the course of the years. I say so in great sorrow, as I believe Swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting. And boy can she act! Swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she's playing. If she's the androgynous victim in Boys Don't Cry, the nerdy cashier in the overlooked 11:14 or the powerful underdog boxer in this case  she'll always become the character and deliver a powerhouse, emotional draining, performance.

Anyway Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's little boxer film that could, became a surprise Academy Award best picture winner back in 2005, beating Scorsese's wonderful The Aviator. The plot itself, much like the film and its lead actress, tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, a female boxer (Swank) who rises from her trailer-park life and become a professional fighter against the odds, with the help of her devoted manager, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) a washed-up trainer who has seen much better days. However, this isn't your average boxing film. Unlike Rocky, Cinderella Man and others of the genre, its final twist is truly unpredictable, and will most likely leave you pondering for days after watching the film. Either way, I found it different in the right kind of fashion. It's a film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead. Since it did that and still managed to gross over 100 million dollars in the North American box office alone, I would call it a remarkable achievement for the human spirit.",9
22 August 2005,Reminds us of what is missing in films today!,"One of the reasons that I don't like going to the movies now is the violence and profanity that fills films rather than great meaningful dialogue. I knew the ending which is why I didn't want to see it. I didn't agree with it which is the only reason that I am giving it a 9. I found the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank to be both beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly platonic which is rare in movies today. There is too much focus on sexuality and this film lacks it completely. The relationship is more father and daughter than anything else. Clint's character Frankie Dunn finds a willing substitute in Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character recalls her father fondly in spoken memories only. She does not share the same fondness for her mother and other living relatives. Maggie follows her dream to box professionally which her mother disapproves. Maggie works hard, long hours of waitressing. She saves her pennies and even brings home scraps of leftover food. Hunger and poverty is never really talked about in films anyway. Maggie is a strong character who never gives up her dreams and she is loyal to her trainer, Frankie Dunn who learns to train her. The film's ending still leaves me asking more questions. I am not a person who cries easily and I had tears in my eyes. Morgan Freeman is also wonderful and deserved his Academy Award. In any other year, Clint would have won for Best Actor too and Hilary's performance is both heartbreaking and Oscar winning. She is the best actress of her generation with her own heartbreaking story. She always gives it her all in film and this is no exception.",9
31 January 2005,Eastwood triumphs yet again,"Usually when the latest 'big thing' gets released, I go to cinema and end up disappointed. With Million Dollar Baby, however; that was not the case. Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw, gritty realism. The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured, no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge, and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline. Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene, which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score, before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions. This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it.

Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with. In movies like Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' trilogy, down to his own films, such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven; we are with Clint every step of the way, no matter what evil deeds he's doing. He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character. For this movie, Clint has given himself a support role, and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank. Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie, and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken. She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen, and delivers a fine performance with it. Emotionally as well as physically, Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald; the character she plays on screen. If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004, there is something seriously wrong. Despite taking a back step, Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with. Once again, Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing; the catalyst of the story. This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies, and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor.

The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking. During the boxing scenes especially, Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured. The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency, as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way. When she takes a punch, we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping, the same as the character does on screen. It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character, but Million Dollar Baby, not satisfied with just making us feel  allows us to become one with the emotions on screen. However, all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created. Basically, it's the musical score. Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film, and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason, many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all. Music almost always adds to the images on screen, but sometimes no music is better. I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection, but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me.

Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape. However, it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting, great direction and a brilliant storyline. I'm not a boxing fan, but when it comes to films like this; it doesn't matter what you like. Usually when I go to the cinema, there's a mad rush to the doors at the end  no matter what the film  but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby. Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled, and although I cant speak for everyone; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath. I don't need to say this but I will: see this movie.",8
15 October 2009,Here Here Clint Eastwood,"It just doesn't seem possible that Clint Eastwood of Sergio Leon who acted in Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly can direct such a different kind of movies which I like as well such as Bridges of Madison County, Mystic River, Changeling and Millioin Dollar Baby.

The movie is just awesome! A good story with a wonderful actor Hillary Swank. She is playing a challenging role because such roles are usually prepared for men but Hillary is so good that even men admired her in this role. What can you say more when you have an amazing presence of two great actors like Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman.

It's a movie that you definitely need to watch and believe me you don't want to miss such a work.

2 February 2005,Oh Baby what a film!,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film about fighting, both physical and otherwise, that traces the story of three diverse yet connected characters. Eastwood, who also directs, stars as Frankie, an aged boxing trainer and gym owner. Morgan Freeman, who narrates the film, plays his right hand man and friend, Scrap. And Hilary Swank joins in as Maggie, a young lady eager to learn the sport. Expectedly the story follows Maggie's boxing journey, and perhaps more importantly, Frankie's relationships with Scrap, Maggie, and an unseen daughter, as they each deal with the powerful themes of loyalty, forgiveness, and love.

Watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ridiculously enjoyable for a drama, the cinematic equivalent of cruising the spectacular Pacific Coast Highway with the wind whipping through your hair. The pace is steady and deliberate, like much of Eastwood's directorial work, but far from slow. And the scenery...oh, the scenery. Eastwood and Freeman, in roles similar to the screen image that each has cultivated over the years, are simply magnificent. How many actors can enrapture an audience with a discussion of socks? Or bleach? With their commanding presences, easy dialogue, and evident listening capacities, the pair presents a clinic in portraying old friends. Impressively, Swank fits right in with the two veterans. Sporting an impish smile and dogged determination, she expresses a proud humility that remains strong while reflecting her character's rough background. The ability to see great actors working brilliantly with great material is why many people go to the movies, and all three stars are worth the price of admission to observe, fully worthy of their Oscar nominations, as their interactions result in a picture that remains fully engaging without zooming from scene to scene.

The beautiful simplicity of everything is captivating as well. Much like last year's ""Mystic River"", Eastwood's ever steady hand guides the entire picture. The cinematography of Tom Stern (""River"") is striking but not overwhelming, framing images perfectly and using slow movements to enhance the drama. His muted color scheme of blues, grays, and greens creates and matches the mood, and makes the occasional flashes of color all the more vibrant.

Also like ""River"", ""Baby"" is accompanied by Eastwood's own simple yet elegant theme, on both classical guitar and piano, which accentuates the powerful emotion of the film. Baby lacks the palpable emotion of River, replacing it instead with drama that bubbles beneath the veneer of the boxing theme, and springs to life during the quiet in-between scenes that make the film great. On the sports movie spectrum, ""Baby"" sits somewhere between the pure sporting nature of ""Rocky"" and the sports-tinged drama of ""Raging Bull"". The boxing storyline is not unfamiliar, but the high technical value makes it seem fresh and original.

Just when the course of the story seems apparent, in the final half hour the road of ""Baby"" takes a dramatic hairpin turn, as the tone is drastically altered, nearly sending the audience into the ditch. The change throws the car out of alignment and disrupts the ride, but once things settle down, one can look back and see how brave a cinematic decision was made in choosing such a path. The end result is a a different course that culminates in a major moral dilemma, one that the film answers without preaching or diving into the issues of such a decision. In fact, ""Baby"" doesn't even pretend to solve the problem, merely presenting the chosen option. Aside from that potential moral controversy, the only problem with the film is the precarious portrayal of the church, which is questionable at best and sacrilegious at worst, although the referenced flaws certainly do exist in the real world.

Freeman's narration alone merits a recommendation for ""Million Dollar Baby"". But add the astonishing performances both in front of and behind the camera, and the aggregate is one of the best dramas in recent years, strong enough to present an extraneous story arc as touching instead of superfluous.

Bottom Line: This is quite possibly the best film of 2004. 9 of 10.",9
31 January 2005,IMDb'ers Restoreth My Soul!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

20 March 2007,Tough Ain't Enough,"Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor thirty-one year old waitress from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family, decides to make a difference through boxing. She convinces the experienced hardened boxing trainer Frankie Dunn to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, who sees her potential as a boxer. Frankie has a problematical relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career.

Overall, this is one of the best films ever. This was the best film of 2004, which won it an Oscar for Best Picture, of course. This film is strong, powerful, dramatic, and is a total knockout! The acting by the leading trio (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) are all fantastic! There are some scenes that makes your stomachs turn and some scenes that make you laugh.

This is a terrific film with everything you want in a good film. It has some dark and sad moments and light and comedic moments. You'll love this film if you actually want to see a good one.",9
3 June 2005,Eastwood and Haggis make a good team.,"Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, Jay Baruchel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker. Written by Paul Haggis. Directed by Clint Eastwood.

Eastwood and Haggis make a good team.

Normally I don't care for Boxing movies like Rocky's 1-5 but I made and exception for Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and later on Cinderella Man. The story is two men that own a gym when a troubled waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank, a surprising bolster in the actress category) waltzes in their gym and wants to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Eastwood; also the director). After her plea for his help he gives in along with the co-owner Morgan Freeman. Who makes a good sidekick and helps make the movie more enjoyable. Even though the screenplay written by Paul Haggis (who will later go on to make Crash) was fantastic and one of the best boxing screenplays since Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin did Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull screenplay. Overall the movie had a great script with capricious dialogue along with just plain good acting on Eastwood, Freeman, and Swank's part. My final rating 10/10.",10

23 July 2009,Veterans bring seasoned fists but fresh perspective to boxing drama,"Boxing, despite the sport's decline in popularity since the '80s, has managed to make for some of the best films. Starting with ""Rocky"" and then films such as ""Raging Bull,"" boxing has is one of those things that seems to best represent life's journey and its struggles. There might not be a stronger visual metaphor than the glory and physical danger of someone with a goal laying it all on the line in the ring. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is the latest film to exploit this genre, and armed with great talents it manages to do so with a fresh point of view.

Talent number one is Morgan Freeman. He could narrate what I did yesterday and it would be considered Oscar-worthy. There is no one better to impart wisdom to an audience and half of why ""Million Dollar Baby"" communicates its ideas and themes so clearly is because of him.

Talent number two is Paul Haggis, producer and screenwriter. Haggis takes stories by F.X Toole and crafts something that boxing-movie lovers haven't seen before. It doesn't lean entirely on the exhausted underdog cliché (""Rocky"") or the 'rise and fall of a star' one either (""Raging Bull"").

This underdog, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is more complex and more troubled. Knowing full well she's Southern white trash, she still spends whatever money she has to join the club owned by old-time boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood, who also directs) and tells the stubborn old grouch that she won't leave until he trains her. After taking a few tips from the club's assistant manager, a retired and half-blind former boxer named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), she captures his attention and he agrees to help her toward her dream of being a boxer.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is about ambition, about establishing yourself as something and achieving in even the smallest way. Of all the boxing movies, its themes are the most universal. We all want to leave this life knowing we didn't waste it and ""Million Dollar Baby"" wrestles with this on levels both obvious and subtle through its central characters.

The final talent is Mr. Oscar -- Eastwood. His film is very quiet, shadow-enveloped and contemplative. He lets the characters tell this story and our interest in them keeps our attention. The actors also fit their roles perfectly. Swank has proved she can do Southern American gender ambiguous in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" Freeman has shown wise supporting role prowess in ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and Clint Eastwood redefined tough for the silver screen in his career, making him perfect for the troubled role of Frankie.

Everything comes together in this film effortlessly. That's what veteran filmmakers do. Though Haggis at this point was relatively unestablished, his storytelling is elegant and the veterans behind him make the script succeed in its every purpose. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sports drama, but not like you might think. Boxing is the vehicle for delivering a knock out punch of a greater sort, one that brings us unique characters and a terrific story.

11 January 2006,One of the Great Love Stories Trapped Within a Flawed Film,"There is both much to admire, and to despise, within this film. I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, yet the negatives are so odious, so blatant, that they amount to a major defacement--all the more so because they could have so easily been corrected--marring what otherwise might have been a masterpiece of film making. As a drama about two lonely people who find each other and fall in love (though not in a romantic sense), this film is in a class few others share. As a drama about the sport of boxing, it veers wildly between insightful and ridiculous, and the film as a whole too often embraces caricature and melodrama, crippling our suspension of disbelief and leaving it floundering.

The film revolves about Maggie Fitzgerald--a 30 year old woman who attempts to escape a difficult upbringing in a single-minded pursuit of a boxing career--and Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck manager/trainer and owner of a rundown boxing gym. She basically takes up residence in his gym, working out and trying to persuade him to take her under his wing. He wants no part of managing a ""girl""--especially one virtually over the hill--and puts her off with one caustic rebuff after another. She persists, and over time, stubbornly refusing to take no for an answer, finally persuades him to train her. Before long, reluctantly, a bond begins to grow between the crusty old trainer, permanently estranged from his only daughter, and this fiercely determined woman whose father, the only person who ever loved her, died long ago. It is this growing relationship that is the heart of the film, and it is magnificently played out between these fine actors. Hilary Swank is mesmerizing, every gesture, every expression is convincing. The fact that her character is so sweet-natured, so adorable (in an early fight, she shrugs her shoulders to Frankie's mock disgust in such a way that it had to have melted the hearts of anyone with a heart) that it might give us pause later after the lights go on when we might ask, ""How could this immensely genial character have been so alone?"" but Swank is so compelling that as we watch her, we never doubt her or her situation for a moment. Clint Eastwood is almost as good, and his brusque, brooding, deeply wounded old gym-rat provides an excellent foil to Swank's more hopeful character. We become ensnared in their emotional dynamics, much more than their pursuit of a boxing title. As we watch their love for each other grow (the love between surrogate father and daughter), our love for each of their characters grows as well, so that the ultimate tragedy that befalls them is almost unbearable to watch.

Or at least, it would be if you can ignore the intruding absurdities. First among them are some of the fight sequences. Most of these play well, though there are occasional moments when a punch clearly lands upon air, half a meter from the opponent's face, and yet we hear an accompanying sound effect as if there had been a solidly landed blow. But the principle problem concerns the fights involving a character called ""The Blue Bear""--a figure so ludicrous her appearance in a comic book would be jarringly idiotic. We see her perform acts of deranged mayhem in the ring that make the biting off of an ear seem pacifist. A Nazi Storm Trooper would find her embarrassing. Anyone displaying these traits in real life would be barred from prize-fighting years before reaching a title fight. To suggest that such a one could become champion is light years beyond far-fetched. Apparently, every one of her referees, and the two judges at court-side, are carefully selected for their inability to open their eyes. {Brief Spoilers Ahead} In the climatic showdown, we are told the ""Bear"" wins in spite of egregious violations, including the knock-out punch which occurs 10 seconds after the bell has sounded. {Spoilers End} I thought ""Cinderella Man's"" depiction of the fighter Max Baer was a bit over the top--but not compared to this. In a hundred other boxing films I have seen nothing to approach the outlandishness of this depiction.

There were other problems. Maggie's surviving family were overwrought, cardboard caricatures. Morgan Freeman, who plays Frankie's closest friend, provides the film's narration, and though he does his usual excellent job, his comments weren't as finely written (or were perhaps over written) as those he voiced in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Two or three times we hear him talk about being ""somewhere between nowhere and good-bye,"" which was two or three times too many.

In spite of the drawbacks, which are far from incidental, I found myself spellbound by Maggie and Frankie's relationship. There are other nice things about the film, not least of which is a crowd-pleasing ""interchange"" between Freeman and a bully/would-be fighter, and Eastwood's direction which, in spite of contributing to the lapses noted above, does a fabulous job of getting the most from his cast and providing a wonderfully paced movie--but it is the strength of the central relationship which buoys the film, keeping it afloat in the midst of its sea of weakness. I cannot help but mourn the loss of what could have been. A more realistic villain, a fine-tuning of the script, and this might have been both the greatest boxing movie of all time, and one of the great love stories. I'd like to shake Haggis (the writer) and Eastwood for failing to fully capitalize on their opportunity.",8
31 March 2022,"A beautiful, poetic modern masterpiece.","I've seen this 4 or 5 times now since its' release. There are a few films that I hold most dear, that I can relate to on a profound level. This is one of them. I defy anyone not to get something out of this movie.

It's truly powerful, poignant and elegantly performed by a wonderful cast. It touches my soul so deeply it's quite difficult to express. Even on the 4th or 5th viewing, the screenplay reaches deep into your chest, yanks out your heart, slams it on the ground and stamps on it over and over 'til it is pulverised. But it achieves this heartbreak so organically and genuinely, without being contrived or manipulative. Just like life itself.

It's simply a great story, brought to life by one of the great directors of our time. A masterfully assembled work of art that I love, nearly as much as Frankie adores his ""Cuishle"".

26 March 2005,Great Movie,"I could write a review of this movie and point to all the reason why I liked it... but I would rather talk about something else. We all have different views on things. Film is art and art is subjective. I find more and more on the IMDb people make their posts as if their view the absolute truth. many arm chair film critics and wannabe film bluffs add their two cents with righteousness than is offensive. Reading the various posts about this movie only makes my point. One person ""FreddyShoop"" says, ""It is not the best film of the year, but probably in the top ten."" He then proceeds to vote it as a one. Now he is certainly entitled to his opinion, but their are so many contradictions in the voting that I no longer have any faith in the voting totals. Personally I cannot see how anyone could vote this movie a one. The acting is good. The look of the film in brilliant. Not your cup of tea? Okay... but a one. No better than Police Academy 5 or Battlefield Earth? I'm not talking total votes... I'm just pointing out that people gave those films a one... In fact if you go to the highest rated film on the entire IMDb, ""The Godafather"" you will see that 119,493 people voted for it (as of this writing) and that out of those 7,229 people gave it a one! Incredible! Now I am not saying the people who gave it a one are not entitled to their opinion (even though I cannot understand how anyone could ever reach that conclusion) what I am saying is that I find the voting system to be misused. People seem to either vote in 10's and 1's. More thought should be given to make the votes more reliable.",
6 January 2005,"Spoilers! Fun at times, suffers from clichés and maudlin ending","SPOILER ALERT! I enjoyed the cinematography. The gym looked great. Hilary Swank was good and the banter between Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood was highly engaging- but reminiscent of many ""buddies"" from many different movies. There was little original here.

The strange character of Danger was, well, strange. In the end he seemed to exist primarily so A) Eastwood could say grumpy things about him thus appearing to be gruff and lovable at the same time, and B) so Morgan Freeman could have a moment of glory when he punches out Danger's tormentor. I didn't mind these moments in the plot, but we must admit that they are not the stuff of genius. Disney provided countless similar moments in their live action movies of the seventies (See the Herbie series).

The boxing was utterly unbelievable for anyone who has actually watched boxing. However it was amusing to see Hilary knock out boxer after boxer much to her coach's- Clint's- exasperation.

The final opponent- the evil woman who cheats and knocks Hilary out- would surely have been suspended several times based on the behavior depicted in the film. This might not be obvious to everyone- but boxing is not professional wrestling.

Hilary's family is so ridiculously evil that I have to laugh when I remember them. The scenes of Hilary sitting by the hospital window day after day while her family went to Disneyland were painful- but not in the way they were meant to be.

The final scenes seem like a vote for euthanasia and I felt a little ripped off. There is a great deal that's implausible in these scenes. Where does Clint find the needle and the drugs? How does he know what to do? Why don't the nurses on duty catch on? Why isn't there an investigation? But even more importantly- there was no need for the secrecy. As far as I understand, Hilary needed to be on a ventilator or she would die. There is no law that says you have go on a ventilator- at least not in the province where I live. She could have requested to be removed from the machine and died peacefully, without Clint's apparent heroics.

Overall, very disappointing for a movie that was so hyped by critics. There was nothing outstanding about it. What was fun was far from original. What was bad was so bad that it seriously cripples the whole thing.

I can't imagine why intelligent critics loved it in such large numbers. Had this movie been released in February, I believe many people would have cooled toward it by the time Oscar season rolled around. Now I fear it may displace superior movies at the awards show, causing future critics and fans to scratch their heads.",3
1 February 2006,To Train or Not to Train ***,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004.

And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

Million Dollar Baby is basically about a tough woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who lives for boxing and wants to go as far as she can with it. Therefore, she finds the right person she wants to train and manage her and refuses to quit until he accepts her. As you can imagine, the boxing plays a huge role in this story but around half way to three quarters of the way through, the movie takes an unexpected dark turn. I don't go into many details because I don't want to spoil it. I saw this movie without hearing a thing about it and I believe it was much better not knowing what to expect or even what kind of movie it starts off as and metamorphoses into.

I know from what I have written, the movie seems a bit cliché'd, and certain parts may be, but the movie itself is nothing but a cliché. It is a great story that is more about the boxer than boxing. While I was expecting somewhat of a female Rocky, it became something quite different. If you are expecting another Girl Fight, Honeybee, etc., look someplace else because you will get well more than expected here.

Hilary Swank plays the boxer very convincingly. She obviously went through an immense amount of training to ready herself for this role and I have to say, she nailed it. Not only does she show us what she has in the ring, she shows us she can act with the best of them.

I like to compare Clint Eastwood to John Wayne. Not just here but in almost every movie. They are similar because they always play the same roles. Some people may hate me for saying this, but this is the first Eastwood film that I really liked. Blood Work was all right, but this movie is much better. I give him kudos for his director and producing talents here. Anyone can act the same part for 50 years and get it right. I don't mean this as an insult, but just so you know not to expect anything new from him.

Morgan Freeman plays Eddie Dupris, a former boxer who is narrating the story. He also seems to be a mediator between Frankie (Eastwood) and Maggie, at least until Frankie accepts her.

Add Danger (Jay Baruchel) for comic relief as the semi-retarded wannabe boxer and you have a nice little movie.

Million Dollar Baby is an outstanding movie which I can compare to American Beauty in 1999. I went into both without expectations and left knowing that I had seen something great and simply put, brilliant. 10/10",
19 March 2016,Well Made but Hardly Worth Best Picture.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",7
22 January 2005,Against All Odds...,"It took me awhile to get into ""Million Dollar Baby."" Like all of Eastwood's latter day helmed films, it's snail-paced, darkly lit to the point of annoyance, and at times deafeningly quiet. I thought I had paid to see an underdog triumphs story, a rote boxing pic about an old dog of a trainer (Eastwood) reluctantly teaching a down-and-out youngster (Hillary Swank-amazing here and finally delivering on the promise of her breakthrough performance in ""Boys Don't Cry""). The intimate details of boxing and using the sport as life metaphor are done well here, but nothing special.

Then, about three quarters of the way through the film, it takes a turn I was not aware it would take, and I was blindsided, and then treated to a bearing of Eastwood's soul as an actor and a director, as a man and an artist...an honest and unflinching tribute to the life and philosophies of the noble outsider, the person living by their own set of morals and values, the person who does what is right even when it flies in the face of standard practices and laws. In the shadows of the tragedy that the last quarter of the film depicts, we get treated to Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Swank bearing all, and giving heartbreaking and devastating performances that haunted me long afterwords. Say what you will about Eastwood as a director (he's usually overrated) and as an actor (he usually plays himself), but he gives us a blazing look here into his perspective of the world, and it is both tragic and beautiful to watch in ""Million Dollar Baby.""",9
8 January 2022,Fantastic,"The U-turn this film takes is one for the ages, and gives the film an emotional element to go along with its inspirational main character. Hilary Swank is extraordinary in every aspect, infusing her character with authenticity and looking every bit a real boxer. She makes this movie worth seeing, even if you're not a fan of the sport. Clint Eastwood is great too, though the script relies a little too much on the crusty old men shtick, and uses Morgan Freeman in a way I've seen too many times to truly enjoy, narration and all. The depiction of the welfare family is a little cartoonish and the dialogue at times is mediocre, but those quibbles aside, my goodness, the film packs quite a wallop. I liked how each phase of the story gripped the heart in some way, and had genuine tension. I also liked how the backstory for Eastwood's character, his alienation from his daughter, is never fully explained. There is a certain depth to how the ending raises moral questions, and Eastwood's performance in these scenes is among my favorite of his career. It evokes the W. B. Yeats poem quoted in the film:

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee, And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evening full of the linnet's wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey, I hear it in the deep heart's core.",8
16 February 2005,No gratuitous sex but eye-averting violence,"Well it is nearly always one or the other isn't it. Mostly I don't care for Clint Eastwood, though he can be terrific - ""Play Misty for Me"" being one example that comes to mind, but here he gives a performance that is completely believable, low-key and complex.

Here he plays Frankie Dunn, an older boxing coach and manager of a tacky male-only boxing gym. He goes to daily Mass and argues with the parish priest about matters of faith, he learns Gaelic and he keeps an old boxer, his helper (who is the narrator of the movie)living in a small room off the gym floor. Frankie is buttoned down, does not show his emotion but we are given hints that life has been hard on him, relationships have been destroyed and broken.

Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank)comes on the scene. She's a thirty-something hillbilly woman from southwest Missouri with a big dream which is nearly impossible to attain, she is too old, too broke and a woman to boot. But she inveigles her way into the gym and practically lives there, training incessantly.

I will not spoil the outcome, it works its way into your heart without being melodramatic or over the top Hollywood.

Hilary's performance is just as good as it was in ""boys Don't Cry"", she seems to immerse herself in these one of a kind roles and you are literally stunned at what she can do with them. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Maggie.

Morgan Freeman does a wonderful turn as Dunn's right-hand man, but it is Clint't direction and performance that puts the stamp of overall excellence on this movie. 8 out of 10.",8
31 January 2005,The most human film in years,"After reading all the reviews, I still did not know what to expect out of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (""MDB""). Was it a female ""Rocky""? Or was it about relationships? Well, after watching this film last night, I have to say that this is one of those films that is more about people and human nature than anything else.

Clint Eastwood as a film maker has done what few actor/directors have done: make a succession of films that have gotten more mature and better with age. He started tackling complicated issues such as murder, mythology, and feminism with ""Unforgiven"" (which almost single-handedly deconstructed the Western genre), and then went after other great dramas with ""Mystic River"", ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", and ""The Bridges of Madison County"". However, Mr. Eastwood has proved to be a master of exploring humans with ""Million Dollar Baby"" If I was to summarize this film, I'd give a lot of the movie away and ruin the experience. So let me clarify a few things to get you prepared. It is not a female ""Rocky""--""Rocky"" was about a chance of a lifetime; ""MDB"" is more complicated, exploring themes of determination, taking chances, and courage. Secondly, it is only partially about boxing. While we do learn about the intricacies of boxing, it does a better job about exploring the minds of the people involved. Finally, these characters are people who you know in your life, and they are not treated with kid gloves; everything is presented straightforward, with nothing to hide.

If you are looking for a plot, I can say that there is a very skimpy one. However, like a good story, it bonds you to all the characters, and in the end, you will be jolted. Along with ""Unforgiven"", this is his masterpiece. Hillary Swank is making her way to be the next great actress since Meryl Streep. Clint Eastwood courageously shows more emotion and range than he ever has on film. And Morgan Freeman, who is usually portrayed as a low talking father figure, adds a good foundation to the film as a whole. Direction is tight, and the score, while simple, is very moving. Forget the big budget blockbusters and give this small film a watch; by far one of the best American films to come out in a while.

17 January 2005,A low key thoughtful piece that pleases by turning away from what we expect,"Frankie Dunn is a grizzled boxing trainer who tries his best to protect his fighters from the pressure of the big shot and prepare them as well as he can. When his most recent hope abandons him for a title shot Frankie is downcast to the point where he humours a hopeless gym regular, Maggie Fitzgerald by agreeing to train her. After a short time her potential is obvious and Frankie starts her out in minor bouts where she is so successful at knocking her opponents out that she struggles to get more bouts arranged. With the big time beckoning, can Maggie continue this trend to her title shot and can Frankie trust her enough to let her try?

My plot summary makes this sound like a very tired and clichéd sports movie then that is intentional because that it how it sounded to me when I heard about it; having seen Girlfight recently I wondered why I should bother with what sounds essentially like a retread of that. And for the majority of the film this is what it appeared to be albeit it a pretty professional and enjoyable genre film. However at some point during the film it moves away from the genre formula and becomes something much more interesting. I won't spoil anything but the plot becomes much more low key and interesting  suffice to say this is not just a clichéd sports movie. However this doesn't mean that it is a brilliant film and I must admit to being a little bewildered by the high praise that everyone seems to be heaping onto it. Lets not forget that it is a genre film for the vast majority and only stands out due to consistent good touches and the different direction at the end making it better. It is all interesting and surprisingly low key but don't expect to be totally blown away  it isn't that sort of film.

The acting is very good and I would suggest that Swank is looking at a second Best Actress Oscar for this simply because we is as good early on as she is at the end and adds character to her performance  a whole history with her family build in just one or two scenes, thanks mainly to her performance. Eastwood is the same  a clichéd character made better by hints of deeper issues; I would have liked more time with him in the film to get to know what has brought him here, but he is good considering the limits he is working within. Freeman is also limited to a very small role but is still pretty good although at times his narration was a bit too much and I felt it was over used  a small mercy was that, when the film became most thoughtful, the narration is significantly dropped to a minimum and we are trusted to think for ourselves.

Overall this is not a perfect film but it is a pretty good one. It is 70% the sports cliché that you expect it to be and 30% something different that is a lot darker, low key and interesting. This is an uneasy mix and doesn't totally work  and changing 30% of a genre movie isn't enough to make me cheer from the rooftops about it but I did enjoy it nonetheless.",
22 December 2004,"brilliant, moving film","Saw Million Dollar Baby last night at a screening, marvelous storytelling, acting and drama. Eastwood dealt with issues of child abuse so powerfully in Mystic River and deals with similarly powerful issues and relationships here. His performance is terrific and Swank is probably due her 2nd Oscar, but will ironically lose to Annette Bening who has never won (Swank edged Bening in 1999). Freeman is wonderful as well.

What will be interesting how red staters deal with this movie. Critic Micheal Medved is already trying to whip up anti-Million Dollar Baby rhetoric by giving away crucial plot twists and saying that he's offended that this film is being released at Christmas. Ugh. Don't let closed minded bigots keep you away from one of the best movies of the year. You owe it to Clint who is in the midst of an amazingly productive era in a long and successful career.

19 June 2005,"the boxing movie for the decade, poignant, funny and beautiful..","Million Dollar Baby, can't get it out of my head.... absolutely brilliant, a deeper movie than at first may seem.

Basically surrounds the on going of a boxing coach/manager (Eastwood) who gets coaxed into helping out a determined 31/32 year old girl (Swank) who wants to be a boxer with the mgr's friend overseeing events and hangs on for the ride (Morgan Freeman). Swank comes from a lower class struggling background from the family from hell.

In some ways it is part Rocky, but it goes it own way, and the emotional roller-coaster of the movie hinges on that the girl becomes like a surrogate daughter for Eastwood as he is cut off from his own estranged daughter.

Very humorous at times, but you can't help be chocked at the end of the film.

Class movie.

23 December 2004,A great movie I can't recommend,"This movie is a piece of work. Acting, direction, cinematography, pace, subject matter. Everything is just perfect. But I still hated it. Why? It's one of the most depressing movies ever made. If slitting your wrists ever crossed your mind, do not see this.

Watching the final half is painful to the point of masochism. More so when Eastwood, Swank and Freeman deliver some of the best performances of their career.

Clint Eastwood will be remembered for two things: As an actor, the ultimate tough guy. As a director, a man who learned the craft of storytelling with a mature, sophisticated style. "" Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Mystic River"" are his first one-two punch of great movies since ""Unforgiven"" and ""A Perfect World"".

30 May 2008,a knockout of a drama,"Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) stars as Frankie, an emotional boxing trainer who takes a determined Maggie under his wing and trains her to compete at competitive levels.

Being a fan of Scorsese's Raging Bull and Michael Mann's Ali, I was eager to see this Oscar winning drama and was able to sit and be engaged into a slow and touching plot about the human spirit.

Eastwood leads the way as Frankie, a man with a whole lot of personal history that keeps him from making quick decisions, and gives a deserved Oscar nominated performance in his picture, which he also directs beautifully. Through the character's history, does Eastwood capitalize on bringing out the character's weaker side and he does it to perfection, though it's not Eastwood who steals the limelight.

Hilary Swank (Boys don't cry) gives an Oscar winning performance as Maggie, another character with the past casting shadows over her judgement and with the characters both having similar characteristics and interests, does a great on screen partnership start to blossom into an emotional tale.

Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) likewise receives an Oscar for his performance as Scraps. Not in the film nearly enough for viewers to get to know him, Freeman does great with what he has. Jay Baruchel plays Danger, a weak person in the mind of so many others and is emotional to watch the character on screen.

After a pretty dull opening does the film pick up as we get to know the characters more and the plot comes intriguing with personal issues the focus in this drama.

The plot is consistent once it gets going and with a strong line of personalities the viewers are thrust into their lives as they deal with personal and professional lives.

The fights are tense and interesting to watch, none more so than the final one of the film, leaving to a sad and dramatic climax.

Stronger than Ali and equally as dramatic as Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby is one of the great boxing dramas ever made with excellent performances which show in a beautifully directed drama.",8
4 February 2005,One in a Million,"Director Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is truly a moving and touching motion picture. Powerful. This power derives from amazing actors, an unflinching and uncompromising screenplay by Paul Haggis, and a master director at the zenith of his power. This is the best movie of the year, and Eastwood's finest work. His gift for simplicity and eloquence is absolutely stunning. In writing this comment and acknowledgment, there is apprehension that I may be missing the same respect and integrity that Eastwood has for his audience. The controversial attention given to the story line, which I will not dwell upon, is warranted-- I suppose. Ultimately, it is a matter of choice. And ultimately, regardless of the power of a movie, it is still a movie. That being said, Hilary Swank who inhabits the role of Maggie Fritzgerald, is my favorite all-time movie hero. Her Maggie has such an earnestness, a purity of heart, and spirit that are awe inspiring. Maggie goes after what she wants with everything she's got. Swank truly gives life and soul to Haggis's words and Eastwood's direction. Swank, aside from undergoing hard physical training to bring tough as nails Boxer Maggie to life, also tempers her with a genuine charm, especially when she breaks out a tiny smile that warms your heart. Swank deserves an Oscar for her performance.

Maggie is trailer trash, and she knows it. She has a fierce intelligence, and black and white sense. She sees being a professional boxer as her only way to make it. Thus, she saves all the money she makes as a waitress, so she can be trained by legendary cut man and trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). At first Frankie dismisses Maggie. Maggie is 31 years old, too old. It takes four years just to train a fighter, and she can't even hit a speed bag. Then Maggie tells him, if she can't make it as a boxer ""...I may as well get a trailer home. Buy a deep fryer, and bag of Oreoes."" That catches our attention much like Frankie's. He takes her on as his charge. Haggis's screenplay based on the stories by F.X. Poole has a stark and authentic quality and consistency that are admirable.

Morgan Freeman as Scraps Dupris is the conscience of ""Million Dollar Baby"", and also it's narrator-- the reason later revealed. Scraps works for Frankie in his Gym. Scraps was a contender years ago. Frankie blames himself for a fight in which Scraps lost the use of his eye. Scraps is the one who first brings Maggie to Frankie's attention. Freeman is a great actor, one never catches him acting. His performance is commanding in it's understated nature. There is a breathtaking scene in the diner, where Scraps tells Maggie how he lost his eye in the fight. He (Freeman) is just talking, and Maggie (Swank) is just listening-- really listening. This is stripped down Eastwood at his best.

Actor Clint Eastwood as trainer Frankie Dunn gives a compelling performance displaying such an ease, strength, and vulnerability. Eastwood is still evolving as an actor. His Frankie has an incomplete relationship with an unseen and estranged daughter. Thus, his relationship with Maggie makes sense. They fill in a missing in each other's life. Eastwood possesses this powerful silent presence, that few actors have. In a scene where Maggie is devastated when her Mom ( an effective Margo Martindale) rejects the house that Maggie bought for her, because this would cut off her Mom's welfare check, Eastwood stands silently outside the doorway. Nothing need be said. On the drive back, Maggie says quietly, ""Frankie, you're all I've got."" He replies ""You've got me."" The chemistry between Eastwood and Swank is magical, and what makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" so special and compelling.

The movie ends quietly, and is absolutely moving. And the audience is also silent. Eastwood's vision always has an authenticity about it. He always respects the intelligence of his audience, and our ability to make our own choices and judgments. I truly applaud all the effort and talent involved in making ""Million Dollar Baby"". I think Eastwood's movie captures all that is courageous, compassionate, and noble.",10
28 February 2018,"Million Dollar Baby might seem like a formulaic sports film, but its core is full of emotion.","Sweet Jesus this was depressing. Like I'm talking soul destroying. The little tiny bit of happiness and glory is absolutely annihilated by the tragic third act. Just like a typical sports drama, a rookie wishes to become a champion (in this case a female) and so they train, win fights and compete in the title match. Yes, we've seen it all before. It's a formula that just works perfectly for the sports genre, so there is no need to alter it. Yet, Clint Eastwood decided to go that extra step further and throw in a plot twist that was ruined by the film's marketing. That issue aside, it was excellently executed and really does create an impact. This isn't just a story about winning boxing and becoming a champion. It's about pursuing your dreams and battling your own personal demons. Trying to make something out of your life. Two juxtaposing personalities makes this abundantly clear. Frankie Dunn gives people opportunities and strives for perfection whereas Eddie Dupris lives his life in regret for not being able to achieve his life's ambition. Maggie comes along with the pain and loss of her past life and is able to connect with these two experienced yet jaded individuals that transcends their sorrow. Through sheer determination of the sport, they battle on together. Like a family they unfortunately never had. Using the sport of boxing, Eastwood turns a simple plot into a subtextual construct about inspiration. Very touching. All performances were outstanding. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood were phenomenal, could watch them all day. Eastwood's direction was incredible, particularly how he filmed the boxing matches. The shots are far away so that you can see the actors fight, as if it was a real boxing match. Paul Haggis' screenplay was sharp and rather cut throat. Eastwood's lines were quite savage which enhanced how fatigued he was. The third act's tonal shift may steer some away but this is a well crafted and well acted sports drama.",8
28 February 2005,The Winner!,"I had the interesting experience of seeing ""Million Dollar Baby"" late yesterday afternoon, an hour or so before the Oscars. Having previously seen most of the other nominees for best picture as well as the performances up for awards, I had no difficulty in figuring out how I would have voted if I'd been eligible. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was the easy winner, as were Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood for best director. This is a small picture by recent Hollywood standards but it is worthy of every honor it received. The only wasted moment in the entire movie comes the near the end when the incompetent young boxing hopeful, earlier beaten to a pulp, returns to try again. I could have done without that. However, the basic story is told with rare economy. Contrast that with ""Ray"" which is distended and directed with monumental self-indulgence by Taylor Hackford, another nominee for best director. I don't know that I would have given the best acting award to Eastwood. Though he combines surface restraint and inner turmoil in a brilliant realization of the trainer/manager to Swank's Maggie, Jamie Foxx certainly had the showier role -- and he was quite good in it. For myself, however, I would have given the Oscar to Don Cheadle for his performance in ""Hotel Rwanda"" as the hotel manager who reluctantly at first but ultimately at great personal cost and risk saves hundreds from slaughter. Swank and Freeman won the prizes they earned, and Clint Eastwood won the two Oscars he most deserved. Scorcese will win some other day.",10
17 February 2005,god's tears,"Frankie went to mass every day for twenty-three years because of guilt he felt about Scrap's lost eye and an undisclosed wrong of his that led his daughter to disown him. Finally, god heard Frankie's plaint and shed a tear for Frankie in the form of Maggie, a muscular bundle of desire and single-minded devotion. Maggie reanimated Frankie. In their short, intense relationship she gave him everything he had lost: a daughter's love, a desire to win (not just to train) and the opportunity to open his heart to her and shed his guilt. At the end, I was not sure that the movie was more of a moving love story or a dark, deep-felt tragedy, just as I am not sure if lemon meringue pie is sweet to the tooth or sour on the tongue. Or both...

13 August 2022,"Million Dollar Baby is much more than a boxing movie. It is a drama about overcoming, courage and determination!","How far are you able to go for a dream? Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows us that there are no limits to getting what we want. Million Dollar Baby didn't get so many awards for nothing. It has its merits, and they are not few. It could just be a boxing movie, but it surprises and proves to be a competent and exciting drama. The 25th feature film directed by Clint Eastwood, which, like The Unforgivable, deservedly took home four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, is a triumph of character studies in an intimate, delicate, and moving approach that is never seen before. Valley of exaggerations or cheap sentimentality to pass on its simple message.

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) has spent his life in the ring, managing and training great boxers. Frankie often teaches the fighters he works with the same lesson he follows for his life: first of all, protect yourself. Hurt with the removal of his daughter, Frankie is a closed person and only relates to Scrap (Morgan Freeman), his only friend, who also takes care of his gym. Until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) comes into his life, a determined young woman who has an unfinished gift for boxing. Maggie wants Frankie to train her, but he doesn't want to train women, and besides, he believes she's too old to start a boxing career. Despite Frankie's denial, Maggie decides to train daily at the gym. She receives support from Scrap, who encourages her to keep going. Overcome by Maggie's determination, Frankie finally accepts being her coach.

In essence, it's just three characters. Frankie Dunn is an aging boxing trainer who runs a run-down gym in Los Angeles where his friend and ex-pupil Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris lives., also, of narrator in a very similar way to the work of the actor in The Shawshank Redemption. Into this masculine and decadent environment, young redneck waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives wanting to train with Frankie, even though he repeatedly says he doesn't train girls. Scrap is that, seeing there a light, a hope in the darkness, he needs to convince his friend to give the young woman a chance, which ends up rekindling an old flame in Frankie.

The relationship between Frankie and Maggie, which Eastwood Lens lovingly builds, isn't a loving one, though. Nor is it something you could call father and daughter, even if there are undeniable contours of it. There is something even deeper there, a co-dependency that is difficult to explain, but which Maggie sums up when she says, after the two of them visit her disgusting mother (played by Margo Martindale), with a simple ""you are all I have"". Maggie sees in Frankie her freedom, freedom to have the chance to pursue a life other than that of a waitress who would undoubtedly end up just like her mother, living in a trailer and living on government aid. Frankie, for her part, carrying guilt on her shoulders related to Scrap that even her daily visit to the Church for 23 can't atone for, has in Maggie a kind of spiritual salvation, but not exactly absolution, but something like her last chance at life. Smile and breathe a sigh of relief, probably for having managed to do something with his life.

Eastwood, the director, extracts exquisite performances from everyone. Swank does her life's work as the hopeful young woman who doesn't want much more out of life than to have a chance to succeed. The way Maggie looks at Frank is a mixture of reverence and thanks, in the same way that she manages to convey genuine love, like a child looking proudly at his father, without the exact awareness that this feeling is more than reciprocal. But it's not just the chemistry between the actress and Eastwood that works well, as one of the most touching scenes in the work is when Maggie and Scrap talk in a restaurant about Frankie, in which we see the actress, practically immobile, give herself so completely to his role, convincing us so deeply of his immersion in his character, that we forget we're watching a movie. Freeman, on the other hand, is the wise man who sees the situation very clearly from the outside looking in and narrating it in a way that only an actor can. As in The Shawshank Redemption, his role in Million Dollar Baby is undeniably very similar to that of Red, the inseparable friend who deeply understands the subject of his observation. The other two Oscar statuettes, for Actress and Supporting Actor, were also surgically given to the two.

However, the Academy failed to award Eastwood despite his Best Actor nomination. If he already deserved the statuette for his work in The Unforgivable, here he reaches his highest point in his acting career. Frankie Dunn is an externally tough man like the vast majority of characters played by Eastwood, but, in Million Dollar Baby, the viewer realizes very clearly that this unbreakable appearance takes a huge and disproportionate price that takes the character away from the world and from more human interactions. Relevant than your connection to Scrap. As is the motto of the feature, at no time does the viewer receive this information about his past chewed up on a silver platter. The script by Paul Haggis is much smarter than that and makes the presence of Father Horvak, played by Brían F. O'Byrne, the most didactic sign of this condition of the protagonist that goes far beyond his past with Scrap. And the final moments of the film leave Eastwood exclusively with the task of making the work work without fussiness, something he sensationally achieves when he finishes transforming his irreducible Frankie into a conduit of love, life and the search for some kind of happiness.

As a director, Eastwood noticeably evolves. It's okay that he exaggerates when he villainizes Maggie's opponent's boxers - a primary mistake that risks playing the film in simplest - but the filmmaker's successes are greater than the slips. Take, for example, his portrayal, at the same time affectionate and implacable, of the customs and people of the South of the USA - the character Danger, by the great actor Jay Baruchel, with his thick accent and his excessive self-confidence, is a rare find. Eastwood's courage to develop extreme situations, both visually and metaphorically, such as the signing of the contract in the hospital, is something that is not normally seen in a prudish industry like the North American one.

The director is equally careful and delicate, transforming Frankie's gym into the beating heart of his feature, the place where everything most relevant happens as a true character. It is there that hopelessness and loneliness give way to hope and connection, with the music composed by the director underlining this transformation. But shadows are very important in Million Dollar Baby. They set the mood and mark the beginning and end of the work with a flawless photograph by Tom Stern, who has been with Eastwood since his debut in this chair in Debt of Blood. Using a lot of natural light and letting the shadows completely take over the narrative in some moments, sometimes even hiding the actors - notice the phenomenal lighting in the sequence where Maggie and Frankie talk in the car or the very long shadows in the final sequences -, bathing them in an air of melancholy and hopelessness.

Million Dollar Baby is much more than a boxing movie. And look, they talk about it almost all the time. I can say that they breathe boxing. It's strong, heavy, surprising. It is a drama about overcoming, courage and determination. Maggie had everything to give up her career: financial difficulties, a little old age for boxing (as Frankie said) and a family that didn't support her and only thought about financial compensation. But she didn't give up and fought until the end. This is a very simple work, full of subtleties, which moves us and teaches us that we cannot give up on our dreams.

It's certainly one of the best films Eastwood has directed, considering at least About Boys and Wolves and The Unforgivable in this feud, but the film certainly seems to be the most mature and most human of the actor-turned-filmmaker's vast body of work. An audiovisual triumph that enchants and excites without dictating feelings and without ever betraying its proposal. Hollywood has already given audiences boxing masterpieces, such as Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980). They are classics precisely because they borrow sport as a motto to talk about life. And as much as it looks like a traditional film, Million Dollar Baby shows its authorial value between the lines. Knowing when to resist and also when to let your guard down is your most valuable lesson for the real world.",8
20 February 2005,Oh Yeah Go Baby,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

2 February 2021,Heartwrenching and reflective movie...,"I had always been curious about this movie because is considered by many among the best movies from 2004, it's the only movie for which Morgan Freeman won the Academy Award and it was directed and acted by Clint Eastwood (who has an amazing track record as both director and actor) so I knew I had to see it! And this movie, other than loving it, it made me reflect a lot.

In the first hour and 20 minutes this is a boxing movie. A young woman (Hilary Swank) is determined to become a champion of female boxing. In doing so he begs a traines that has a reputation for training worldwide known champions, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). Dunn at the beginning is reluctant, but with also some advice by the gym cleaner and best friend Eddie Scrap Iron Dupris (Freeman) he accepts to train her. At first it all goes well and she is recognized as a world champion, and her dream is accomplished. However during one fight she falls in the ring and after hitting her head on the chair she becomes paralyzed and is taken to an hospital... and then the movie becomes better but darkest. It asks the question ''Do we have an innate right to die?'' when we think there is no apparent quality in life. It's an important and ethical question that no one never asks. And I am sure that many viewers after they saw this movie wanted to discuss this subject with the family members or friends. Few movies will make you think like MILLION DOLLAR BABY does... this, combined with great acting and a terrific script, makes for one of the best movies of the decade and it's no surprise it even won the Academy Award for Best Movie.

Overall, I think I said a lot about this movie and many said everything that had to be said about it so it will leave it here. A must see to all fans of great movies! And it should be shown also in movie schools.",10

1 August 2005,Excellent Performances,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is perfectly cast --- the actors take on their parts and make them their own. The story is about a white trash girl, Maggie, who wants to make something of herself and believes that boxing is her calling. She seeks out Frankie to train her at the gym, but he refuses to take her on at first. At first you think Frankie's sexist, but his character is not that simple. The story builds steadily and you later realize Frankie has many good reasons not to train Maggie, but her spirit and dedication win him over eventually. Frankie ties himself emotionally to each person he trains and tries his best to make them champions. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Scrap the gym's custodian and his intelligence and ability to decipher Frankie even surprises Frankie. Scrap reminds me of a man I met one time at my company who earned a purple heart in the Vietnam War, but spent his days sorting mail in the mail room. Surely, this veteran had more to offer the world or maybe I just didn't understand that he had experienced and accomplished more than most people do in a lifetime. I think the situation is the same with Scrap -- being at the gym doing whatever is still immensely satisfying to him. How many people can say they'd want to live at their place of work like Scrap?! Hillary Swank is wonderful as Maggie and Clint Eastwood... well what's not to like? The man is brilliant in every way -- acting, directing, writing, and so soft spoken in real life that you love and respect him even more.

I also was immensely impressed by the minor players in the film, especially the actor who plays Maggie's mother, Margo Martindale. She is just excellent in her supporting role. Lucia Rijker is also fantastic as ""Billie the Blue Bear"". She is one tough lady! It wasn't until I watched the behind the scenes footage that I saw how pretty she is off screen.

One minor problem I can see with the film is the diction and audibility -- I couldn't understand everything Scrap said and had to use the subtitles feature on the DVD player. I understood all of his narration, but not some of his lines when he appeared on film. My complaint sounds like nitpicking and that's not my intention.

Finally, it is great to finally see a major film about women's boxing. I didn't know the women's version is just as violent as the men's. I am quite surprised boxing headgear is not worn in women's or men's boxing. Boxing with your bare head makes no sense when you see how many injuries are sustained such as concussions, broken eardrums, detached retinas, and such. The sport makes complaining about a broken nose sound like you're complaining about a broken finger nail. I've heard some of Muhammad Ali's present health condition is attributed to numerous blows to his head during his boxing years.

Overall this is an excellent film and well worth the time viewing.",8
8 September 2020,A disturbing drama about the highs and lows of boxing.,"This is a very accomplished picture (directed by Eastwood) about the fight game but one that is troublesome and without giving too much away, truly disturbing (In fact so much so, I don't think I'll be revisiting this one). Such films to me are way more scary than any horror movie and total respect for anyone (man or women) brave enough to climb through the ropes. Life can't get much darker than this so make sure you are in a high spirited mood before watching.

31 August 2005,T.k.o.!!,"Million dollar baby"" is a complete winner of a film. This is actually an Oscar recipient that is hard to dispute. Knockout performances from Freeman, Eastwood, and especially Swank. It's really hard not to be moved by this film once it has been seen in its entirety.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is laced with just the right amount of honesty, comedy, integrity, action, drama, and tragedy. It really is a beautiful peace of work that should equally appeal to both sexes and audiences of every age. This film definitely has it all.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a movie that is not worth describing the plot for, as it really must be seen to be appreciated and respected. Swank and especially Eastwood should be proud of what they have given us. A crowning achievement for two outstanding performers.

If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and make it the next movie on your list. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is without a doubt a landmark film and and a new American classic.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",10
29 January 2005,"Probably the Greatest Film on Boxing, Period","This has to be one of, if not, the finest films ever done on the sport of boxing. The fight scenes are great, but its the gentler moments between Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood that help make this film what it is. However, the true glue of this film is Morgan Freeman. He definitely provides a true center as the narrator of the story. It is his gentle nature that helps make this film an all time classic. Also, this is a great story about relationships. You pretty much can see this as Frankie pretty much establishes with Maggie, the relationship that he wishes that he could have had with his own daughter. This relationship really comes to a head especially at the end.

The other thing that I really liked about the film is that unlike most boxing films, it doesn't end with the big bout that sees her win the title and become champion. Instead, it uses that scene to pretty much set up the real strong part of the film. This film is definitely a great film not only on boxing, but on relationships as well.

17 March 2005,Is this moving really about boxing?,"I must begin by confessing that I hate boxing. So I'll make this comment notwithstanding that. Well but is this movie really about boxing? I don't think so, I mean, in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love, friendship, dedication, will strength and fighting spirit for an aim. The main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player, a singer, a dancer or a pianist. And this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned. This movie is made with a, shall we say, atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it. The outcome, though caused by a fortuitous (or not?) fact, inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters (or three if we consider that the old ex-boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events, playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint). I think we are perhaps in presence of one of the best 2004 movies if not the best one.

15 July 2005,"You don't have a video library if you don't own this one, and you haven't been to the movies if you haven't seen it.","Where do I begin? OK, how about this. Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman. Hillary Swank. Read that list again. Repeat it aloud like you were learning a list of holy sacraments for catechism. These aren't actors. These are national treasures. Consider yourself lucky to be able to see any one of them in a movie. To have a movie with the three of them in starring roles, that's not luck, that's manna from heaven. Eastwood, Freeman. These are stars well established in the firmament, and either could elevate even the most prosaic of films into something magical. But this is no prosaic film. It's magic is overwhelming.

But take note. A new star shines throughout this movie, even in the brilliant light of the infallible Eastwood and Freeman, and I am at a loss to begin to describe her magnificence. Radiant. Beautiful. Brilliant. Let me know when you get the idea, so I can go on. Hillary is stunning, breathtaking. Her subtle and nuanced performance is beyond description. She's a white trash would be fighter, too old to train and it doesn't matter anyway 'cause Eastwood ""don't train girls."" But she saves tips and scrapes plates and buys a speed bag, and well, why not? And suddenly, she's a contender.

And just when we thought this was going to be another Schlocky Rocky ain't it touching 'cause the underdog wins piece of crap movie, we are reminded oh so powerfully that this is, after all, a Clint Eastwood movie. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood all won Oscars, as did the film itself for Best Picture. But that only beings to suggest how unbelievably spectacular this film really is.

The film's third act the stuff of cinema history. It will be remembered among the greatest achievements Hollywood has produced; and will rightfully call the likes of The Godfather, Rocky, and Raging Bull peers. You don't have a video library if you don't own this one, and you haven't been to the movies if you haven't seen it.",10
23 September 2005,Best cliché you'll see for sometime,"This film has received criticism for its use of clichés; and the clichés are here, and they are plentiful. But the production, direction, and acting breathe life into them to the extent that most of them are unnoticeable, and a few are even welcome. Morgan Freeman's character is pure formula, but to the extent that he is an excellent actor, who cares? and to the extent that this IS a ""boxing"" movie, where would it be without such a retired ""old-school"" boxer (punched-out eye and all) to comment on the nature of the sport? The fact is, the construction is so well-done that it is hard not to watch the film all the way through. And the main characters are, on the whole, very likable; we care about them.

A well-made, memorable presentation, even if we have seen these elements before.

18 April 2022,Amazing perfomances,"Maggie is unuaul for a female protagonist in that she is uneducated, unrefined and poor; she isn't smart, witty, young, pretty or have much in the way of street smarts.

What she does have is a big heart, determination and a strong right hook.

Hillary Swank absoltuly smashed this out the park, her perfomance is so strong I was instantly gripped -even though I have no interest in boxing.

Clint and Morgan look very comfortable playing parts that were obviosuly written for them.

Other reviewers have called this a girl's rocky - it really isnt.

With Rocky its just a matter of time before Eye of the Tiger ramps up and he pushes himself off the canvas and knock the other guy out - this is more grounded.

In reality, working-class people rarely get a free lunch and any success comes at a price.",8
19 February 2005,Another fine hour for Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood follows up last year's refined Mystic River, with Million Dollar Baby. The movie starts in a tired and kind of worn out boxing gym in a not too exclusive part of LA. Clint Eastwood's Frankie is the owner, a old and stubborn trainer for some boxers. His sidekick is Morgan Freeman's Eddie, he's the man that runs the gym, an old boxer himself that clean the floors, do some plumbing, give the boxers some words of wisdom when they are in need of it and so on. Into this gym trip's Hilary Swank's Maggie, energetic and determined to go as far as a title shot. What she also wants is Frankie to manage for her so she can get the proper training, but Frankie is made of the old school and that don't involves training girlies. But with her rock hard determination and maybe with some help from Eddie they can wear old Frankie down.

This movie was a satisfaction to watch from the beginning, the three lead actors are all at their peak. They have some really strong roles to work with here. Frankie has characteristics with roles we have seen Eastwood done before, he works every angle of it and it results in a well deserved Oscar nomination. Swank is also very good, thrust worthy in the hard-hitting boxing sequences and wonderful as the happy human being she is. Freeman's quiet but always observing retired boxer is another enjoyment to see, a supporting role and Freeman serves it with big chunks that go a long way.

With his 25th film as a director Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a story, he does it both sensitive and powerful. A moving film to carry with you. Million Dollar Baby has Oscar nominations in all the heavy categories, I hope it takes two or three statues with it home, it deserves it.",9
9 March 2005,One of the Best Best Pictures,"In recent memory, no Best Picture has deserved its honor more than Million Dollar Baby. Not Gladiator, not Chicago, not A Beautiful Mind, not even The Return of the King. All of those films were notable for certain wonderful aspects, but in some way or another, they just don't reach the zenith of cinema that is Million Dollar Baby. I'll confess, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. That alone, however, isn't enough for me when critiquing his films. I liked Mystic River, but its third act was (to put it very kindly) weak. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a western, but no Clint Eastwood effort that I've yet seen tears open its heart so honestly and nakedly as this film. This film is all about the essence of life and living, and the debate raged by Michael Medved and other political hacks cannot detract from its impact on any viewer. Beating Saving Private Ryan, it's the closest a film has come to making me cry in a theater. I almost did, and it's my own fault for not letting in enough, but that's beside the point. The point here? Million Dollar Baby is an excellent film, rich with character, plot, and unspeakable heartache. You have to see it immediately, and try to hold back (like I did) when Eastwood visits his priest the last time. I won't give away any more than that.",10
9 March 2005,Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels,"On the one hand, Million Dollar Baby is probably the most masterfully acted and beautifully crafted movie of the year, thoroughly deserving all four of its Oscars. But on the other, it lacks the originality and all-round satisfaction provided by fellow nominee Sideways.

You know what you're going to get with a Clint-directed film; usually a story of human failings told through rich but moody visuals at an unhurried pace in unsexy locations. When he breaks out of this mould, you get Firefox, The Rookie and Space Cowboys.

M$B teams spunky hick chick wannabe-boxer Maggie with grouchy mentor Frank, puts them on the road to success and then runs them off it in an extremely tragic manner. Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels.

Clint combines power with light-footedness in the gym and in the ring, but some of the dramatic scenes suffer from screenwriter Paul Haggis's leaden, hackneyed dialogue which clumsily telegraphs each of the tragic events to come. But the actors, and Swank in particular, deliver it faultlessly.

This is a movie about taking your chance when it comes, living for the moment and having faith in people, not religion (tellingly, the only 'f' word in the film is uttered by a priest). It is a thought-provoking and captivating film of unquestionable quality, but the idea of the working class girl with a boxing dream was realised recently, and perfectly adequately, in Girlfight. Originality is what makes a film great, so in that respect, M$B is a worthy contender rather than a true champion.",9
22 April 2005,Well deserving of its Oscars,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress.

13 January 2021,impossible not to release tears,"This one of the most sad movies I've seen so far. Comparable in sadness and topic to Changeling (2008), Prison Break (2005) and Run (2020). Topic is serious, realistic and good, and it is not only sports or competition, but also humanity, faith, being injured, sick, and risking. Feelings of desperation, hope, disappointment dominate. Feeling is similar to encountering death, accident, loss in real life. Good actors who look like real trainers and sports players. Deep. But bad is the obvious negativity, even tough it's real. Best to watch for sports lovers and those not sensitive to negative stuff like injury, loss, and death.

18 January 2006,"Wow, what a great show! Eastwood's just getting better!","I personally am not a huge fan of boxing movies or any other films falling into that kind of category. However, I have to say that Million Dollar Baby, with the legendary Clint Eastwood as lead actor and more importantly, as director, made this movie into a masterpiece. It just works wonderfully on every level necessary to make a great movie. Along with Clint, we have Hilary Swank and the also well-known Morgan Freeman, who won on Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie.

Million Dollar Baby is a great movie with tremendous good boxing action and later on, heart-breaking drama that will bring tears to your eyes. The bond between the two main characters and what eventually happens to one of them just rips anybody's soul apart. And I just love how Morgan Freeman is playing an in-the-background, but equally important character. He definitely deserved the Oscar he won.

And Clint deserved what he got as well. Just like he had done with his hit Western ""Unforgiven"", he made a great movie out of this by directing and playing the lead role in this. He did a great job as a cantankerous and rough boxing trainer who eventually realizes that he can have a heart.",10
12 February 2005,Better than a million bucks,"Honestly, there was little doubt that this film would be good. With the actors, the director the talent, it was a sure hit. And yet, it still somehow exceeds expectations. First and foremost, Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing film. Yes, boxing is in it. There are boxing matches. Many of the characters are connected because of boxing. But through this the film reaches for so much more than simply telling the story of a boxer and her trainer. Instead, the film ultimately tackles issues of faith, love, life, fate, will, strength and ultimately asks one of the greatest questions of all: what does it mean to live? That's not to say there aren't any cliché's in the film. As hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald goes against all odds to reach her dream of fighting for the world championship there is a hint of familiarity in her efforts that comes in the form of Rocky or real life boxer Jake La Motta (spotlighted in Raging Bull.) Yet, for every cliché there is an original element wholly unique to this story.

Moreover, the characters become real. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn begins as a grumpy, old man who wishes not to train Maggie because she is both a girl and too old. Hmm where has this been seen before? But then, it does not end there, and the journey Frankie as well as the rest of the characters face does not lead to familiar territory but rather to a myriad of difficult questions, leaving the viewer with no easy answers. This film does not end with everything tied up in a neat little bow.

What Million Dollar Baby does do, though, is leave an impact. Seldom becoming manipulative and always holding a quiet grace, much like in both of Eastwood's previous films Unforgiven and Mystic River, it takes ideas used before and breathes new life into them. The style Eastwood directs with is unmistakable and the emotion he creates unforgettable.

Then there is the ending. Recently much controversy has come from some of the choices made by characters at the end of the film, with political commentators condemning the film (Rush Limbaugh is a big example) and some major published reviews even spoiling the end of the film because of its supposed ""political ambitions."" It's unfortunate, and the hubbub is completely silly. Eastwood has said himself that he meant the film as a story, not a quick answer to a political problem of today. Sometimes the characters an actor will play or the story a director will tell aren't necessarily their point of view. That's why acting is called acting; a character is created. A story is told to transport as well as reflect.

Furthermore, much of these complaints likely come from people who haven't even seen the film (it's sadly reminiscent of the butchering Martin Scorsese received for his work The Last Temptation of Christ.) Even more ironic is the fact that the very viewpoints of the attackers of this film are brought up and questioned within the narrative itself. Overall, it's best to see Million Dollar Baby without any knowledge of the ending or even the major plot points, and to instead let the film tell its story. This is art, subtle but never compromising, an example of Eastwood at his best and of cinema at it's finest.",9
30 January 2005,THE movie of 2004,"I saw The Aviator, as well as all the other movies nominated as best picture for the Academy Awards. The Aviator was top of my list until today. This movie is one of the most stirring I have seen in a long while. The acting is superb. Hilary Swank was incredible. Not to take away from the amazing job Cate Blanchett did in The Aviator, but Hilary gets my vote above all the rest. Clint is among the best there is today at making movies. The cinematography is wonderful - the use of lighting is excellent. The use of silence is outstanding. And Morgan Freeman continues to blow me away! I laughed and cried(hard)with the characters, and marveled at the performances of the actors.

Ya gotta see this one! It'll tear your heart out.

Million Dollar Baby is the kind of movie that gets you in the gut. Three days after I saw it I am still thinking about it.

Hilary Swank is fantastic and deserves Oscar and of course Morgan Freeman gives an outstanding performance.

There are the usual whinersand complainers about Clints views on religion, disabilities and on and on. Get a life people. Its a MOVIE! Meant to make one think and ponder.

There just aren't any younger actors with the talent and drive to replace Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman when they retire. There are a lot of wannabes but no real talent. This is one GREAT movie.",8

18 April 2006,This is Eastwood's mature vision,"Beautifully written, produced, acted; Eastwood continues to grow, and it's great to see that. May he continue to be the maverick who takes on stuff like this and do things few dare to do.

You can't ask for better; a movie which says everything that needs to be said about the choice to make the search for truth one that involves a fight. For Dunn, life is a fight. Contenders for claims to the divine must run through searing heat, so the dross burns off and what comes out the other side is pure gold. This movie pushes us right into the volcano. Do we come out with or without hope that this process produces something ultimately beautiful? Sorry, but this movie declines to convince or reassure. That is for each of us to decide at the movie's end, just as we will have to assess at our lives' ends. If that sounds like a ""stone bummer, man,"" then don't watch this film.

This movie joins others, like Fellini's Nights of Cabiria, that dare to leave us with no clear and pat conclusions about the fates of the protagonists. In the end, the real issue involves our feelings as we face life's challenges--and deal with the outcomes, both desired and undesired. Will your final take on the fates of Dunn and his protégé relate in any way to your own life decisions as you face your future?",10
28 February 2005,My favorite film of 2004,"Clint Eastwood's latest work, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, stars Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerlad, a poor 31 year old woman who has aspirations of making it big as a boxer and wants nothing but the guidance of an old ""cut man"", Frankie Dunn. At first, Frankie is hesitant on training Maggie due to the fact that she's a girl and claims that girls are not tough enough. Morgan Freeman's character, Scrap, decides to help Maggie and angers Frankie in the process. Frankie has managed some great fighters in the past and doesn't want to take a chance on a near middle aged trailer park girl. Frankie and Maggie then begin a special bond that is without a doubt one of the best stories ever told in the history of film.

The Academy did indeed pick the right winner for Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Best Supporting. I hope Clint continues to make spectacular films in the future and wish nothing but the best for him, Hilary and Morgan. My favorite film of 2004. A+

21 January 2006,"""Million Dollary Baby"" - a knockout","I'm amazed at the strength of this movie, ""Million Dollar Baby."" I'm also amazed at how far its director and lead actor, Clint Eastwood, has progressed as a filmmaker. (It's easy to see that his ""Dirty Harry"" days are way behind him.) Since 1992's ""Unforgiven,"" we've seen an insightful, straightforward way of storytelling from the actor-turned-director, who has developed the most unique talent of any filmmaker alive today, which is to understand his characters and present them in a significant, but not overstated fashion that brings about their emotions, pains, and successes. His latest film, adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis from stories printed in ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" by the late F.X. Toole, searches the souls of three people in the boxing ring of life. The first is old and tired gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the type of world-weary character Eastwood specializes in, who knows the ring inside-out and reads poetry in his spare time. The second is hillbilly (white trailer trash?) Maggie Fitzgerald (a knockout powerhouse played by Oscar-winner Hilary Swank), who thinks boxing is the only way out of her job as a waitress, which she has been doing since the tender age of 13. Frankie reluctantly takes her under his wing and their path leads her on an escapable course with destiny. She trains hard, sweats hard, knocks out the competition in one round for several bouts (a feat that embarrasses the daylights out of certain managers), and a chance at a title shot if she can unseat the brutal Billie ""The Blue Bear"" (Lucia Rijker). She makes a complete turnaround in character, going from bright-eyed rookie to seasoned professional, and the way the film tracks her progress is relayed to us beautifully. Lastly, there is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the story's narrator. Scrap is sincere in his narration in yet another world-weary manner like Eastwood and doesn't twist or play with his words to make points. As a former fighter who Frankie once trained, he's blind in one eye, out of the ring, but possess the wisdom worthy of one to tell a story like Frankie and Maggie's. It's not hard to see why Roger Ebert showered it with praise; nothing in his review convinced me he was lying. The raw power of ""Million Dollar Baby"" lies in the performances and straightforward narrative of the story, all of which I described earlier. It won four Oscars and two Golden Globes, though sadly enough the emotional score that Eastwood himself composed didn't win anything. This is the best movie about boxing and boxers I've seen since ""Rocky"" (1976). But right there is the distinction. ""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't so much about boxing and winning the title as it is a close inspection of the relationship of three different people. ""Rocky"" is about that one shot, that one chance to make something of yourself; this film is about living those dreams. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a knockout.

10/10",10
22 January 2005,Million Dollar Movie!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. For me it ranks up there with The Shawshank Redemption. If you loved Shawshank, I promise you, you will love this. Both movies handle a subject we have seen many times before and do it so well that you can not imagine how it could ever be done any better. In this case, the done-to-death story-line is about a fighter who wants to get her shot at the title and the hard-headed trainer who reluctantly takes her on. Don't be fooled by the story-line though. This is no Rocky. Million Dollar Baby is to Rocky as a diamond is to some cheap quartz imitation.

Hilary Swank creates such a believable character you'll have a hard time thinking she was acting. I hope to see her in the Oscars in some designer dress with a two-thousand dollar hair-do. I will be glad in more ways than one since it will destroy my image of her as an honest, hard-working, tough and yet vulnerable woman worth loving.

Morgan Freeman is absolutely and utterly wonderful, again, as usual.

As for Clint Eastwood. Well, some actors and directors get better with age. Clint Eastwood isn't just getting better. He is so far ahead of his contemporaries already he'll have to cut off an arm (well maybe both arms and possibly a leg) to let the others catch up with him.

After seeing this movie I thought about it a long time trying to understand why it had such an emotional effect on me. Deep down I guess its about choosing your road in life and going where it takes you. No complaints. No regrets. What really hits home is the love the characters have for one another. The sort of love you reserve for people who walked down that road with you. The people who you'd want to be with in your final moments.

I can not understand the mind-set of people who voted 1 for this movie. I can only guess they are other movie directors. Excellent 10/10.",10
5 February 2005,Another Eastwood winner!!!,"Well I just returned form the cinema, and what can I say?? WOW!!! Captivating from the start and even though at some point it even made me believe it would be very predictable...I could not be more wrong.

This is a very powerful film that portrays two strong minded people very different but very similar in the sense that they always follow their instincts no matter what and they take this to the very end.

Without wanting to spoil this for those that have not seen it I can only say: THIS IS A FILM YOU MUST WATCH!!!

I was though sad to see an ageing Eastwood, but I guess you can't beat the clock.

2 April 2005,The Best Picture of the Year!,"On the outside 'Million Dollar Baby' seems like a boxing picture, but it's really a character study of the three characters involved (played expertly by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman). Before I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a tacky and sappy girl boxing movie, but it wasn't. I find even after I've seen it, it's hard to convince people the film is not like that, and it's not a conventional formulaic boxing film like Rocky, but that it is something a hell of a lot deeper. After seeing the film for a second time, I found that it really has no weak points other then being a little slow towards the beginning (which was essential in order to tell the story correctly.) Clint Eastwood not only does an outstanding job directing this soon-to-be-classic, but he also produces the film, composes a spellbinding musical score, and gives his very best screen performance as Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck boxing manager who decides to take on a wannabe female boxer. Morgan Freeman provides us with a quiet yet extremely effective performance as Frankie's long-time friend and partner. Not only does Freeman play this part, but his character narrates the story, so the whole movie is told from this character's perspective. The on-screen chemistry between Eastwood and Freeman is too incredible for words, a chemistry that was only once before seen in 1992's Best Picture winner 'Unforgiven', that was also made by Eastwood. The best performance of the film obviously comes from Hilary Swank as the average trailer-trash restaurant waitress who's one true passion is for boxing. Swank delivers a tour-de-force performance, and along with Eastwood it's also her best on-screen acting performance. Ms. Swank knows her character very well, and it shows that she didn't just memorize the lines of the character, but she embodied the character. Overall, when you see the film you don't see the three actors, but the characters they portray. 'Million Dollar Baby' is my choice for Best Picture, along with the Oscars for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing and Best Original Score. However I think Hilary Swank shouldn't be awarded Best Actress, that title belongs to Imelda Staunton who gave definitely one of the best female performances I have ever or probably will ever see in my life in Mike Leigh's 'Vera Drake'.

15 December 2004,A knockout - Trifecta acting; one of Eastwood's best ; Swank's best since winning Oscar,"MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004) **** Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Brian F. O' Byrne, Jay Baruchel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker, Margo Martindale, Bruce MacVittie, Ned Eisenberg.

(Dir: Eastwood) Trifecta acting; one of Eastwood's best ; Swank's best since winning Oscar Clint Eastwood continues his winning streak as film's crusty elder statesman in this absorbing character study about the boxing world with surprises bold and uncompromising  just like his lean, no-frills journeyman film-making trademark has always been.

Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, the grizzled, graying manager of a run-down gym that you could practically smell the blood, sweat and p*ss it has accumulated through the years of would-bes, wannabes and all-too familiar never-was pugilists who've darkened his establishment and worse, led him down the world-weary belief at one last attempt for a sure thing champion fighter title match.

Along comes feisty yet green boxer wannabe Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank, the picture of determination and laser-eyed for the prize moxie), a thirty-something waitress struggling to shake her 'white trash' sack of ashes for a chance at becoming a world-class fighter. Dunn shakes her off from the get go until he wanders in one night to visit his best friend and the gym's caretaker Eddie 'Scraps' Dupris (Freeman, the film's somber voiced narrator as well)  a former boxer whose only memory of glory days gone by is a milky blue glass eye  who instills the plucky young woman with a fortitude to focus on what she is all set to obtain. All she needs is the properly motivated manager and Dunn reluctantly at first accepts this first as a chore to be done with but when he seconds guess his rookie protégée he is given a hard-knocks lesson when he actually sees her raw talent in the ring which needs only his sure hand and in a twist of fate Frankie Dunn's legacy is wrapped up in one solid bout leading to a fighter with some serious unproven talent.

What follows are some wonderfully leisurely paced sequences (liberally sprinkled with humor) as Maggie is shown the ropes in what easily could've been a hackneyed notch to a long-in-the-tooth genre that seems to have been thawed out from Warner Bros.

Golden Age of tough talking' bout flicks of the Thirties and Forties, yet Eastwood eschews the cinematic lineage instead for a very impressive tale of three interlaced story lines and the flesh-and-bones/meat-and-potatoes characters of Frankie, Maggie and Scraps that feels entirely fresh as the viewer gladly goes along the seemingly predictable path line/montage of one unheralded success to the next until the out-of-nowhere left hook/uppercut combo in the film's final act that all I will say is a real tearjerker deftly handled with exceptional restraint by Eastwood and simply allows his family of players to play their cards as they are dealt with : realistically.

Swank continues to impress but you' ll never expect the tough, gritty and wonderful work she does here as the sad but not pathetic Maggie who only wants one thing and that is to be a success at her one talent  boxing. I dare say she is the most honest cinematic fighter since the original ROCKY ; that good.

Freeman is formidably damn good as always as the voice of experience and at times reason but he avoids the tragic path his character easily could've been depicted; instead his usual understated gravitas shines.

Paul Haggis' no-nonsense yet likable screenplay adaptation is based on boxing stories by F.X. Toole. What needs to be recognized is the theme of love throughout and how it can be achieved in the not-so-traditional paterfamilias/lover classifications but an amalgam of just that.

Eastwood resurrects his growling cadence from HEARTBREAK RIDGE but his Frankie Dunn is not a stock character  a loser looking for redemption  but a man who has seen his limits (echoing a quote from his Dirty Harry in THE ENFORCER  'A man's gotta know his limitations.') yet recognizes that his life does have meaning (even if it is in Gaelic, the one running joke of the film has Dunn reading it over and over and gives the final scene it's closure in his affected nickname for Maggie's fighting moniker from the ancient language).

One of the true genuine surprises of the year and arguably one of Eastwood's finest films ever. A knockout.",
22 August 2014,Good,"It's never boring. Eastwood is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. Here he has chosen to make a heart-felt, character-driven film. All of the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people.

8 May 2005,Is professional boxing a real sport?,"Since long time I am convinced of the need to prohibit men professional boxing, so for women it is much more obvious, and this film probably reflects much of our concern about this ""sport"" managed and ruled often by gangs. I still remember the Tyson-Hollyfield match, where Tyson finished biting Hollyfield's ear, ridiculous and anti sport behavior, but Tyson after sometime started to box again. Professional boxing destroyed several valuable boxers, among them Joe Louis, Kid Gavilan and others. Often you have an invented champion like Benny Parets in the 50s, who at the end was killed in the ring in a match with Emile Griffith. Parets was never a real champion, he was just the bait for a big match with Griffith, who was much better than Parets. Here the film goes around a girl of a very humble origin, with a family nearly illiterate and a bit wild. She wanted to help their relatives working and boxing, but her family wanted all money earned by her without giving any service to her at all. She (Hilary Swank) was persistent in her intentions to become a boxer, and was good under the advice of his trainer (Clint Eastwood), and got nearly all victories in the ring except one. The film plot is interesting in general, but I am asking myself: what happened to that wild woman boxer who did not follow the rules of the fight? The film never said nothing about her final fate, probably she continued behaving herself as she was. In boxing the spectacle is much more important than the human's life, the rules are made to see bloodshed, people falling down after several punches and agonizing. There is no protection to the man, at the end if he/she dies, who cares? These constraints are well shown by the film, which could have gone deeper into this problem, but probably Eastwood preferred to show some insides of this ""game"". It is not the first film about the problem of professional boxing, but it's the first one including women. Good acting of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, in fact both really were well awarded by their acting, Eastwood was also good but a little bit under the level of Swank and Freeman.",8
28 February 2005,"Million Dollar Baby, so well crafted its perfect","This movie is not an action packed boxing movie, its not some random character drama. This movie is all of that and (no pun intended) a million times more. This film, directed by Clint Eastwood, is one of the best films I have seen in my life. It isn't original but this movie does such an amazing job of drawing you into the scenes and the characters and the fights that you will be cheering and crying throughout this journey. The best part is what you take away from this film, a mild sort of hope and despair. This movie blends it all so well that you get involved in the film and love every moment. The acting is some of the best of recent years and Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all give powerful performances that are just involving. You really get to know these characters as the film progresses and the story opens up. I don't think there was any film last year that came even close to the level of perfection for this movie. Everything done by this movie was just on the dot perfect, and this is possibly the greatest film of Clint Eastwoods entire career.

2 June 2008,This film deserves every good thing said about it,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

16 August 2005,Cannot Leave You Untouched,"I really consider Clint Eastwood as one of the most charismatic persons of the film industry. While starting up with macho roles in movies like ""Dirty Hurry"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", he completely changed course later on and started doing very sophisticated, and even art, films, such as ""Mystic River"" and ""Bird"".

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a prime example of Clint Eastwood's genius. The story is about Maggie (Swank), a female boxer, who has nothing else in her life than her boxing talent. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a tired, old coach, whom she approaches and he grudgingly decides to take her after Eddie ""Scrup-Iron"" (Freeman), his assistant and pal, persuades him to. The girl proves to be a very promising athlete, and she climbs the ladder of success very swiftly. Frankie starts to feel very close with her, as she reminds him of his long-gone daughter. Things however get very nasty when Maggie suffers from a serious accident, and everything now gets turned upside down...

All the Oscars in this film (nominations and winnings), are well deserved: Eastwood provides us with an A-class direction, as he portrays us a dark world of losers where boxing is their only way for them to feel they have a purpose in life. The leading trio (Eastwood, Swank, Freeman) are so superb in their roles, that it is almost impossible for me to distinguish among them. All in all, the film describes a sad story, very well told, which cannot leave you untouched.",10

21 January 2005,Eastwood has made another great and touching movie,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxer, trainer, and sometimes manager who owns a boxing gym. Frankie has trained and managed a boxer for the last 8 years to a title fight, but he says he needs some more work, before he goes for the title. Frankie has been overprotecting his fighter, because he had a problem with another title fight many years earlier. The fighter drops Frankie and gets another manager. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) an untrained 31-year old fighter wants Frankie to train her, but Frankie tells her that she is too old and he doesn't train girls. Maggie begins to train on her own. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), an old boxer who lives in and looks after Frankie's gym, gives Maggie some tips on hitting the bag. Frankie wants Maggie out of his gym until he finds out that she has paid 6-months of gym dues in advance. Maggie trains day after day and finally gets under Frankie's skin. Frankie agrees to train Maggie, but she must follow his number-one rule, protect yourself at all times. Maggie begins to win fight after fight, and after 1-½ years, Maggie gets a title fight in Las Vegas for a share of a million dollar purse. Clint Eastwood not only stared in this movie, but also directed, produced, and wrote the music. The movie shows the determination a woman must have to fight her way into the male dominated world of professional boxing. Hillary Swank will surely be nominated for an Academy Award. The movie also shows the friendship and sense of family that is formed between a trainer and his fighter. You may shed a few tears at the end of the movie. (Warner Brothers, Run time 2:17, Rated PG-13) (10/10)",10

27 February 2005,One of the most moving films I've ever seen.,"I am writing this review on the afternoon of February 27th, a couple hours before the Academy Awards begin, and I really think that the Best Picture category is going to be mostly a contest between The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby, both of which are spectacular films, as are the rest of the nominees (Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways, in my order of preference). I caught this movie about a week ago at a theater a block from my house. The one thing that I really like about living in LA is that, especially at Oscar time, just about any movie nominated in any category is bound to still be playing somewhere, regardless of how long ago it was released.

Except Best Animated Short Film, of course. I still think those never play anywhere.

I have a feeling that Mystic River was passed over for the Best Picture award because of too much similarity to Clint Eastwood's outstanding 1999 film True Crime, and I had anticipated something in that general vein with Million Dollar Baby, if only because the appearance of the film is so similar. Eastwood has gone from making westerns to making one exceedingly dark film after another, and in this film he has succeeded like he never has in his storied career.

Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the owner of a pretty run-down boxing gym where hopefuls come to work out and get some training from him. It's the kind of gym from which you don't really expect to see many people rise to boxing stardom, so Frankie concentrates hard on one man that he's training, who has a chance at a title bout. It is during this time that Maggie (Hillary Swank) walks into the gym and starts calling him Boss, which he does not appreciate because, as he flatly tells her, ""I don't train girls.""

Up to this point in the film the plot has not really revealed itself. We know we are watching a movie about boxing that's not really about boxing (a sports movie cliché that Million Dollar Baby brilliantly sidesteps) and that Maggie is more than likely going to turn into the brilliant boxer that Frankie has been looking for. But beyond that the movie could go in a hundred different directions, and it promptly goes exactly where you didn't think it was going to go.

This could very easily have become a quickly forgettable sports film that disappeared into video store obscurity like even the good sports films like Miracle and Mystery, Alaska seem to have done, but by the end of the movie it has gone in such an original direction and given the audience such an emotional workout that, on my way out of the theater I saw people leaning against the handrail. This movie is so powerful that you have to rest after you see it.

Frankly, given how violent some of these sports movies are, especially ones like this, it amazes me that no other ones have gone as far as Million Dollar Baby does. The boxing scenes are thrilling to watch, even providing good comic relief as Maggie consistently knocks girls out in the first round and then looks sheepishly over at Frankie in her corner, who has instructed her not to knock them out so fast because it's getting so no one wants to put their boxer in the ring with her. He ends up having to bribe managers.

The conflict comes from the fact that Maggie is desperate for a title fight. She has come from a trailer in middle America where she worked as a waitress for something like 17 years, and she knew that she would never do anything else until she got herself out of there on her own. Her family certainly was not going to help. My God man, I could not believe those people. She was uneducated and unskilled, she didn't even know how to box but she had the determination and the motivation to learn, and learn she certainly did.

The problem is that one of Frankie's past trainees who managed to get a title fight was Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played in the movie by Morgan Freeman), who not only lost the fight but also was knocked blind in one eye. By the end of the movie, by the way, I like to think that Eddie may have considered changing his nickname to Eddie ""110"" Dupris. Frankie blames himself and he doesn't want to have another fighter injured. An honorable feeling, but it clashes with Maggie's goals, for whom not getting a chance to a title fight means she'll have to go back to being a waitress, which to her is nothing more than waiting to die. The interaction between the three characters is some of the best I've seen in years. And I've seen a lot of movies in years.

I am reminded of Friday Night Lights, which came out in late 2004 and was hailed as the best sports movie ever made, a bold statement that inspired me to eventually watch it. Fairly entertaining movie, but the ludicrous statement that it's the greatest sports movie ever made becomes even more ludicrous if you consider Million Dollar Baby to be a sports movie. This is one of the great films in all of film history. Do NOT miss it.

And with that, it's almost 4 o'clock. I'm going to go up to Hollywood Blvd. and see if I can catch a glimpse of Clint Eastwood.",10
26 August 2021,This is one of those films that's worth much more than a million dollars. How does it hold up today?,"""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), this is one of those movies that epitomize the meaning of unpredictable. On top of that, it has found a spot on my top ten all-time saddest films list. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a woman named Maggie is an amateur boxer who seeks the help of a reluctant trainer in the hopes of becoming a professional. It's about a simple as you can get, but for a story like this, it's warranted, as it allows for more character development. For the first half of the movie, it's kind of like a female version of ""Rocky"". Which, it kind of is, in a way. Then, there's a sudden twist that you will not see coming when you watch it. I certainly didn't expect it when it happened! That, of course made it all the more heartbreaking. I won't go into any further details about the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who may not have seen it yet. But, let me warn you, that I suggest you have a box of tissues next to you for the second half of the movie and especially for the ending. That being said, I didn't cry when I first saw it. However, I suddenly felt my eyes water a little bit. That's saying quite a lot, especially from someone like me! If a film can make me almost cry, then it more than succeeded with it's execution. All of the acting is impeccable from the whole entire cast, they knock it out of the park! But, the best performances come from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. They do a sublime job with their respectable characters! The best acting though in this movie is from Hilary Swank, as Maggie. In my opinion, I think it's her greatest acting performance out of all the films she's starred in. Hilary Swank is a great actress, and this movie laments that a thousand-fold! Her acting, as well as the others in the main cast, makes you genuinely care about their characters and want them to succeed at the end. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the film a stunning atmosphere. The lighting, in particular is very good. It highlights the emotions to full extent in the more serious scenes and accentuates how each character is feeling. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is a masterpiece and sets the perfect tone for the storyline. Aside from being the director, Clint Eastwood also wrote and composed the film score for this movie! How about that? Talk about full control! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece. It's one of those films that will leave you speechless when you watch it for the first time, or however many times you see it. Even though I know what's going to happen, every plot twist and moment is still a shock and the ending still moves me. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", what are you waiting for? Go see it today! But, like I said, make sure that you have some tissues with you when you see it. I personally guarantee that it will most likely make you cry!",10
13 April 2008,watch it..... then watch it again,"We have all seen the Rocky films, and we have all seen Raging Bull. Million Dollar Baby, directed by Clint Eastwood, deserves to sit alongside these terrific boxing films. Great cast, great story, and great direction from Eastwood.

When I first sat down to watch this movie I thought that it was just going to be very similar to Rocky, with a girl making her way to the top. But its so much more than that. The film is a powerful and moving experience to sit through.

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), is an experienced and successful Boxing trainer who runs a training gym with long time friend 'Scrap' (Morgan Freeman). Although Frankie appears to be a tough strict, man, he is secretly hiding a heartbreak involving his daughter, who he has made a lot of failed attempts to get in contact with her over the years. Oh yeah, and he 'doesn't train girls'. His work and lack of faith are the two main elements of his life, until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) walks into his gym.

Admiring Maggies work rate and attitude, Frankie eventually takes Maggie under his wing, beginning a relationship that see's Frankie develop her into a terrific boxer. The pairs relationship grows and it becomes clear that Frankie may have found the long lost daughter he's been looking for. The two are all each other have, and one horrific incident results in them facing a battle tougher than what they could ever face in a boxing ring.

I couldn't take my eyes off this movie and I was very moved by the performances. Easily a film you will watch again and again.",8
16 January 2005,"Pure, unbridled excellence","I'll cut to the chase -- this movie is flawless.

The direction, cinematography, and writing are all significantly better than ""Mystic River,"" with all three leads (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) turning in Oscar-worthy performances. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an intimate triumph, and could legitimately be called an ""instant classic."" The specifics of the story are available everywhere, so I'll spare those details. Less often discussed is the skill with which Eastwood treads the razor-thin border between ""been there, done that"" and perfection.

A look at this film's basic premise might make it appear rife with potential cliché, and the finished product may have lived down to that expectation in the hands of a less insightful director. Watching Eastwood evade the unintentional humor of Hollywood's traditional ""underdog-made-good"" stories (and soaking up the leads' brilliant performances) comprises much of the appeal of the film's first two acts.

The third act is simply arresting. The acting is one hundred percent flawless throughout the film's last thirty minutes. The pacing remains perfect. To a man, the sold-out audience of which I was a member was utterly, silently transfixed after the beginning of the film's third stanza.

As soon as you possibly can, see this movie. There is good reason for the unilaterally glowing reviews it has received from the ""big"" critics: ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece.",10
21 January 2005,Wow!,"I give this 9 stars out of 10.

I usually do not give most movies anything above 7 because they just do not deserve it. Movies that are 8, 9, 10 have two things in common: great story and great performance. Every year, only a handful of movies, if at that, I believe deserve a score of 8 or above. The reason why I am discussing this is because I have friends who will be receiving their Academy ballots for the upcoming Oscar Awards and I hope some of them will give their vote to this movie.

This movie is simply superb! Well written and very good performance. I cannot single out one person as standing out over others in this movie. Perhaps it is because you have three really good actors and actress who perform their craft so well that it seems effortless when you see them on the screen.

The story! I mean, when I first heard the premise of this movie, I was simply turned off by it and did not watch it when it first came out in theaters. Big mistake. The saying, you cannot judge a book by its cover, is so true here.

The movie is about a young woman (Hilary Swank) from a poverty background whose dream is to become a female boxer. She wants to train under a veteran trainer (Clint Eastwood) but he does not want to train her at first. The boxing gym's janitor (Morgan Freeman) gives her boxing advice so that she can train properly. Eventually, her perseverance wins out and the veteran trainer takes her under his tutelage. Things go well until tragedy strikes which causes the characters to evaluate what is truly important in their life.

If this was simply a boxing story, I would give it no more than 6 stars. Thankfully it is not. Kudos to Rope Burns, F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis, in bringing this story into creation. Further Kudos for director Clint Eastwood...the man is simply a juggernaut of talent.

Seeing movies like this really makes all those other bad movies that I had watched throughout the year, bearable.",9
10 February 2005,Phenomenal... The best film of the year!,"So I decided to go see Million Dollar baby on a whim after it was nominated for best picture and boy was I disappointed with myself. For not rushing out to see this astonishing motion picture. Clint Eastwood becomes a master of film with the story of a struggling woman coming out of her youthful prime whom is dying to be trained by him for women's boxing. He's a scruffy old fashioned guy who doesn't believe in training girls and cares to much about his fighters to watch them get hurt, sometimes blocking them from excelling. She is basically defined by herself to be white trash she works very hard as a waitress by day and eats peoples scraps off their plates to survive. She saves all her excess money to train at the gym and for equipment. In some of the film's saddest and most powerful scenes she confronts her trashy family and they have not a thread of redemability. Hilary Swank remains in her finest hour here even after her amazing performance in Boys Don't Cry if she doesn't get an Oscar for this it would be crime. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director and a star he directs the film with passion and acts with conviction. the film covers extremely dark territory and still manages to find some light in it. never before has a film based on any sport including Rocky hit such emotionally depressing depths. That are as memorable as they are powerful, littered with the years finest moments and talent Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal it leads the pack for the bets film of the year! 10/10",10
4 April 2012,Great movie!,"I basically agree with Ebert's and Berardinelli's reviews here. This was a very well made film about life, populated with real, flesh and blood characters. Apart from a regular, well developed 'boxing plot', the movie also poses a very difficult question about euthanasia, especially considering that this is a major US release. Eastwood answers it bravely and in a manner that will not be seen everywhere as being politically correct.

Oscar level performances by all three main characters, but especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman (so the Academy and I finally agree, for once). The camera was also very good. One of the all time great movies! Well done Clint!

3 February 2005,Certainly not the best movie of the year,"The middle hour of this movie was well-paced, well-acted and well-executed. Too bad the first and last half hours failed. Ten minutes into the movie, and I was already checking my watch. I almost walked out, but the story got interesting once ""Clint"" took ""Hilary"" under his boxing glove. The second act (one hour) then became pretty riveting: exciting boxing scenes, good drama between the two leads, back story development, yes! But then - like a loud, farting uncle who has worn out his welcome - came the melodrama in big heaping, dripping spoonfuls. I rolled my eyes more than once during this TV-movie-of-the-week portion of the movie.

The movie also boasts one of the most annoying secondary characters since Jar Jar Binks stunk up the screen. You'll know him within the first five minutes. Danger, film goers.

16 August 2005,"Move over Rocky, Maggie is in town!!","This was a great movie. I loved the way Clint and Morgan bickered all the time. Of course, nobody can narrate as good as MORGAN FREEMAN!! he is the master of it. Clint delivers more than the goods as the coach of the female Hillary Swank!! Hillary was actually really cute in this flick and kept calling Clint Eastwood BOSS. I was afraid that at one point, she was going to punch somebody out of the ring. If she had DONE THAT, then whoa!!! I loved that dude DALLAS who was retarded. He was innocent and although he called Morgan the N word, Morgan kept being nice to him. Oops, his name is Danger, not Dallas!! Look for a great cameo in the audience during the last fight from Blues Sarceno as a boxing fan. Also, look to get mad at the stupid fat mother!! I hate her so much. She is a fat cow.

5 April 2005,Boxing Ring of Life.,"Truly excellent film from director Clint Eastwood about a 30-something woman (a striking turn by Hilary Swank) from Missouri who dreams of becoming a boxer. She finally makes it out to California, meets trainer Eastwood (who wants nothing to do with her), and tries to convince him to help her with her sports career. Swank hangs around the gym, to Eastwood's dismay, and gets help from an old former fighter (Morgan Freeman in his finest performance) who now stays around and acts as a janitor at Eastwood's sweat-box. Reluctantly, Eastwood starts to help Swank and slowly they develop a father-daughter bond as Swank indeed starts a meteoric rise in the female boxing ranks. However, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not really about women boxers. It is a tale about three characters that are all broken up inside emotionally and all are trying to cling to something that can repair their damaged psyches. Swank, admitted white trash, feels like someone when she is fighting. The 15 minutes of fame she gets from it is something that makes her feel adequate and complete as a person. Eastwood is a devout Catholic that just does not understand God's ultimate plan. He tries hard to see that everything that happens does happen for a reason, but the fact that Freeman lost an eye while he was fighting under Eastwood's care still haunts him. This point makes Eastwood leery about putting his male boxers in the ring for championship bouts. And then there is Freeman (who also narrates here ala ""The Shawshank Redemption""), an individual that just seems tired and beaten by life in general. He has come to the realization (long before we ever see his character on film) that life is going to continue to punch him in the face and he has admitted defeat and put up a figurative white flag. His deep emotions are hidden by a worn-out body and a somewhat indifferent disposition. Landmark direction by Eastwood as he goes way beyond his best works behind the camera (""Unforgiven and ""Mystic River"") and arguably has his best performance in front of it. Freeman and Swank have jaw-dropping roles that make the whole thing work. This movie is not just about sports. It is a powerful motion picture about life, love, friendship, family, spirituality, mercy and the choices that define us as human beings. ""Million Dollar Baby"" raises huge questions about living that are not easily answered and many times not easily understood. An emotional knock-out that ranks real high on the list of greatest movies ever made. 5 stars out of 5.",
8 November 2006,"Sorry, it just didn't do it for me ...","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
29 January 2005,Fight movie with a wallop of a punch to the gut!,"Million Dollar Baby just came to our fair city this weekend, so I had to go see it. I'm leery of seeing a film when my expectations are so high, it's usually a letdown. Not in this case. I left the theater over an hour ago, and my eyes are still puffy and my nose is still stuffed and running. This is Clint Eastwood's best performance since playing Bill Munny in Unforgiven. In this movie he plays Frankie Dunn, a grizzled old fighter who now owns a boxing gym and trains young fighters. Morgan Freeman is perfect in the role of his sidekick, another old ex-fighter, taking care of the gym for Frankie, while Frankie takes care of him, for reasons that become known during the film. Same type of role he had in Unforgiven as Ned Logan. But the person who really shines in my opinion is Hilary Swank. This film is going to get her noticed. She was good in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and OK in ""Insomnia"", but in this she is simply terrific. She talks Frankie Dunn into managing and training her, against his better judgment, a decision that will have lasting consequences on his life.

Without giving too much away, one of the things that made this film so gut-wrenching for me was that it wasn't sentimental, and didn't fall into the trap of having to have a happy ending, rather the ending is about making choices and dealing with tragedy. We may all fantasize the happy ending,we fantasize because it so rarely happens; but if we live long enough, we all have to deal with choices and decisions in tragic situations.

Well, my nose is running again as I urge you to please go see this film, I think it will be worth your while.",10

20 August 2016,Incredibly moving - superb movie,"Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) owns and runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles, as well as managing some of the boxers there. Working for him is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). One day he is approached by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) who wants him to train her. He declines. Undeterred, Maggie joins his gym, hoping that he'll notice her and train. He is equally perseverant, knocking back all her requests to train her. However, eventually she wears him down and he trains her and manages her fight career. Her career goes very well and she now has a shot at the WBA title. Her opponent, the champion, does not play fair though...

Brilliant beyond description. Much much more than simply a boxing movie. It's a movie about friendship, looking out for one another and caring for those you love. Wonderful character depth and development and relationship development. Made by a twist nobody would see coming, and an ending that is emotional beyond compare.

Superb performance by Hillary Swank in the lead role, for which she won her second Oscar. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also great in their roles - Eastwood got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and Freeman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Freeman also provides the narration for the movie, and this is always a good thing.

The movie itself deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar in 2005 and Eastwood won Best Director.

This was to be Clint Eastwood's magnum opus and came in the middle of a purple patch for him. Before this he has made Mystic River and after was to come Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, Gran Torino and Invictus.",10
6 July 2020,Deeply depressing but beautifully acted.,"You may think that this is a generic sport movie, but it isn't, and not just because the ending is unforeseen; in technical matters I'd say that it's a masterpiece because everything it sets up has an incredible payoff meaningful to the plot, but in all honesty it's because you can sense the care that everyone put behind it

1 March 2014,Cringeworthy at times and brilliant at others,"Million Dollar Baby is a very inconstant film in quality terms. The start, I mean, the first twenty minutes of film are full of over the top situations (such as the conversation with the priest scene), silly inane dialogs, and a weird voice over by Morgan Freeman narrating everything that happened in the film, even when wasn't needed at all. Yes, horrible way to start a film. I felt that the actors were very uncomfortable saying certain lines because it was truly awful. Paul Haggis, no wonder. The guy who wrote and directed the arguably most moronic and inane(and undeserved) Oscar Winner Picture ever(Crash). Clint's direction was really really good, because the film was brilliant since the 30 minutes and this 'briliantism' lasted until the final 30 minutes. Was really good. The main problem with this film is the quantity of unrealistic situations. A hospital would never allow a patient's leg gangrene, for example. The priest was also completely put of the reality in the film. These among numerous other problems. I could enjoy a lot this film, which is technically very good too, I think Clint and Swank gave their best performances in their careers, but there is way too many awful parts that can't be forgiven. 7/ 10",7

5 April 2005,Captivating Story and amazing handling of characters and issues,"Plot Outline: Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) a veteran boxing trainer runs a dilapidated gym along with friend Scrap (Morgan Freeman), an ex-boxer who lost his eye fighting. Personally Frankie has suffered estrangement from his daughter, and feigns atheism but has been attending mass for the past 23 years.

Then Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a struggler requests Frankie to train her. Tired after years and with innate fear of seeing someone fatally injured, Frankie shrugs off Maggie. He tells her that she's too old and he doesn't train girls. But Maggie's determination makes Frankie agree, although grudgingly.The two come to discover a common bond that they share and loss of their families long ago.

Comment: The screenplay based upon stories from ""Rope Burns"" by FX Toole. The story packs two years of their lives into two hours showing the surrogate father-daughter relationship and personal/professional challenges they undergo.Direction and Acting are simply amazing (4 Oscars prove it). The characterization, plot and handling of touchy issues like euthanasia are neat. This is one movie that reiterates that Hollywood is the mecca for Movies and Superstars!

The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
24 October 2005,A real knockout!,"This movie is enjoyable even for those who are not crazy about sports movies. And aside from the fact that the Aviator, it's best picture nominee rival, is crap at best, there is a reason why this movie won the best picture award.

Clint Eastwood didn't just make a movie, he made a movie right! And is a blueprint on how to make a great movie. Unlike the Aviator that did everything wrong! Clint is, at worst, excellent in his characters reluctance to train a female boxer, and Hilary Swank is just as charming on her characters hardheadedness and determination. And the chemistry between these 2 actors are incredible when he finally decides to coach and train her, and is maintained all the way to the end. Excellent triumphs and tragedies throughout the movie.

Even some witty comebacks that can get you laughing.

In fact the only bad thing I can say about this movie is that you can't cook ham on the DVD.",10
13 February 2005,Well worth watching,"Million Dollar Baby is of the classical zero to hero format, but with a difference. Clint Eastwood's character is the typical ageing hero that we came to know in Unforgiven. Morgan Freeman's is also similar, the voice of reason and the only one old enough and experienced enough to make an impact.

All credit to Clint Eastwood and his evident clout in the business to be allowed to pull of a movie that did not have your typical happy Hollywood ending that has ruined so many otherwise excellent movies.

As a result, watching this movie is time well spent. The movie lingers on in my thoughts and it's not easy to forget the dilemma posed.

More impressive however, is the real life achievements of Lucia Rijker. It's a pity that with all that behind her, she had to settle for playing the bad guy.",10
20 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald.

22 February 2005,Hilary Swank knocks me out !!!,"This film is one of those that when you leave the cinema you still think about it, and you say to yourself, what a wonderful film I have just seen! I have to say, that when I bought the ticket, I was not so sure, a boxing film..mummy, I don't know.....but this is a boxing film that you should see and you'll be glad to see it. Yes, it's about boxing, but it's about life, love, a thrilling and heartbreaking movie. And Hilary Swank is outstanding, what an actress!! It's more than evident that she put her heart and soul into this demanding piece of work. I think she will have her second Oscar at home soon. Clint Eastwood is good too in his manager role, and the brilliant Morgan Freeman deserves the Oscar too. What more I could say, it's one of the best movies of 2004....go, see it and enjoy the show!!!!

23 September 2008,Warm,"Clint Eastwood is a man with , as we call it in the Netherlands) , a 'small' heart.A heart that's easely touched and moved by the force & drive of humanity. He succeeds in giving us people a feeling towards each-other.Hillary Swank succeeds 100% under Clints direction , in presenting us a incredibly believable character.She is a Huge actress.Her impersonation of Maggie and her Fight for Life in the broadest sense of the word , moved me deeply. all acting was great and convincing.The Story/script....Yes....., sentimantal at times , but never unreal or conceited. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was'nt packed with boxing scenes..(not my cuppa..so to say...) but with 'human interaction'...that was the message in this beautiful and touching story of a lovable Darling with Power , who found her truthfully supporter.until the end. A Moving Classic !!!

22 February 2005,Triumph of The Human Spirit !! 9.5,"Clint Eastwood directs and stars in another movie destined for classic status!!! Taken from the stories of ""Rope Burns""by F. X. OToole, Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman find the triangle is completed by the square of the boxing arena. The complexities of life merge with challenges of the sweet science for Maggie Fitzgerald(Swank) going nowhere in life, whose only release can be found in pugilism. A 31 year old unskilled amateur , Maggie in need of a trainer and manager, pursues Eastwood, who can provide the needed direction. Eastwood finds Maggie, as the lost daughter and champion fighter , that can salvage his life. Scrap-Iron(Morgan Freeman) exorcises his demons, with his symbiotic relationship with Eastwood and Swank.

The movie moves along at an even pace, with plenty of emotional highs ,and some lows. Terrific performances by Swank, Eastwood and Freeman , are more than worth the price of admission. Not a true boxing movie, but about life choices, or lack of them, and the sacrifice people are willing to take to achieve them. Terrific direction by Eastwood, takes you to the core of the principle characters, and has you rooting for every punch thrown, a victory for all of us.

A must see for everyone who has to make that moment of truth decision !

A Triumph of the human spirit ,that you will never forget !!!",

16 May 2020,Million dollar baby,"It's hard to imagine that Clint Eastwood produced, directed, starred in, and even scored the film. It's even harder to imagine that the man was nearly seventy years old at the time. People of this age, in our concept, should have retired to the land, retired to the world, and this old genius is under high pressure, high intensity, painstaking, presented to us a so-called ""repression to the extreme"" film. I can't even express my admiration and admiration enough. There are no pretty faces, no fantastic special effects, no fantastic music, and even a handful of characters. But no one can deny its timeliness and unrepeatability.

12 March 2006,Heartwrenchingly powerful...it's a movie that nearly anyone can relate to and enjoy,"'Million Dollar Baby' was the first Oscar winning screenplay written by Paul Haggis (Crash). Directed by film legend Clint Eastwood, MDB is nearly perfect in every aspect of film making. When you see this, the acting of Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and especially Hilary Swank will leave you moved. Deserving of all the accolades it received, MDB is not only the best picture of 2004, but one of the best in history.

Frankie (Eastwood) is a very hardworking and talented boxing trainer, getting the most out of his fighters, even if their talent isn't Ali or Louis caliber. His most talented fighter has just left him (you see this in the movie) for more money, but is very sad he has to do so, and thanks Frankie by saying that he taught him all he would ever need to know. Then, one day, Frankie and his custodian (Freeman, who lives in the boxing gym) notice a young woman (Swank), Maggie Fitzgerald, punching a bag like clockwork every day. Frankie is at first annoyed by the upstart lady, rapidly declining her request that he train her. Over time, when Maggie tells her story of poverty, financial struggle, and desire to become a champion to Frankie, he reluctantly agrees to train her until she finds a manager. After Frankie decides to fully train and manage her, we see Maggie's success skyrocket. What ensues are some pretty intense boxing scenes. Also what begins is a fantastically acted father-daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie.

We begin to see Maggie's success and popularity soar, and we get more insight into her life, especially her troubled past, consisting of a neglecting mother who we will grow to hate. Swank's performance as Maggie is so good that you will love Maggie so much for her determination to becoming a champion and her kick-ass approach in the ring. All the while, we get a preview of Maggie's ultimate opponent, a ruthless and dirty fighter, a fight which will scare the squeamish. It is hard to go on further without spoiling the plot, which I will not do.

The best acting of the movie comes after Maggie's big fight, and it is the reason the movie won so many awards. Eastwood's portrayal of Frankie's inner-struggle in life because of boxing over the years is just great. If not for Jamie Foxx's brilliant portrayal of Ray Charles, Eastwood would've won the Best Actor Oscar last year. Hilary Swank delivers one of the best performances in history as the chipper and lovable Maggie, and Morgan Freeman, while I have not mentioned him too much in this review, is once again great as usual. He is Frankie's right hand man, adviser, and best friend. What you'll notice is that each character will have a scene that defines their performance. Eastwood's is the last scene of the movie, Freeman's is in the middle-end of the movie when he is cleaning something, and Swank's is virtually every scene she is in. That's how good she is.

As I said before, it's really hard to review this movie without giving away plot details, and while I'm doing a horrible job of hiding that fact, Eastwood's direction and Haggis's writing do an excellent job of making the movie's most important events come out of nowhere to get to you. In most movies, you feel like you're just watching a fictitious adventure that's pretty cool. This is not the case. You'll feel as if you are getting a look into Frankie and Maggie's lives, and that is the mark of a job well done. You'll get the same feeling when watching 'Crash', which I've also reviewed. I'll admit, I watched this movie at my school's auditorium a few weeks ago because they showed it to kids who were excused from testing, but I decided to watch carefully and I'm glad I did. There's one other fact that made this movie so good: Never before had I seen something or someone that could silence 300 teenagers, but this movie did.

3 March 2020,This Best Picture winner left me stunned.,"I just finished this movie and I am stunned. Million Dollar Baby must have the saddest ending in a movie that I have ever experienced. This is kind of ironic, considering the rest of the movie made me feel so good and excited.

The movie may remind you of Rocky, which won Best Picture as well, 28 years prior. While I do agree that this was the best of the nominees(though I have not seen Finding Neverland), I personally love The Passion of the Christ and Spider Man 2(by one spot) a bit more.

This stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, a poor waitress who struggles so much that she has to take hardly eaten steak home to eat for dinner.

She asks Frankie, a trainer played by producer-director-composer Clint Eastwood, to train her. He refuses at first since she's a girl, but with the help of his friend, played by Morgan Freeman, he agrees.

She gets good, but tragedy strikes, and Frankie, who grows to like her, has to make a very difficult choice.

I have already mentioned my emotions while watching this movie. That pretty much summarizes what makes this movie so great. It put me through a ton of emotions, and the story was so well told.

The ending made me tear up and cry a little, and few movies make me do this. Million Dollar Baby has the saddest ending since The Green Mile, assuming few sadder movies were made in the next 5 years.

(Besides The Passion of the Christ, which came out earlier that year-though that makes me tear up throughout, so that doesn't count in this scenario.)

As I watched the movie, I thought that this must be a true story-it seemed very realistic, and the kind of true story that would be adapted to film. But as I looked at the special features, I found out that it was fictional. Isn't amazing how great of a story humanity can tell to others?

If I had to have one gripe about the movie, it would have to be something that may not apply to you. I have partial hearing loss, and it was hard to hear the actors most of the time, so I watched the movies with subtitles. Though that's a minor complaint.

These aspects now makes this one of the best movies I have ever seen! Million Dollar Baby is a priceless masterpiece.

4 quick cool movie facts I want to share:

1. This was the first Best Picture winner to be released on HD DVD and Blu-ray.

2.It was in theaters for 6.5 months.

3.Roger Ebert also called this the best movie of the year.

4. This is the 2nd Clint Eastwood movie to win Best Picture-the other is Unforgiven from 1992. Morgan Freeman stars in this, as well.",10
19 May 2008,No female rocky!,"Truly, one of the best films of the year of 2004 and one of Eastwood's best! I had an impression this would be just a female rocky, but I assure you, it is not. Hilary Swank won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance and Eastwood got well earned Oscars for director and picture. The acting, especially Hilary Swank is superb, including Freeman, who is in supporting this time (who also won). The music was haunting but great, there's offbeat humor, and some of the most important lessons everyone should learn. The only probably with this movie was the last thirty minutes of the film. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it seems to drag on and on. My overall rating: 9 out of 10.

16 February 2005,Clint Eastwood is a national treasure,"At first glance, ""Million Dollar Baby"" seems like it should be pedestrian fare. An aging boxing trainer and his old sidekick take in a poor white girl who dreams of becoming a champ and, together, they work to get to the top. It's the sort of pulpy stuff the likes of Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford might have reveled in.

So why does ""Million Dollar Baby"" work? One reason: Clint Eastwood.

At 75, Eastwood might very well be the best American filmmaker working today. A true auteur, it's evident of his amazing talent that he's taken a generally conventional story and turned it into a rich, deep, insightful character study.

As for conservatives enraged by the film: Get real. They're all for promoting free thought and expression so long as it doesn't differ from what they believe, their worldview. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a movie. What the characters do, the decisions they make fit with what makes the story work.

There's no great conspiracy or agenda at work. It's good storytelling and conservative hosts should worry more about having an administration that fabricates evidence and seems quite keen on stifling due process and expression in the name of security. Now, that's a frightening agenda.

What propels ""Million Dollar Baby"" are three spectacular performances. Hilary Swank, as the young wannabe champ Maggie Fitzgerald, proves beyond any doubt that her Best Actress Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) was no fluke. She imbues Maggie with grit, determination and courage; and when the story requires her to change focus, she makes Maggie vulnerable without ever making her weak. After watching Swank in this film, you'll understand why she's winning all the awards for her performance.

Eastwood as the trainer Frankie Dunn and Morgan Freeman as his assistant Eddie Dupris rarely have been better. Not only is he a great filmmaker, Eastwood's also turned into a fine actor. Frankie, like many of Eastwood characters, is a man of few words. He struggles with his own dilemmas and remains emotionally distant. Yet, there's real depth of feeling in Eastwood's portrayal. He conveys more genuine emotion with his craggy, weathered face than most actors can with superb dialogue and Actor's Studio training.

Watching Eastwood and Freeman work together is a treat. There's tremendous chemistry between them. They play off each other with supreme ease like an old couple very familiar with each other's idiosyncrasies. They're good friends, old pros whose riffs go down smoothly like a glass of great scotch.

Despite directing many films, Eastwood always was known primarily as an actor. But in the last several years, he has emerged as one of America's great filmmakers with work such as ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Mystic River"" (2003). Heck, Eastwood even turned that horrible novel, ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" into a good film in 1995.

True, ""Million Dollar Baby"" works with numerous cinematic clichés. But Eastwood still creates visual poetry, from his choice of camera angles to eliciting tender, effective and moving performances, from his superb use of his own musical score to creating the perfect mood.

The film's flaw perhaps is the over-use of Freeman's voice-over narration. Telling an audience what to think, how to feel, the real emotion of a particular moment are something the actors must convey through their performances; Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis shouldn't have to rely on narration. Narration is an easy way for screenwriters to cheat and, more often than not, I got the feeling that's exactly what Haggis was doing.

Freeman's voice isn't the issue here. That's amazing. But, at times, his narration is obtrusive. The reason for the narration's made clear at the end, but I wish Eastwood had limited its use, that he'd used it as cleverly as he did his music.

Nevertheless, ""Million Dollar Baby"" remains touching, funny, poignant, powerful. It's a superbly acted film made by a master craftsman.",7
30 April 2013,Emotional Knock-Out ...,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is undoubtedly the most acclaimed movie of 2004. It has often been referred by movie critics as a cinematic come-back to a more traditional film-making, like the dark and gripping Hollywood underdog stories of the 30's and 40's, a comparison that has been made for ""Rocky"" in its time.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film of a few characters that yet constitute a solid and powerful acting ensemble. But has Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman ever gave a disappointing performance? Even Hillary Swank who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is totally diluted in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald, the white trash Southern girl whose only dream in life is to become a professional boxer. 'Dream' is too vague a word, 'reason to keep faith in this world' is more appropriate. And faith is a redundant theme in the story, faith as a strong belief in life's driving forces, including ours. It's definitely an underdog story, but told with great respect to the viewers.

Like its glorious 'underdog' predecessor, ""Rocky"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" restrains all the emotions until finally imploding during a poignant and heart-breaking third act. The first ones consist on building relationships until their reason-to-exist within the story emotionally bloom. Clint Eastwood is Frankie Dunn, the hardened boxing trainer and Morgan Freeman, his assistant Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, an ex-athlete whose dead eye symbolize other unconcealed wounds in his heart. Frankie also has demons to exorcise, and the film never tries to hide them. We understand it's about a daughter life has taken away from him, that he tries to find some meaning about God, harassing a priest with pointless questions ... that would take all their significance at the end.

It's also easy to see that Maggie would complete Frankie, that he's going to help her as much as she will. It takes time before he takes the crucial decision to train her, maybe too much time but this is the mark of a film that cares more about characters than action. It's true sometimes, we can feel some events coming, when Frankie seems reluctant to engage his most valued protégé in Heavyweight championship; we know it's a matter of time before the man leaves him. Why? Because there has to be a gap in Frankie's heart, and relationships are all about ""filling gaps"". That's what Balboa said about his romance with Adrian, the same goes between Frankie and Maggie, in a father-and-daughter way. There is a mystery surrounding the Gaelic nickname he'll gave to her, the translation, if not surprising, is nonetheless poignant.

That's the point, if you expect surprises, if you expect twists and new artistic licenses on the Sports genre, get ready for disappointment. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has the one flaw of Clint Eastwood's film: things are obvious and straight-forward, the bad guys are bad, the good ones are good. The way Maggie is treated by her opportunistic Welfare-cheating family, almost as villainous as the Big Blue Bear, is Eastwood's trademark, the depiction of a world in black and white. The film itself has a dark and shadowy atmosphere, conveying the nastiness and cruelty of a world, where the most precious moments have to keep intimate and secret. Rather than an exercise in obviousness, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that focuses on these intimate interactions, these moments where something sacred is transmitted: a secret, a declaration, a revelation 

And only Eastwood and Freeman can get away with their own clichés without ruining the film's intents. Yes, we have Morgan Freeman and his noble voice-over narration, translating into words what sometimes images can't express. Yes his gravely, deliberately monotonous voice, has a hypnotizing effect in our ears. Yes, Eastwood is groaning, grumpy character. Yes, the comparison with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is inevitable, and it's impossible not to laugh sometimes at Eastwood's bad moods. But ""Million Dollar Baby"" has to be judged in its entirety, if you feel manipulated, ask yourself about the movie's pay-off, what does it speak to you? What does it say about life, about dreams? Sentimentality is one thing, but movie-making is an art-form whose merit can only be judged on its capacity to inspire emotions. And emotionally, the ending is satisfying.

I feel like I would spoil the film if I go further in this review. I don't want to reveal the events that constitute the final third act, although the film's ranking among one of the greatest tear-jerker give enough hints not to expect a happy ending. But again, it's not about happiness, but about people meeting each other, and filling each other's gaps. It flirts with some obviousness, but to be sincere, I never felt it forced or stereotypical. I wish I could be smart and cynical enough to dismiss the film, and label it as propaganda, manipulation and dangerous influence, but the fact is that the three performance touched my heart. I understand the criticism, I even understand the hatred, but the film deeply moved me.

The 'obviousness' is precisely what critics refer as renaissance of Hollywood tradition. Maybe in this era where psychological thrillers and non-linear narrative are overused by new talents, a movie like ""Million Dollar Baby"" that doesn't care about subtlety and nuance yet cares to tell a gripping and powerful story about three people, maybe this is the refreshment cinema asked for. And the fluid directing, the shadowy cinematography, the patient editing and the acting, contribute to a powerful movie, showing people evolving with time, people with dreams and hopes.

Reviewing a film is a matter of genuine feelings and sincerity; I would be lying to myself if I started to criticize it for the sake of it. If I did, no matter how clever and hip I would sound, I wouldn't dare to review other movies. In all sincerity, I loved ""Million Dollar Baby"" and it's indeed one of Clint Eastwood's best works.",9
16 August 2005,One of the best films in the past decade ... and the decade before that ...,"Forget your personal taste for a particular type of film. Forget about all the films you thought was great in the past few years. Clint Eastwood, at his age as a master director now, shows what the simplicity of storytelling can be without all the bells-and-whistles of today's films, filled with all sorts of boring twists and uninteresting characters.

Million Dollar Baby is the newest blueprint to simple, cinematic storytelling done at it's best.

Paul Haggis' script should be the newest example of ""How to write great stories for the big screen?"" It should be issued in film schools across the world, showing these wannabes how it is done. It should be used as a source of inspiration for studio execs looking for that next project that would help them keep their jobs. He told enough on the character's journeys without giving us too much information. He never tried to spoon feed us with the answers to all of our questions by explaining. I'm glad we never knew what exactly was the problem between Frankie (Clint Eastwood) and his daughter. Haggis forces the viewers to take as much as we needed to join in on this extraordinary journey. He had shown us how to use narration without using narration.

Clint Eastwood's directing was superb. He was able to capture crucial and emotional moments that didn't lessen the quality of the writing. He was able to help his cast deliver excellent performances depicting simple characters that seem to be ""the unwanted."" He also didn't take away from the cinematic experience with fancy camera angles and MTV style editing. He would have a master shot that can hold on a moment as long as possible, and with the help of the great performances, the beautifully choreographed masters work without boring us. He didn't drown out the moments with predictable, cliché music scoring as well, contributing to the beautiful music that expressed the power of this simple story without feeling out of place.

Hillary Swank's best performance ever. I enjoyed her more in this movie than the last film she had done that won her her first Oscar. She was empathetic without being sympathetic. She was real. Her ability to be tough and sometimes ruthless, merciless, was seen in her boxing matches with opponents. Maggie's love never felt false.

Morgan Freeman's well deserved Oscar performance. It's about time. He was subtle and realistic. He didn't try to provoke anything from anyone, especially the audience. Scrap was one of those characters that believed in the best in all of us and was humbled enough by his own life experiences to help us find that potential in ourselves, encouraging us to use it as a survival tool. He only added to this ensemble cast.

And, in my humble opinion, this is Clint Eastwood's best performance ever, which is hard to say looking back on his long career.

I don't want to give away too much of the film. I advise all filmmakers and audiences alike to go and experience the best film of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. This is what film story telling is all about. 10/10 - A+",10
19 July 2008,A metaphor of social life,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
27 July 2022,"""My darling ,My blood.""","Million Dollar Baby.

Maggie is following her dream of being a professional boxer and asking for the help of a veteran trainer called Frankie.

That's a classic that nobody should miss , the best picture winner Million Dollar Baby is a terrific drama with a good dose of sport .

I thought it would be just another classy sport movie , but it's way more than that and I can't say more.

Perfectly written screenplay offered a balanced and a well-paced plot , I was enjoying every moment of it , hearing Morgan Freeman's voice with the narrating ,you just can't find a smoothest one to do the job .

Before talking about Clint Eastwood's performance ,let's talk about his directing , a well deserved directing Oscar win back then , it wasn not the complicated kind of directing nor the impressive one, but it was beautifully simple and that exactly what this genre requires .

For acting performances , 3 worthy Oscar performance from each of Hilary swank , Morgan freeman and Clint Eastwood especially , unfortunately Eastwood haven't won it!

Seeing these three people for two hours was fun ,they all were funny and dramatically they were delivering , I loved the chemistry , I loved Hilary being a 31 years old boxer ,I loved Clint being a hardened boxing trainer and man! I loved Morgan with the Voice-over .

This is one of my new favorites in its genre , it motivates and it hits hard ,this film will last .

""Girlie ,tough ain't enough.""",9
30 January 2005,Powerful and Profound,"This is definitely one of the year's best and, in my opinion, much better than The Aviator. Although I thought Aviator was good, I nearly fell asleep. This one had me from the very beginning. Someone said they felt it was slow starting. I disagree. Every little thing that was said or seen contributed to the development of the characters and the story. Excellent cast, excellent acting and an even more excellent script. The story is moving and thought provoking (I was still emotional an hour after leaving the theater).

Clint Eastwood has done it again!! I sincerely hope the academy honors this film with ""Best Picture"" as I believe it truly deserves it!!

7 February 2005,One of the best films of 2004. A heavy weight Oscar contender,"Heres a review for one of the best films of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. Gathering up seven nominations in this years Academy Awards, its one of the best-reviewed movie, and this one will really be no different.

Million Dollar Baby is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank, a wanna-be boxer who has made it to her level by sheer determination and raw talent. Maggie seeks out the help of aging boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn, portrayed by director Clint Eastwood, who co-owns a boxing gym with retired boxer Eddie Dupris. Frankie, who has been burdened by his relationship with his estranged daughter, finds something remarkable in Maggie's determination, and is able to open up to a relationship with her. The film carries these characters through the pains and struggles of, not only boxing, but life as well to an astonishing and beautiful ending.

I have to admit that all the other reviewers have been right. This movie is one of the best of 2004. The performances are remarkable along with the direction. Hilary Swank is astonishing and not only deserved the nomination for best actress, but also deserves the trophy. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood both do a great job playing off of one each other as old boxing friends. The chemistry throughout the movie is spectacular. The script works on so many levels. The movie looks like a heavy drama, and is, but does not nerve away from adding some other great, heart-warming characters and some great lines.

Clint Eastwood, as one would expect, truly grasps this story and makes it come alive with his directing. He is definitely a big contender in the best directing category for the Oscars, and may even walk away with the statue. Eastwood is able to make this movie about the boxer, and the trainer instead of about boxing, as some other directors would have. It's a movie about the life behind boxing, and that's what makes the film great.

When reviewing a movie, a critic always looks for not only what was great about it, but also what hinders it. And I can honestly say that I cannot think of a single item. The only, for lack of a better word, problem I had with the film, is how much it looked like it reeked of ""gimme Oscars!"" However, it's less obvious in the actual film itself than in the trailer. And this ""fault"" is, by no means, a bad thing.

Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic use of celluloid, and after my many reservations about the movie, I must concede to the professional reviewers and give this movie five stars. Because it is that good. While Sideways is my top pick for best film, Million dollar baby is definitely, soul crushing pun alert, a vicious right hook knock out.",
22 October 2011,Good study from Eastwood,"Million Dollar Baby is arguably the most well-acted film of 2004 and the most compelling. It holds our attention almost all the way through with its passionate storytelling. Swank and Freeman are both entrancing in Oscar-winning efforts and Eastwood is no less enthralling as Swank's grizzled trainer. Eastwood does not focus on as much the boxing itself, but the nature of the characters that participate in the sport. The only flaw is the murky, strange ending that does not sum up the film in the way our emotions want. However, 95% of this is excellent movie-making that challenges the viewer to think, not just watch and listen.

13 April 2005,"Simple, yet deep","I went to see this movie only knowing it was about boxing and that it had won the Oscar for Best Picture for 2004. I was glad I knew nothing else as it made the experience all the better.

I very rarely give a film 10/10 - I've only done this 4 times, including this picture, in the last 20 years.

The story was simple but strong and very moving. Superb acting with credible characters. The 3 central characters all had depth and were total heart-breakers. Maggie's family were so toxic, it took my breath away.

Pure poetry in the script writing. It was an easy film to watch: not overdone or heavy going (like ""The Aviator""). It was wonderful to watch such a fantastic film without a typical Hollywood ending.

For me it has touched my heart and made me more strongly appreciate my family. Those Oscars were well deserved.

Thank you Clint, Hilary and Morgan. I will reflect on this movie for many years and I'm sure will watch it again and again.",10
12 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"I thought it was a great movie. If you have not seen it, You need to.I think that Hilary Swank did a great job, So did Morgan freeman. Did you know that this movie got 2 Grammy awards? That is why this movie is so good. I also liked the movie Girlfight,It was also a boxing movie.I think that Michelle Rodriguez did a great job in this movie too. Has any one seen this movie before? This movie is old. It was made in 2000. That makes it five years old.I think that Hilary,Morgan and Michelle has did more great movies.Has anyone seen the other movies that they have made? I think that most are good if not all of there movies are good.The movie million dollar baby is still in theaters,If there is somebody that has not seen it yet. Thanks,babygirl25

8 March 2005,One of Hollywood's Best Ever Films!,"Note: Actors names are used instead of their character's names in the film.

""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) Directed by: Clint Eastwood Starring:Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman

**** Excellent

""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) is that rare and daring film from Hollywood, when skilled direction, writing and acting come together in a surprisingly powerful manner. ""MDB"" is a small scale, low key, intimate film that packs honesty and raw, heart wrenching emotion.

Hillary Swank gives a powerful performance as a poor, single waitress from a rural background, who decides, against the odds, to become a boxer. Clint Eastwood portrays a former boxer, now trainer in his own gym. He reluctantly accepts Swank as her first trainer. Morgan Freeman portrays a retired boxer who almost won a title under Eastwood's training. He is now an assistant to Eastwood at the gym and is the one who notices Swank's determination and gives her a chance getting started with training at the gym. Both Eastwood and Freeman give strong performances to back up Swank's memorable acting performance.

Swank's character and transformation are convincing and believable, as she begins to find herself in life. Her toughness, stubbornness and determination help make her a winning boxer. From a troubled, broken family and a life of struggle, her new boxing career becomes a life renewed. During the several years of successful partnership as boxer and trainer, Eastwood gradually becomes a father figure to Swank.

Nothing, however, really prepares one for the sudden and unexpected change of events that occur about midway into the story and dramatically changes the mood of the film. By this time, we have strongly bonded emotionally with Swank's character, feeling empathy for her life situation and struggles. So this sudden shift in the story is all the more powerful and sets the stage for deeply intimate and heart wrenching emotions in the second half of the film, which ends in a surprising and poignant manner.

Unlike typical Hollywood films, ""MDB"" has honesty, sensitivity, believable, ordinary people and raw emotional power. ""MDB"" will leave you with lingering, heartfelt sorrow. An extraordinary film.",
30 July 2005,Worthy of its Oscars,"What can you say? Clint Eastwood is like a fine wine that just keeps getting better with age. ""Mystic River"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"", and ""Million Dollar Baby"" from a guy who made spaghetti westerns 40 years ago. Hilary Swank is an ""A"" list actress. This performance was on par with her portrayal in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Then, of course, there is Morgan Freeman. Well, actors just don't come any better than him. Too many great characters in so many outstanding films. ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Bruce Almighty"" and on and on....

So, what do you get when you take a great script, a quality actor/director, more quality actors and the big screen to showcase it all? You get one of the best films of the year and a film that will instantly be securely on the list of top films of all time.

A great motion picture does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft. Just like films such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" will be as much of a gem decades from now as it is today.",10

12 March 2009,"A ""million dollar"" waste of your time.","Clint Eastwood starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote the music for Million Dollar Baby. And the result is typical for actors who direct their movies as well. This is, to put it nicely, a terrible movie. Until the ending, the movie's message seems to be ""you can accomplish anything if you try hard"". And then comes the ending, which destroys any possibilities of a moral from this movie. Eastwood does nothing new, playing his standard, anti-hero, ""tough guy"" role. Morgan Freeman appears in this embarrassing movie, but miraculously, manages not to embarrass himself. This is a film overridden with clichés, absolutely boring and lifeless. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year. Must've been a bad year.

23 April 2005,Clint Eastwood scores another home run directing this heartbreaking story about a determined woman boxer.,"Starring: Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman Boxing is a sport that I personally do not appreciate. Two guys go into the squared circle, put on some gloves, and beat the living crap out of each other. To me, that isn't entertainment. That's just stupidity.

If nothing else though, I admire the people who go through that rigorous training and have the physical skill and strength to be such incredible fighters.

Million Dollar Baby is a movie all about boxing. Frankie (Eastwood) is an over the hill boxing trainer and manager who owns a gym. His prize fighter is on the verge of being ready for a title match, but Frankie holds him back for a few more fights so that he's ready. His fighter doesn't want to wait and finds a new manager.

From the beginning of the movie, there is a woman frequently showing up at the gym to train. Her name is Maggie (Swank), a southerner from a poor background with dreams and a truckload of ambition. She wants Frankie to be here manager, but Frankie doesn't train girls. No matter how hard Maggie tries to convince him, Frankie doesn't budge.

Eventually, after his fighter leaves him, Frankie has a change of heart and decided to take Maggie on. They form a friendship that almost seems like a father/daughter relationship. Frankie looks out for Maggie all the time, doing his best to protect her, guide her, train her, and send her forward into the boxing world. Maggie advances and eventually gets a title bout. But tragedy strikes. Specifically, I will not say what, but Maggie's boxing career comes to an abrupt and tragic end.

The rest of the movie is very difficult to watch because you feel genuinely sorry for Maggie when you see her lying in that hospital bed. At points in the movie I felt my eyes getting a little moist.

Million Dollar Baby is a very well done movie. The acting is superb, the plot is great, the movie is mostly clean. But the ending is far too tragic for my taste. I watch movies to be entertained. Not depressed.

This movie is very good in a The Green Mile or Forrest Gump kind of way.

Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)",9
7 December 2005,Best movie of 2004,"When Eastwood directed Unforgiven and took home the directing Oscar, many people, myself included, thought it would be his only moment of glory. Wrong. Predictably enough, those same people thought that after he directed Mystic River. Wrong again. Eastwood slams another one home with Million Dollar Baby, the movie that took home the gold for all those concerned with the picture. Hillary Swank's stock just keeps going up and up she should be listed on NASDAQ. Freeman is stunning as ever with his performance and narration and let's not forget Eastwood. Eastwood hasn't shown that wide a range of acting ever. For the first time in my life I felt truly connected to one of his characters. I have always liked his movies but he really runs the gambit here. It was tailor made just for him. I can't say enough good things about this picture.

3 October 2009,Prototype Of Subtlety,"Beautifully written, superbly directed and excellently acted in, Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' both captivates and involves the viewer in a staggering film experience. This is not the typical underdog's rags to riches story. The story here is driven by the characters Frankie and Maggie and narrated by Frankie's friend Scrap.

All three characters are ordinary people living, or rather, surviving in the real world. Of the older characters, Dunn is living a life of regret as he visits church almost every day writing letters to his daughter only to have them returned without being sent while Scrap, a retired boxer, is supervising a gym yet wishes if only he had completed 110 matches. Suddenly a young and stubborn but very passionate young woman, whose dream is to become a boxer, enters their lives and changes it forever. 'Million Dollar Baby' is about passion. What we get from this amazing movie is that all three characters lived for their passion and even though it did came with a price, it is better to have lived your life with passion, to make your dream come true even if it is only for a short while than to go through life wondering why and regretting having never done anything about it.

The film has been made, directed, written, filmed and performed in with heart. Eastwood has pretty much given his best and extracted the best from his cast and crew. He has done an incredible job with Haggis's solid screenplay. He just reminds us why he's one of the best in the business and what a remarkable career he's had. As Frankie Dunn he is simply awesome. Morgan Freeman is exceptional as Scrap-Iron Dupris. As for the admirable Hilary Swank, what can I say? This is easily one of the finest performances by an actress in a lead role and perhaps Swank's best to date. She has given Maggie Fitzgerald and Mo Cuishle her all and not only does the performance appear natural on screen but the her Maggie really creates a place in the viewer's heart as they cheer and empathize for her.

What also struck me about 'Million Dollar Baby' is the subtlety. Pretty much everything is underused and downplayed, whether it's ligthing, camera-work, art direction, humour, drama, presentation of themes and even music. The gentle soundtrack (also by Eastwood) contributes beautifully to the film. This is perhaps a prototype of subtle film-making. Lastly, 'Million Dollar Baby' is an all-round winner. It deserves to be watched and even after repeated viewing, its effect hasn't deteriorated.",
30 January 2005,Possibly Clint's Best....,"I went in to the theater today to see Million Dollar Baby with high expectations. After all the reviews have been great and the awards are starting to rack up for both the actors and the other people involved with this movie.

I was not disappointed. This is a great film, possibly Clint Eastwood's best work as an actor and director. Clint plays grizzled fight trainer Frankie Dunn, a ham and eggs kind of guy with a very gruff exterior. When we first meet Frankie he is carefully managing the career of a rising star boxer from the trainer's hardscrabble gym. Frankie seems to be bringing this fighter along too carefully, as there is a championship bout awaiting. Later in the film we learn the reasons Frankie is careful with his boxers.

Right at the beginning of the film we meet Maggie Fitzgerald, played brilliantly by Hilary Swank. Maggie is a very tough young woman in her early 30's. Some people might call her character ""white trash"" and they wouldn't be too far off of the mark. But that would only describe the superficial aspects of Maggie's character. You quickly come to appreciate Maggie's determination and grit as she hounds Frankie Dunn daily with the request to train and manage her. Frankie wants nothing to do with her initially but slowly is won over by Maggie's personality.

As all of this is going on we meet ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a washed up old boxer and possibly Frankie's only friend. Scrap-Iron helps Frankie run his gym and is won over by Maggie a lot quicker than Frankie is. Scrap-Iron is played by the always great Morgan Freeman. Freeman deserved his Best Supporting Actor award.

Frankie agrees to train and manage Maggie and this is when the film really takes off. Frankie is, for reasons never really explained in the movie, estranged from his own daughter. Maggie becomes Frank's surrogate daughter.

Maggie starts to rise in the ranks as a boxer. It turns out that she's exceptionally gifted as a boxer. Her relationship with Frankie grows with each fight. There are virtually father and daughter and are fulfilling that emotional role for each other.

The movie takes a dramatic turn which I won't reveal in this review. The events only deepen your appreciation for the emotional integrity of all of the main characters.

What can I say about the 3 main actors in this film that hasn't already been said? Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan I am immensely satisfied to see him finally getting the respect for both his acting and directing skills from his peers, the critics and the general public. I hope that Clint continues to make films. It's great to go to a movie that is about something, has characters you care about and a real story. Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. You never even get the impression that this great actress is acting. She was the Best Actress last year and also deserved her Oscar. I've already made my comments about Morgan Freeman.

Hey, everyone in Hollywood...You want to know how to make a great film? Put your mocha lattes down and get a primer lesson on film-making. Go see Million Dollar Baby.",
6 March 2005,"Drama, drama, drama....","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
20 October 2005,A triumphant drama about triumph,"I don't think I need to say much. Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. Clint showed his knowledge of capturing melancholy elements, and casting them out gratefully in Mystic River. This was different. Some may say that the drama in the film was the last 20 minutes, where the characters face a drastic experience, but that was not the main point.

Million Dollar Baby is a triumphant drama about triumph. We see Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) triumph and conquer her way through boxing matches by hard work, determination, and the love of her boxing trainer named Frankie. (played by Clint Eastwood, himself) We hear Morgan explain ""If there's magic in boxing, its the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.""

The story is narrated by Mr. Scrap. (played by Morgan Freeman) They couldn't have chosen a better choice. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator; he captures the emotion in the scenes where it is necessary. After all, why would of he narrated in March of the Penguins and War of the Worlds? Most dramas have plenty of emotion, but those with a short attention span will probably not realize it, because of all the dialogue. This is different.

There is just something about this movie that makes it so beautifully touching. The music that Clint showed off in Unforgiven is apparent here. The acting is better than good- It's so excellent.

Million Dollar Baby knows when to be light-hearted and fun, and when to be moody and depressing. For example, in the first scenes, Clint shows off how much heart he can really put into a movie with the bond between Maggie and Frankie. The film becomes even more fun with some jokes added here and there. ""You spent so much time on the floor, that I thought the canvas had a pair of titties."" Crude, but hilarious. During the final scenes, the film goes on kind of long, but Clint Eastwood still manages to show all the heart he can put into a movie, and he knows how to put in the dark and tragic elements he added into many other films.

Million Dollar Baby does have some dialogue, but manages to grab a hold of your interest. There is a certain unexplainable feeling that is in the movie. It seems to have a magical quality to it. Maybe it's the fact that the relationship between Maggie and Frankie is sweet and beautiful. (Beware, it is not a romance.) It could be that you think of a girl-who knows she's poor trash-work as hard as she can with the love of Frankie. Or, it could just be the fun boxing scenes, where people beat each other up. Who knows? This is surely one of the greatest and most memorable films of the year. Not many other films capture the glory of victory like this one does. Million Dollar Baby is truly triumphant, beautiful, touching and almost flawless. There are simply not enough words to describe it.

Best Picture is only the start of the praise that this film truly deserves.

10/10

Good: Beautiful, good boxing scenes, full of heart and joy, funny, carries a certain light-hearted tone throughout

Bad: The last scene is pretty long",10
15 July 2005,Powerful,"Frankie (Eastwood) agrees to take on a girl fighter (Swank) to make a run for the title.

To borrow a few words from the late Selma Diamond (Night Court): I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.

I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie as this one. All good. The dialog was simply the best. And, a lot of it was funny, really good stuff.

And, get this: this was the first draft by the screen writer, Paul Haggis. Eastwood didn't want to change anything. Something, eh? I know this from watching the second DVD in the package.

Eastwood, Freeman and Swank worked nothing short of a classic. All the acting was first class. You won't forget this one. The boxing scenes were real, I believe. If not, you could have fooled me. Yes, I watched the other movies up for Best Picture and said that Million Dollar Baby better be better than good to beat this group. WOW! That is all I can say. The others, while good, never really stood a chance. You'll see.

There is only one little thing that really didn't fit. Frankie gives Maggie a robe to wear into boxing rings. The words on the back are in Greek or Gaelic. He tells her that he will tell her what the words mean when she wins the big one. She wins a number of fights leading up to the title fight wearing the robe. In today's world, those words would have been mentioned in magazines, newspapers, TV spots etc. Also, some fans might have called out the meaning too. Maybe it was just a case of Maggie wanting to hear the words from Frank. Maybe. Anyway, go see the movie and you, too, will learn what the words mean. No, you don't have to fight anyone, just pay for the ticket or the DVD rental.

As much as I liked this movie, it still did not make me a fan of women boxing. Doesn't make sense to me. But, this movie made sense and is really one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Oh, yeah, it's not just about boxing.",10
13 August 2006,"A much more poignant, heartfelt Rocky","I absolutely hate boxing - I find it to be a truly inhumane sport (it's not even a sport; it's people inflicting maximum pain and damage on each other), and I always saw Hilary Swank as just a pair of silicone implants and a horsey smile. But I AM a sucker for films in which the characters (reluctantly) team up to accomplish a goal, whether it is a heist or winning a boxing title.

Combine this with the heartwarming, mandatory Morgan Freeman narrative of the film and I have endless affection for it. Well, not endless perhaps - but it is a well-crafted quality drama with superb acting performances and exciting boxing games. Clint Eastwood as grumpy veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on Maggie (Hilary Swank) has got to be one of the most likable characters in film. There is also quite a bit of humour in the first half of the film when he begins coaching her. I love it how he is never disturbed by Maggie's stubbornness, just sort of exasperated.

The film delicately sees these two personalities juxtaposed with each other to overcome initial difficulties and in the end, develop a strong father-and-daughter like bond. It sounds corny, but it translates very well on screen and I do not remember the last time I was as engrossed in a character's struggle as I was with Maggie's, which tells me Million Dollar Baby is doing something right. Very right.

When Paul Haggis' (of the horrorshow Crash) name popped up in the end credits as screenwriter, I was quite stunned but it made sense later on - because the writing of Million Dollar Baby is very explicit and spelled-out for audiences. That said, it is not as bad as Crash. Had I known Haggis had written it, I probably would have avoided it for a while longer in fear of being met by a blinking sign over a character's head that says ""THIS PERSON IS SAD"" .

As far as sport-themed films go, Million Dollar Baby is a grand accomplishment that projects so much heart that I must have cried nearly all the way through the second half.

6 December 2022,After Thoughts,"Phew! My gosh! What a movie. As a viewer you feel like you just got off an emotional roller-coaster. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job directing and acting in this movie. The range of emotion show from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman is astounding. And the shot and writing for this movie are tuned perfectly. This has to be one of, if not my favorite boxing movie ever. I learn more and more that Clint Eastwood's movies that he directed are becoming some of my favorites of all time. I cannot recommend this movie more, I give it my highest praises and it is definitely going on my list of top movies ever!

10 January 2006,Worth Every Dollar!,"Clint Eastwood is always at his best. This movie in my opinion tops ""UNFORGIVEN"", hands down. Yet, this is ""UNFORGIVEN's"" equal. Hilary Swank was great playing the heavily determined boxer. If it hadn't been for her tenacity, she would automatically given up. Morgan Freeman who worked with Eastwood in ""UNFORGIVEN"" is back with him. He's the more somber character in the movie, while Eastwood plays the harden one. Given the spot to teach Maggie the ropes of boxing wasn't all its cracked up to be, at least it was Frankie's first to teach a girl. Maggie(Swank) is nothing like her role Julie in ""The Next Karate Kid"". In that movie, she was surly. Frankie Dunn(Eastwood) is nothing like ""Dirty"" Harry, yet he displays some hardcore attitude in the movie which makes it watchable. To me, Maggie was the person who show determination, and receives inspiration from Frank, cause to him, he's reminds her of her late father. Since she has complete distrust in her family, she tries to give them what they needed, in return, they ended up being ungrateful, so why send them something? All they want to do is snuff it up. This movie also shows that even the gruffest of all grumps can have a softer side. And it's the first I've seen Eastwood get soft. AWWWWW! But Hey! This movie was no hype. It's a clear winner to me! 5 stars!",10
6 March 2005,Hillary Swank can really box.,"Hillary Swank was very athletic in this film. She was as skilled as a professional boxer. Especially her left jab. A lot of men don't understand how to box. Fighting scenes were over done with grand ko punches. Real boxing does not have the ""Hollywood"" round-house that knocks the opponent flying.

Boxing aside, Morgan Freeman's contribution to this film is excellent. His work in film always makes me embrace his character immediately. I am so glad he won the Oscar for this performance. He was worthy of the Oscar on other occasions.

Clint Eastwood plays the same character he always plays. Good thing I enjoy that character. Not intended to criticize, John Wayne played the same character each time too.

28 February 2005,Superb is an understatement.,"When I first saw the Flyers for this film wasn't keen to see it. Female Boxing is not my kind of sport, figured it was ""Rocky"" with tits, and wondered why Eastwood had bothered. Fortunately I did make the effort and how rewarding is this picture. It absolutely deserves the Oscars it won, and again establishes Clint Eastwood as a legend in his own time. The fight part of the story, although superbly realized, is secondary to the relationship between the case hard boxing trainer (Eastwood) and a fiery ambitious young boxer (Swank) who wants to succeed at all costs. Initially Eastwood wants no part of training a girl, but with the help of Morgan Freeman (as a old fighter who works in the Gym) Swank at last convinces Eastwood to train her. With results that neither party could imagine, it will effect their lives, and brings them together against tragedy. A human and moving drama set against the gritty background of boxing rings and training gyms. Up there with ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" and ""Raging Bull"" (directed by Martin Scorsese who was pitted against Eastwood in the Academy Awards with ""The Aviator"") Eastwood made the film on a modest budget in less than 40 days shooting, which is a truly remarkable effort for a man in his 70's. Both directing and acting a lead role. One of the best ""boxing"" films ever produced, but more importantly one of the most human stories of love and ambition. The three leads all work beautifully as an ensemble in this finely crafted film, don't even think of missing it.",
30 June 2011,An absolutely excellent example of filmcraft . . . engaging on so many levels,"This film really surprised me, in that I am not a ""boxing movie"" type at all, not even remotely, and in general not particularly interested in the sports / boxing saga type of genre'.

But in this piece, the character development, the way that the various threads of lives and story are woven together into a compelling tapestry is well crafted, and performed.

The entire piece completely transcends the usual sort of cliché' components that are so typical in other such films of the genre'.

Of course, I must confess that I could watch Hillary Swank in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work.

Clint Eastwood really has matured as a talented director, which was the other major surprising aspect of this film.

The pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly as the story becomes evermore detailed, the background of her family history and the strange (but highly believable) collection of characters in that family, and of course, Clint's character as the father searching for an answer, a resolution to a seemingly impossible personal quest.

There are no weak links or dull moments in any of this, but the ending is . . . difficult to accept, not because of a lack of credibility, but rather for the exact opposite reason, in that the hard edge of life's challenges do indeed become manifest in their own unexpected ways.

No clues beyond that will be offered here, though I will offer one parting thought for consideration.

This is one of those films that I can (and have) watch time and again, and still discover an engaging experience every time.

Rarely do I suggest a rating of 10, for any genre' of film, but in this case, I do so without the slightest hesitation.",10
21 May 2022,The Noble Art of Self Defense,"Clint Eastwood claims that he learned to direct when he starred in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns in the 60's. And you have to look quite hard to find a better teacher.

Something Eastwood demonstrates in ""Million Dollar Baby"". The film is part of a long tradition of boxing movies that Hollywood has always been fascinated by. Just think of classics like ""Rocky"" or ""Raging Bull"".

But this time the story centers around a young, female fighter. It reveals a lot about Clint Eastwood's talent as a director that Hillary Swank manages to create such a convincing portrait in the leading role.

So, this is a good watch even for those who don't happen to be interested in the ""noble art of self-defense"".

30 July 2005,Fine until insincere final reel,"Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a gutsy bundle of spit and verve who wants more than anything in the entire known universe to be a boxing champeen. So she takes her novice skill level to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), notable trainer of he-man boxers. Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie. At least until she can find a manager. Which she never does.

Swank again gets the Oscar nod (she also won for Boys Don't Cry), but this isn't her show at all - it's that of the two old codgers, Eastwood and Freeman. Freeman's excellence finally gets the level of recognition it deserves, as he won an Oscar, too, and Eastwood won for Best Director.

The first three-quarters of the movie is pretty standard little-punk-against-all-the-odds fare, kind of a step or two above The Karate Kid, but along the same lines. Scrap and Frankie impart wisdom both practical and metaphysical to Maggie, who nods and flashes the largest set of teeth this side of a sabre-toothed tiger. Seriously, Hilary should look into getting those things capped or chiseled down, or something. Swank's job is to look innocent and deserving, but still appear skillful and eager to learn more. Eastwood and Freeman just need to look smart and worldly, not to mention world-weary. All succeed in these broad characterizations.

The final quarter of the movie, though, takes us on a sharp left turn away from the norm. I won't give away the plot turn - it's not a twist, just a turn - but it quickly moves the tone of the movie from inspirational to sappy, from Rocky to Lifetime cable movies. As the audience, we're supposed to feel for Maggie, no matter what happens, and that almost works against things here; Maggie Fitzgerald is shown as a saint, quite frankly. Everything she does seems to be right, or at least Well Intentioned, and most people on the planet aren't quite that ethereal.

Still, it's tough not to root for the little dickens. Maggie's feisty and is determined to succeed; no small feat, considering she's scrawny even after a couple years of self-training. She's motivated by having been told how much of a loser she is throughout her life (she's 31 when the movie begins); if she's unsuccessful as a fighter, she has nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. Presumably, anyway. She's waitressing, after all, and does have a job when she begins training with Frankie, so she's really not as bad off as she wants to appear.

The chemistry between the toothy Swank and the toothless Eastwood should have been fantastic - Oscar winners both, of course - but for me their verbal interplay fell flat. I felt like I was watching two people do a cold reading. On the other hand, old pros Eastwood and Freeman played off each other perfectly, for dramatic and comedic effects. Their scenes together - and one gets the impression that Freeman's Scrap Iron wasn't as huge a character in the original version of the script - were flawless and highly enjoyable to watch, sort of like seeing a married couple interact.

As with most athletics-related movies, Million Dollar Baby will try to manipulate you, and it's fairly successful in that arena. However, the final reel of the movie just didn't completely work for me, seeming more like a disease-of-the-week teleplay than an Academy Award-winning movie.",7

5 March 2022,A Raw Emotional Powerhouse - Raging Bull For The Millennium,"What do I say? Epic Direction. Really intense ring footage. Really nice narrative by Sir Morgan Freeman. The script is polished. The acting is first class. It really delivers a huge knock-out and it's for me the best boxing movie after Raging Bull!

The ending is extremely tragic and raw. The only thing I am not sure about is the casting for her mother and how different she is to her. However the accents and regional hillbillyisms are played superbly.

It's totally raw and in-your-face. The script is excellent. I love the little plays in the gym between boxers. Really romanticising boxing. The brutal honesty of boxing and the money and fixing is open and blatant. I'm not sure with modern sport regulations if that would happen now.

Hillary Swank is a mesmerising actor. I really feel for her for how hard this movie was to make. A true powerhouse actor who really emulated Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull. Absolutely superb performance!

The chemistry was fantastic. Morgan and Eastwood both together is a pleasure to view. Absolutely on top of their game. The film really touches on how difficult it must be to run a boxing gym.

Some of the comedy in this black film is fantastic. It's a real emotional roller-coaster of a movie. I especially loved Jay Baruchel.as Danger Barch and. Special mentions for Anthony Mackie and Mike Colter for very believable roles.

I just loved the movie. The only thing I thought which did not make it a 10 is how different her mum was from her. The shot at the end also made me question something too! However it's a minor issue in an otherwise epic movie.

Really fantastic direction and acting from Sir Clint Eastwood too. What a powerhouse. Now he is a powerhouse director and actor. I would like him to make a few more sports' movies before his long overdue retirement!

What a movie backed by a stella cast with excellent dialogue and a great script. So much action and drama. Evocative of Raging Bull and so refreshing to see a female lead for this genre!",9
10 January 2005,Morgan Freeman makes a good movie unforgettable,"Hilary Swank is great - she does not play the role, she is living the role. Clint Eastwood is the strong personality we know.

But Morgan Freeman makes the point here.

It is a story of love - two people love each other without being aware, and when they get aware it seems to them that each one spoiled the life of the other. Actually they fulfilled each other's life, only they are not aware.

There is a third personage - modest, wise, discreet, reliable. He witnesses their love and their blossom and he will remember their love and their blossom, and he will tell us their love and their blossom. He understands them both, because he loves them both - he loves their love. He is the friend, the witness, the narrator - due to him their love lives, their love has its own life, beyond them - due to him.

And this is Morgan Freeman. Due to his play, a very good movie becomes unforgettable.",
16 January 2005,Moving,"This bare, emotional movie is the best that Eastwood has ever done in my opinion. For me, it's not because it has a ruthless, touching ending. So many people have written about it better than I can. I loved this movie because of the atmosphere that Eastwood created.

The movie had a lot of stretches. For me, the story line is too fantastical. It's hard to imagine that a prized fighter would train in such a run-down decrepit old gym. Isn't it a coincidence that two exceptional fighters would both come out of the same gym seemingly in the middle of nowhere, white trash America? But this movie was so realistic in its dialog that I forgot about all that. You could smell the sweat in that gym and it had such a homey feel to it, it made you believe that people would spend all day there. This is a character movie with fantastic actors who did it justice. Why isn't anyone talking about giving Morgan Freeman a nomination?

6 February 2005,Mark of a Great Storyteller,"I was in no hurry to see MILLION DOLLAR BABY. I am not a fan of boxing films, and I still think the title is less than stellar. And after seeing it, I haven't changed my opinion that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is the best film I've seen so far in the 21st century.

But number two of the century for me is now MILLION DOLLAR BABY.

It's not the story itself that makes this such a great film. The story with it's surface emphasis on underdogs and redemption is actually fairly routine. It is the way Clint Eastwood tells this story, the way he gets such understated yet magnificent performances from his cast, the brilliant use of lighting, of story pacing through editing, his unobtrusive but highly effective music...This film is a textbook example of the best of film storytelling that should be studied by film students in this generation and the next. And the next, and the next...

This is not a film about boxing. This is a film about human beings, their hopes, fears, flaws, and potential for transcendent greatness, sometimes through staggering self-sacrifice. It is told with such love and compassion for the human condition that it gives me a little much-needed faith that maybe the human race is still capable of more than the mundane goals it seems to be setting for itself lately.

The supporting performances are uniformly excellent. But the three leads reach levels of acting on a par with any great performance you'd care to name in film history. I have not been a Hilary Swank fan. But her work here forces me to acknowledge that she is one of the best in her profession. And just when I thought Morgan Freeman couldn't get any better, here he is with the best performance I have ever seen from him. And considering his past work, that is really saying something.

And speaking of best performances, here the legendary Clint Eastwood crowns his career with a titanic performance that redefines him as an actor for the ages. And trust me, the fact that he did it while simultaneously having to spend so much time and loving care on this film as a director makes his work as an actor all the more amazing. Consider this, too: if MDB had been someone else's film, would that director or producer even have thought to cast him in this role?

I didn't really expect to be saying these things about this film. But I mean every word of it.",8

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
13 February 2005,Directing Perfection for Eastwood,"Let me say first that I am no fan of Clint Eastwood's movies. I didn't like 'Unforgiven' or 'Mystic River,' both critics' darlings, so I was expecting something along the same vein for this film. In both those other films the focus is on men. In this case, it's Hillary Swank's character, Maggie, and it makes all the difference for me because I like a little estrogen in my films. The story is enthralling and character driven - with a focus on all three characters. Now some are very upset by the ending of the film but I felt complete empathy and so did Joe, who I had to basically bribe to see the movie. And he LOVED it. The direction of the film is perfection - Eastwood uses incredible shadow work and several styles that enhance the story so much, that I can't imagine any other director doing the film. While I saw some editing problems in Aviator, and some flaws in the directorial shots, I saw NONE of that here, and I've read Eastwood took only a little over a month to shoot it. Amazing! He wins best director in my mind.

The acting is fantastic - I can't even put into words how the actors melt into their characters. I didn't see Clint Eastwood - I saw cut man Frankie Dunn. I loved Jamie Foxx in Ray, but for me Eastwood won the Oscar for me. Of course Swank is awesome (I even loved her in Next Karate Kid) and should also win the Oscar. Morgan Freeman is always perfect and his chemistry with Eastwood is better than any other film I've seen yet this year.

Normally I wouldn't recommend seeing a movie like this on the big screen but the boxing scenes are so cool that I would say it is worth the price of admission. See it!",10
21 February 2005,"""Baby"" carries a powerful punch and knock-out performances","""Million Dollar Baby"" is really two films in one. A classic underdog story about a white trash waitress who wants to be a boxer. She comes from a small poor trailer town and saves whatever money she earns to give to her thankless mother back home. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald and she is good natured and only wants to fulfill her dream. She knows that Frankie Dunn, an aging struggling gym owner and former trainer is the man to get her there.

Clint Eastwood plays Frankie and he's fighting his own demons. He attends church every day for no apparent reason. He isn't sure why he goes everyday, but he just feels he needs to make up for his lost daughter and his empty career. When Maggie appears in his gym for guidance, he sends her on his way, but she keeps coming back because of her determination and he eventually gives in. The two of them form an unusual bond. They ultimately need each other. She needs him to help her dream come true and as a father figure. Frankie sees Maggie as the daughter who'll return his letters and be in his life.

The boxing sequences aren't focal or anything special, but they're well directed and simple. Eastwood accomplishes what he needs to with these. The story is about the characters. It's not a boxing film. Naturally, Maggie gets better and better and a title match ensues.

While the first portion of the film is a true underdog story, the rest of it is a tearjerker as something unexpected occurs. Both portions blend well together and you'll be weeping like a baby. The film is a story about commitment, dedication, family, and redemption.

All the roles are carefully laid out and as Eastwood has gotten older and older, he has gotten better and better as a director. Like, last years ""Mystic River"", he directs his scenes with simplicity and he does it carefully without being too flashy. He lets his actors carry his films. Speaking of which, Hilary Swank is nothing short of amazing. She hits every right note as the naive woman who wants nothing more than to follow her dream and have a better life than she knows she has. Eastwood is terrific too. His best roles and acting jobs are when he is playing characters his own age. He hits the right notes more times than not. Morgan Freeman narrates the film and sort of plays the conscience of the film, like he did in Shawshank Redemption.

I don't know if ""Million Dollar Baby"" will come home with Oscar gold. It's not as flashy as ""The Aviator"", but it's a better film and it will have you talking when you leave the film. (****)",
29 August 2019,Highly moving and deeply touching,"Excellently played by Eastwood, Freeman and Swift. Brilliantly told and slowly but persisently developed story. A story of dreams and determination, of love and suffering, of rises and downfalls. You´re suffering and celebrating together with all main characters, and reflecting on life. A wonderful movie.

15 March 2005,Congartulations for not being 100% Hollywood infected,"The film is only in 50% Hollywood like: the exchanges about ""mummy"" and ""daddy"", so straightforward and psychologically simplified, are disadvantage. As if Eastwood didn't have enough trust to the audience - he had to make all the father-figure metaphors, hints and parallels so evident... ""American Dream"", fabulous for a European like me, in this film becomes a probable option - maybe because the possible interpretations of the ""success"" that the film gives are not all too one-sided (see ""Scrap's"" or Danger's"" story, for example, although Eastwood is not resolute to explore the theme of a seeming failure as some sort of personal success to the end. At times he even lets us believe that what really matters is the ""title"" or having one's moment of glory. ) What I loved about the film was its anti-Hollywood features: minimalistic scenery, meaningful play of shadow and light - at times poetic and speaking volumes, when the faces emerge from the darkness, plus quintessential language (except for the ""psychoanalytic"" utterances, fortunately, not abundant in the film). Very interesting and deep study of the relationship between the master and the apprentice - subtle, complex, moving and, thank God, not melodramatic as the Hollywood filmmakers would typically have it. A good movie, amazing even for a European taste brought up on Kieslowski's or Stuhr's films...",9
18 April 2005,Superb drama about a dream that results in a nightmare,"NO SPOILERS. Million Dollar Baby stands for teaching us the meaning of ""the dream come true"" motto that everyone tries to achieve during life. A woman that came from an unknown poor town seeks a dream in a sleazy box gymnasium and hopes to be trained by a well-reputed elderly man that once was called the best stitch man outside the ring. The movie is packed with human drama and a bit of comedy moments with one Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood at their best. Although this movie is about boxing, the main attention and script runs far beyond this subject, taking us to a journey into the world of this violent sport as well to an emotional aura, lots of drama, human behavior, courage, determination and doggedness.

This film deserved all the Oscars nominated to it and I would advise you as a must to see... and don't get panicked if at the end of it a pair of oversuspicious tears come out of your eyes... it's pure drama at its best.

4 February 2005,A GREAT love story,"I'm tempted to say that Million Dollar Baby is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but I'll want to wait and get a little perspective before I do. But one thing I can say is that it moved me like no other movie has done for a long time. And the three principles are awesome I'm their performances.

This is a love story; the love of two men for a sport; the love of a youngster for what that sport may make possible; the love of a father-figure for his young charge. Clint Eastwood lovingly handles the story with grace and rare perspective. He coaxes award-winning performances from his cast and handles the twists and turns of his complicated story with a deftness rare in today's Directors. I was blown away.

30 January 2005,Certainly in my top 10 of all time movies,"This was an absolutely beautiful movie. It jabs you in the gut and pummels your heart. Not only was the screenplay and direction fantastic, but the trio of Swank, Eastwood, and Freeman was a superb match! I love it when Morgan Freeman's craft shines! He is a fantastic actor, that unfortunately takes the occasional not so good script (can we say Dreamcatcher), but you give this man a worthy script, and he lights the screen with his presence! As for Clint Eastwood, this role for me is one of the most enjoyable I've seen him play recently. Of course, Hilary Swank as Maggie was absolutely fantastic! Her character was humble and gutsy, and she portrayed Maggie superbly! I can't recommend this film enough. Go see it now!

1 February 2005,"Good film, not deserving of it's praise.","So what is all this talk about Million Dollar Baby about? Well it is a good film, mostly directing. Clint I believe has himself another Oscar (Sorry Marty). The film does indeed look and feel real, which is a good relief from the recent Big Budget Fantasy films. Clint handles the characters extremely well and gives them each their moment in the sun.The gritty old feel of this film is perfect for it's style and the theme of boxing. Everyone gives great performances, unfortunately, Swank, doesn't deliver on the level of expectancy. Don't get me wrong, she does a very well job of giving the character emotion and depth and you feel for this girl, but it seems like we've seen it before and it becomes clichéd.

The script was well written, the film actually becomes something of it's own in the third act, which is the best part of the film. Morgan Freeman and Clint both deliver great performances which saved the film from being another random ""Oscar"" movie, is this Clint's best? NO Is it this years best? No, Is it going to Win an Oscar? Yes, because it's the Oscars...",8
9 March 2005,Ready-built for tragedy,"Story of a young, eager female boxer (Hilary Swank), her manager (Clint Eastwood, who also directed) and his assistant (Morgan Freeman) certainly impressed the Academy, winning four Oscars out of seven nominations. Eastwood's directing career has brought forth some very spotty pictures; when he loses his dryly-askew sense of humor, the filmmaker can get awfully one-dimensional. ""Million Dollar Baby"" comes ready-built for tragedy. It has sympathetic characters, strong performances from its cast, and an intriguing scenario that doesn't initially appear to follow a well-trodden formula. However, by the second-half, both Mike Haggis' screenplay (adapted from F. X. Toole's ""Rope Burns"" stories) and Eastwood's agenda have changed dramatically--from a character portrait into a wallow (it's never quite a ""boxing moving"", per se). Haggis seems to be saying that life is rough--for the girl, for her manager, for the assistant, and for the (God help us) mental kid who hangs out at the gym in a gratuitous subplot (designed to give mentor Freeman a few extra scenes). It's an occasionally unpleasant and queasy picture which skirts soap opera territory. Eastwood is an intelligent and caring actor-director (who also provides the somber, quietly effective mood music on the soundtrack), and yet the assembly-line progression of situations here are disappointingly trotted out. The finale is indeed moving, but the set-up for it is almost mechanical. ** from ****",5
27 March 2023,Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' packs an emotional punch with powerful performances and nuanced storytelling,"""Million Dollar Baby"" directed by Clint Eastwood is a gripping and emotional tale of a female boxer who strives to achieve greatness in the ring. With outstanding performances from its cast, this film is a masterful exploration of the human spirit, determination, and the bond between trainer and fighter.

Hilary Swank delivers a raw and intense portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, a waitress turned boxer, who teams up with veteran trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood, to pursue her dream. The chemistry between Swank and Eastwood is palpable, and their performances make for a powerful and moving experience.

The film is also elevated by its excellent supporting cast, with Morgan Freeman giving a standout performance as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Frankie's former boxer and close friend. The characters in the film are complex, and the relationships between them are layered and nuanced, adding depth and richness to the story.

The film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with its moody lighting and close-up shots conveying the intensity and physicality of the boxing matches. The score is equally impressive, complementing the film's emotional moments with a poignant and stirring soundtrack.

Ultimately, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a profound and touching film that explores the themes of perseverance, sacrifice, and the power of the human spirit. It's a must-see for fans of drama and sports movies alike.",10

26 December 2020,"Instead of watching ''It's a Wonderful Life'' on Christmas, I've watched this.","And it torn me apart. I have to recognize that Clint Eastwood has a talent in telling great stories about people who win by losing. I was impressed when I first saw his great anti-war story fueled and filled by/with humanity , 'Letters from Iwo Jima'' , but now he's taken one step further and hit close to home for me.

Maybe it wasn't the best time of the year to see it but hey, luckily this Christmas feels a bit different due to the pandemic and maybe something unconventional is a good idea after all.

25 January 2007,Three of the best performances on film,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing trainer whose daughter is painfully estranged from his life. He doesn't take risks with his fighters, he's calculated and protective; leaving him less than successful at his art.

Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) is a wannabe boxer, with an remarkable and unshakable focus on success; but her age is against her. Her family are less than supportive of her ambitions, and they are disrespectful to her in-spite of her desire to do the best by them.

When Frankie begrudgingly agrees to teach Maggie, they learn to share a common feeling of fulfilment, and find the sense of family that they have both lost, in each other.

Morgan Freeman plays an integral part in the story, his is Dunn's helping hand in the gym, while also being his council and his guide; but he is also the narrator of the story, in a very similar manner to the one used in the Shawkshank Redemption.

Eastwood's direction is sublime, again he proves his knowledge of what a film needs to truly tell a story and compel an audience. All of the support characters are interesting, sometimes funny, but always well portrayed; the story itself is excellent, it has power and passion, and if it fails to provoke your emotions then i'm afraid you may in fact be dead.

What completes this masterpiece is the performances of the leads players -

Eastwood is typically brilliant, he's inspiring and impossible to take yours eyes off.

Freeman is on top form, he's faultless and plays the voice of reason and rationality throughout the film.

And finally Swank, she is simply awesome in this role, her physical ability as a boxer is astounding enough, but when coupled with her exemplary acting talent, she commands the screen in every scene with ease - Awesome

Whatever your expecting in this film, it won't fail to move you or impress you; it's a masterpiece 10/10",10

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

19 December 2021,Eastwood's Finest Film - A Future Classic,"I'm not a fan of drama's, I watch film for escapism. But I do make few exceptions and in rare cases they pay off, Million Dollar Baby is a fine example of this, it tells the story of a young woman who has a big dream to become the best at boxing. Sounds cliché doesn't it? Yet, Eastwood gives a lesson in film-making, driven by a performance from Swank that has been burned into my mind for the foreseeable future. Swank's character Maggie Fitzgerald slowly grows into a capable fighter, but the fights feel like the side-story in this film about discovering how hard life can hit you(quoting Rocky here seems fitting). I cannot remember a film ending that hit me harder, I wept for a good few minutes and considering I'm not a fan of drama's and am pretty dried eyed, this should give you an idea of what to expect. But nothing will prepere you for this journey through the vivid and heart-breaking story of a young girl trying to make it. Supported by a strong cast including the man behind the scenes and legendary Freeman. This film is a must watch for anyone asking ""how could it be worse?"" Eastwood is about to give you a run for your money. I feel like movies like this will be missed, Cinemas are being flooded with superhero films, makes me wonder, Has the film industry taken a wrong turn? Sure an action-flick is great escape, but it feels so hollow when you see perferfomences like Swanks. Imagine being a fan of film and not knowing about this? I envy you, theres few films that gave me the whiplash that MDB did. Fewer even with a lead that gave me goosebumps. It's a shame that Swanks talent's are being wasted lately, as she's an actress that deserves better.",9
7 February 2020,sad drama without a happy ending,"The story was OK and reminiscent of Creed (Rocky). The plot was also OK, but makes you sad. I don't really like dramas without a happy ending because it makes me depressed.

17 March 2005,Brilliant!!,"This is a kind of a movie you want to keep in your collections, because these kind never gets old.

Hilary Swank gave out her best performance yet. It's a performance you want to see holding an Oscar. Beautiful script and an excellent story. Eastwood knew exactly how far to stretch the tragedy, which he might have missed in the Mystic River.

A smooth touch by some very strong performances from the supporting actors like Freeman and Baruchel get every bit of the beginning of the movie going. And when Swank takes it off, it's all about her. The movie shows how the character grows in mental strength with every fight and breaks apart with just one truth. Swank's performance was so great along with the script that you don't even feel the change until it was obvious.

I personally think it was better than Raging Bull. I think it connects you emotionally more to the character than the Bull's. All in all a great entertainer and a must see movie.",10
5 January 2006,"Agree or disagree with it's controversial ending,you'll come away knowing you just watched a powerful drama.","Clint Eastwood just continues to top himself as a film maker.His latest masterpiece is Million Dollar Baby.This powerful,moving drama will have you cheering,as well as bring you to tears.All performances are memorable,particularly that of Hilary Swank.It is not often,in my opinion,that Oscars go to the right people.This is indeed a rare case of the award being given to the rightful person.Eastwood shines just as much in front of the camera as well as behind it,and he never goes wrong pairing himself with Morgan Freeman,whose Oscar was also well deserved(he was long overdue).The ending is a controversial one,as you will see,or probably have heard about in advance.Whether or not you agree with it,you will come away knowing that you have just watched an overwhelmingly powerful,dramatic film,proof that Clint Eastwood has indeed matured as a director.Like fine wine,he gets better with age.

13 March 2006,"If MDB isn't a ""10,"" then what is? As Ebert says, ""A masterpiece.""","10/10 This is why they invented the video camera. Absolutely moving film. Tremendous acting by the three main characters. It is hard to think of Clint Eastwood as the High Plains Drifter anymore - he has simply achieved a brilliant work of art, both with his directing and his acting. What this movie boils down to is people who learn to love one another and then take care of each other during extreme hardship. This is a love story, but not a romance. I wonder if I shall ever see another movie this good. Did I mention I really liked this film? In addition to a riveting story, the film deals with a contentious social issue of our century. I doubt if anyone gets so far to read this review after so many others, but if you've made it this far - SEE THIS MOVIE!!

9 January 2005,"Move over Raging Bull, you have a sister","With the release of Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood has officially entered the sweepstakes for golden statues in 2005. Already nominated for Five Golden Globes including Best Picture and Director, expect the same when the Academy announces its category finalists on January 25.

Written by Paul Haggis (a Canadian that has spent most of his time writing for the small screen) and based on stories by longtime boxing manager and cutman Jerry Boyd (under the pen name, F.X Toole), the story surrounds boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes on a persistent female boxer named Maggie (Hilary Swank).

The start of the film is textbook storytelling and you can see most of what is going to happen before it unfolds. Dunn is the reclusive manager that is reluctant to take on a female as a client believing that boxing is a sport for the Y-Chromosome's only - ""Girlie tough is not tough enough"" he mutters.

But when a career waitress with aspirations of making a name for herself in the ring shows up in the gym with a work ethic that continues long after the lights are turned out, Dunn becomes intrigued by her determination and takes her under his tutelage.

It is here that that Million Dollar Baby begins to separate itself from the formulaic. Although there is plenty of ringside action, the movie somehow is able to have the gruesome boxing matches as only a back drop for what becomes a budding relationship between the two leads. Match after match and day after day, Dunn and Maggie become closer, sharing each others hopes and dreams and inviting each to share in family experiences.

But just when you think you have figured out where Million Dollar Baby is headed, it takes a sharp turn. One of those turns that we as critics like to see but hate when we have to review. The last third of the movie revolves around the consequences and situations of the device and it would be a disservice to anyone reading a review to have it revealed.

So, we focus on the positives of the first two-thirds. The wonderful understated performance by Morgan Freeman (together again with Eastwood after 1991's, Unforgiven), as former boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, for example. Freeman is the driving force of the growing relationship between the two leads and pushes the story along with such subtlety and effortless motion as to put him also in line for a golden nomination.

Even the tiny little subplots work well to create atmosphere and build character. The characters that participate in daily training at Dunn's gym, Maggie's trailer-living family and Dunn's estranged daughter are all crafted masterfully by director Eastwood into telling a moving story that will haunt you long after you leave the theatre.

Client Eastwood struck gold with Mystic River last year and hits the same vein with Million Dollar Baby. It is his 25th attempt behind the camera and he just gets better with experience (I will forgive him for Bloodwork, but barely). I think this new career high for Eastwood is because he simply 'gets it'. He understands that life doesn't have happy endings all the time. That movies don't have to put an aging acting icon together romantically with a young budding actress in order to get audiences to take notice. And that movies can just end when they should, not all wrapped in a bow.

It is surprising for this writer how boxing movies have had more critical success than any other sporting depiction despite the fact that the sport itself is in a time of mistrust, arguable decisions and no true heavyweight icon like Ali and Foreman were back in its heyday. But when you take the Rocky's, Raging Bull's and now Million Dollar Baby into account you can argue that not even the Field of Dreams, Pride of the Yankees and Eight Men Out's can stand as consistently proud of their output.

That noted, Million Dollar Baby stands alone. Alone as a boxing movie. Alone as a character study, and alone as maybe the best film of 2004.

10 January 2005,Even Better After It Sits,"While watching this, I knew I was seeing a film that was completely engaging. It was paced really well and was top-heavy with wonderful performances. Eastwood is of the school of direction that favors substance over style, yet this film uses shadows and light as tools better than any film I can think of in the last 30 years (Since The Godfather). He also gives, here, his best performance ever. His is a risky performance, as an actor he pushes himself into emotional territory he had only touched on before. Hillary Swank is quite a bit of terrific, as well in a role that is solidly wonderful. She isn't stretching the same way Eastwood is, but is gritty and brave. Morgan Freeman is, like Swank, ""typically"" good, not reaching as far, but when you're Morgan Freeman, you really do not have to. The film is about choices and consequences, and, three days after seeing this, I cannot stop thinking about the implications of the last twenty-five minutes or so. The sign of a great film is what it does to you after it has a chance to settle in. On that basis alone, this ranks towards the top of a Master Director's list of Great Films. The movie hits you, yet the sting lingers long after. I mean that in the best possible manner.",10
12 March 2005,A film worthy of all its acclaim,"See this film without knowing anything about the plot. If you already do know something about the film plot I would guess that you would still enjoy it. The performances of Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman are excellent. One of the best directed films in decades. No special effects here. Rather just a a great story, well acted and directed superbly. The subject matter will make you think. As the old saying goes this film will make you laugh and cry. There is also more than one scene that made me and others in the audience clap. I saw it with my 16 year old daughter and would highly recommend that you see it with someone you love. You will want to hug and talk afterwords.

26 April 2005,Okay I saw this one Late,"I must admit I went to see this movie the day after the Oscars. I thought that it may be a good movie, but seeing it win all those awards made me want to see it.

O.k. probably being the last of you to see this movie then you already know this is agreat movie. With a extremely well written script. Clint Eastwood did an awesome job directing and playing the lead male role in this film.

This is much more than just a boxing film. This is a movie about the human condition. And one woman's journey to never give up at all costs.

This movie will be a great movie to add to your collection and undoubtedly it will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald.

16 February 2005,"One of Eastwood's Best, But A Very Different Film From Him","If there was a Clint Eastwood film that proves how great of a director and actor he is at the same time, this movie is it. This movie really extends his acting chops. It's one of his best performances in the likes of ""Unforgiven "" and the under looked ""Honky Tonk Man"". Hilary Swank was impressive as the leading lady. As always, Morgan Freeman was excellent. There was fine support, especially from Jay Baruchel, who has really grown since ""Undeclared"". What also makes this movie is the great story line. As the movie develops, you realize that Eastwood and Swank develop a non sexual relationship, in a way as father and daughter do. The movie ends in tragedy, but that just makes the movie better for me. This is the best picture of 2004, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

9 January 2005,Amazing piece of cinema,"Million Dollar Baby is a magnificent piece of cinema. It's as simple as that, really. It came very close to eclipsing Sideways as my choice for #1 film of the year, but I thought it had a few very slight flaws that prevented that from happening. Baby is one of those movies that (literally, in this particular case) seems to punch you in the gut. Clint Eastwood's last picture, the also magnificent Mystic River, left me with the same powerful, haunted feeling that this film does. I'm still reflecting and contemplating ideals of the movie despite it ending an hour ago. A lion's share of Million Dollar Baby's success must go to lead actress Hilary Swank, who completely immerses herself in the role and gives the best acting by a lead actress this year. Clint Eastwood himself is also very strong, and Morgan Freeman gives the movie his usual dose of quiet dignity. The one thing in Million Dollar Baby that I could've perhaps done without is the portrayal of a mentally retarded wannabe boxer played by Jay Baruchel, who comes off as perhaps too cartoonish. However, it's only a small section of the film. Baby takes an unexpected twist in its final 1/4, and it's easily one of the most emotional and truly sincere sections of a film in a very long time. Very highly recommended.",10

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1

1 September 2011,A depressing experience,"I've loved the majority of Eastwood's films as director in the last decade (and consider LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA to be one of the finest war films ever made), but MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a film that left me cold. On the face of it, there's nothing much to dislike: it's expertly crafted with Eastwood's eye for technical detail and cast members delivering Oscar-winning performances.

But, nonetheless, something didn't gel with me. It may be that the rags-to-riches boxing story is far too familiar, having been done decades ago in the much lower-budgeted ROCKY, a film with a simpler plot and worse actors that was far more powerful, thanks to its raw heartfelt emotion. In contrast, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is ice-cold, and something feels very staged about it.

Swank is believable as the female boxer, but once again I felt no empathy for her character (Swank, like Cate Blanchett, never seems to get the audience on side). Eastwood and Freeman feel tired, both just giving yet another variation on already familiar character types. The pacing is slow and the running time overlong, making the storyline feel stretched out; the last hour or so is particularly painful to watch.

I enjoy movies because they're entertaining and I often prefer escapism over highbrow intellectualism. Despite the professionalism of its cast and crew, MILLION DOLLAR BABY forgets to be entertaining, and I disliked it for that reason.",4
19 July 2005,Terrible movie in many ways,"I thought I was going to see THE movie of the year. Must have been a bad year.

Aside from the factual inaccuracies of the portrayal of a quadriplegic woman, the stereotypical ""white trash"" family, the cartoonish boxing, and the ridiculous ""Danger"" character, it was OK.

In the end, the movie proves to be a cheap political statement, and sends a terrible message in the process. I was paralyzed from the shoulders down at age 18. I'm not on a ventilator as Swank's character is, but I am totally dependent on others for feeding, dressing, etc.

This movie just perpetuates the myth that sustaining such an injury leads to a meaningless life. Swank can choose between school and death, and she chooses death. Thank you for setting the disabled community back a few more years.

What have I done differently? I've gone to college, lived on my own, and work as a respected journalist in the community. Where is the story about someone like me? Why does every disabled person in a movie have to be a punchline in a joke or depressed and angry? For the record, my feelings about the message don't have any bearing on my feelings about the quality of the film. It just wasn't that great.

My opinion is the only reason it received such acclaim is a) Clint Eastwood, and b) it deals with a controversial subject. We know Hollywood loves to wax on political issues. If you watch this movie, please realize that the depiction of Swank as a quadriplegic is poorly researched. Hit me up if you want to know what it is really like.",1

15 February 2005,boxers' blues- one of the more notable points in Eastwood's career,"Something a friend of mine talked with me about after he and I had seen the film was a good point about the film's dramatic structure (which prompted me to see the film a second time, aside from knowing intrinsically it would get doused in Oscar liquid). It's like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn't say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don't know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn't. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it's also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn't.

Eastwood is better than usual as Frankie, a trainer and owner of a boxing gym. His friend and observer of the film's details, Scrap (Morgan Freeman, supreme in his understated performance), was once a boxer too, but with going too far with a fight, he became half-blind, but given a job and residence by a guilt-ridden Frankie (who is so for that and a few other things, some kept perfectly ambiguous). When he loses his boxer for being 'over-protective', a woman, Maggie (Hilary Swank, intuitive as always in her scenes), asks to be trained. After much convincing, Frankie takes her on, and little by little, he gets looser on his strict terms of not being questioned with his teachings. Then, as Maggie finally reaches the top, there comes what is called in screen writing as the second turning point, and the story turns its last act into the contemplative, the deep, and the tragic.

One thing that grabbed me even more so on a second viewing was that the theme of what boxing does to the human spirit and psyche is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as Scrap observes, it's ""un-natural"", to be moving around getting right in the face of pain and not running away, and how it is not a very glamorous 'sport' at all (a theme that makes it more worthy than a lessor boxing movie would give). On the other hand, it also goes in hand with the theme of having heart; the two supporting characters of Danger (in a satisfactory performance by Baruchel) and Shawrelle (Mackie), who are a major contrast. I really liked how Eastwood and writer Paul Haggis (from a book of short stories) dealt with the sub-plot to go so well with the main plot of Frankie, Scrap and Maggie. Another exceptional scene that makes this point clearer- and more resonant as the final act unfolds- is when Maggie gets a treat on her 33rd birthday from Scrap, and he tells his story about how he lost sight in his eye. In this scene, both of the actors are brilliant in their tone and reactions, it makes for one of the more meaningful, and dramatically compelling, pieces of the story.

I wouldn't say, as I said, that the film is entirely flawless (which is arguable, I know). One problem I had both times I saw it, though not overall, was with Morgan Freeman's narration. For the most part it is insightful and narratively correct, but unlike Freeman's key narration role (as the key observer in Shawshank Redemption), not every line seemed very crucial for the story. It is a simple story with simpler, sometimes philosophical notes of narration, but I sometimes wished that everything had to be outlined - one can sense things right in Eastwood's face and eyes while Freeman talks gruffly behind him. And, arguable still, the sheer simplicity of the film does leave it so that one can't figure out parts of the story for themselves.

Never-the-less, the film is an extraordinary stroke of skill for Eastwood as a director. If one can't say that his performance is one of his very best, one could say that his direction, his use of the camera (via DP Tom Stern), is at a peak. The way he uses his strokes of lighting and darkness, and with the way he can control the camera and not be (un-appropriately) flashy, makes it extremely professional. That he's been known to shoot scenes in one or two takes makes for such a sweetly spontaneous result, however totally controlled. Indeed, I agree whole-heartedly with one critic who said ""to call this an old man's film is a sincere compliment"", especially on the craftsman side. A-",8

13 February 2005,Don't read this review. Or any other.,"If you have not seen this movie, and you have any intention of doing so, see it right now. Stop reading. Reading about it will spoil it.

I make no claims about the brilliance or mediocrity of this film, nor about Eastwood's direction, his acting, Swank's acting, Freeman's acting, or anything else. Simply: if you find out too much about it, or become biased, either for or against it, you will be very sad indeed when you actually see it.

This film follows in the footsteps of Big Fish, Mulholland Dr., and In the Bedroom, in the sense that they need to be experienced before they can be discussed. Talking about the plot points of Mulholland Dr. without having seen it will take away the visceral experience that Lynch has created. Similarly, while Million Dollar Baby might be similar to /blank/, or follow the plot of /blank/, or be ""about"" /blank/, you have to see it with an open and uncluttered mind to understand why.

Many viewers, understandably, only see movies after reading all the reviews of it first. But, this one time, I ask you: take it on faith. See the movie. You'll be glad you did.",9
8 March 2005,MDB deserved best picture,"I am not the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood's earlier work but with MDB, Mystic River, and Unforgiven, I have gained a new respect for him. MDB is story of a young woman (Hilary Swank) who wants to realize her dream of becoming a boxer. The best part about this movie is that it starts out like Rocky but ends up being one of the best films that I have ever seen. Anyone who calls this movie overreacted is a special kind of moron. MDB blew away the competition for best picture with its tremendous performances, great plot, and powerful surprise ending. I remember thinking that there was no way this movie was as good as Roger Ebert said it was. Well I can happily say that Ebert was right and I'm going a step farther by saying this is one of the best films ever made.

7 January 2006,Terrific Movie,"I don't know if I can write a review on this. There are 83 pages of reviews  many of them good. Many are fair in both their praise and reservations. I found the details wonderful in both their simplicity and effect.

The film starts like something done as a film noir. In fact, Million Dollar Baby would have been an ideal candidate for black and white.

After winning a particularly brutal fight, Frankie Dunne's (Clint Eastwood) championship caliber boxer begs a favor. He asks Frankie to go get his wife's car back, which Frankie does. The boxer comes to thank Frankie, (we think, but there is hesitancy). He wants another manager and he leaves Frankie. Though it turns out to be a good move for the younger man professionally, it shows him to be rather thankless and ruthless. Certainly Frankie is not part of his family: he owes Frankie nothing. We don't see any loyalty and gratitude: just a cold business relationship.

Though there is no evidence in the film to suggest it, I think that explains why he so hesitant to take on Maggie. He spent eight years with the other fighter and he thinks he will have to spend another 4 on Maggie. It's too much. He's tired. He just wants to go to church write his weekly letters and banter with Scrape. We see Frankie begging for the easy way.

Perhaps that is why Scrape (Morgan Freeman) keeps needling him. He wants Frankie to try again. He sees something in Maggie and he instinctively knows she will be good for Frankie. Frankie doesn't know. He's a devout Catholic (about which his priest is almost totally opaque): he doubts he can stand the guilt of the failure of yet one more relationship.

The priest in the first scene is totally unsympathetic (or seems so). He asks Frankie if has written his daughter. Frankie tells him every week. We are led to believe that the priest does not believe him. It is a brutal miscalculation from the church's representative. Frankie is used to that: he deals with brutality daily. Why should the church be any different than the rest of his life? These details are foreshadows of what will come.

What Frankie finds in Maggie is a woman trusts her feelings. Probably the best part in the movie is the diner scene where Scrape tells us why he never had fight 110. Much has been said about this scene. (The best description is in Roger Ebert's review. Check it out). Maggie learns why Frankie is such a good manager. Maggie knows class when she hears it and she knows life poetry when it's spoken to her. Another manager? Not on her life.

There is nothing but love and loyalty in this girl. Contrast Frankie as a father with her actual mother. Maggie does everything a daughter should and her mother insists on treating her as a ten year old who has to be corrected. But Maggie knows some things and tries to be a kind loving adult daughter only to be reprimanded by a fool and a course lazy lout of a mother. It is no wonder she loves Frankie. He was the parent she never really had.

Now we come to the real spoiler. We find out that Frankie really has written his daughter once a week. He has kept all his letters (which were returned unread and unopened).

After a terrible event in the ring, Maggie has her neck broken. She is a vegetable compared to the way she was. She is not sorry. There are no heroics in any of her statements. She tells him that she has heard the crowds and she does not want the voices to go away. She wants to die. She wants him to help her. In her mind, she is the same as a crippled dog she had as a child. The dog finally had to be put down by her father.

He is horrified. He cannot do such a thing.

He goes to the priest. He is completely torn apart. Not even his daughter had this effect on him. His tears are those of someone in the deepest anguish.

He knows she's right. This was a girl who was nearly a champion athlete who now is not only confined to a bed but who can only be put in a wheel chair after hours of effort.

Perhaps because I'm not Catholic, I find the priest's attitude almost incomprehensible. He does not seem to be able to think outside the box. He gives Frankie the standard position about taking life and threatens alienation from the church and with it eternal damnation (the latter implied from the former). The priest does not truly see the problem and Frankie in tears, knows it.

Maggie will not accept life that is really a prolonged death and tries to commit suicide by biting her tongue. It is then that Frankie knows what he has to do. It is the tenderest scene in the move. It is so touching that no one with feelings can avoid registering the over powering human conflicts that take only minutes to show. It is one of the great love scenes ever made. Who knew that Dirty Harry had it in him? In the end we are left with Scrape who tries to explain to Frankie's daughter the nature of the man she has stubbornly refused to have anything to do with. She is making a terrible mistake in not acknowledging him. Scrape does it not for Frankie. He does it for her.

If there are people who thought this was an OK movie, they either did not see the one I did, or they can't feel. It is the summary of a man's life and it has nothing to do with occupation. It has to do with value.",10

It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",8
29 April 2015,I had an epiphany about this movie today,"And its Tea-Party roots.

Basically, this movie was a tool used to inject poison. I'll get to that in a bit.

This film was released at virtually the Nadir of some of the worst years, not of just my life, but of this nation.

If we look at the events surrounding the year of it's release: US is embroiled in basically a war which our then-president caused over OIL. The Housing bubble had burst, and one year later, Bush's first attempts to privatize our social security system was put into effect, namely ""Medicare Part D"" which privatized a function of Social Security, took it AWAY from the State, and handed it directly to private entrepreneurs and Insurance Sharks. Many of our elderly went without medication for up to three years. If Part D were put on the table today exactly as it was in 2004, it would be rejected, because it is supposed to be ""Federal"". The reason why this I bring this up is because it was an issue during the time this movie was being made, it's director and writer believes in it, and mainly this movie attacks the idea of Social Security.

So I watch this movie, and it actually did have some good things in it, ergo my 5 rating. For the first half at least, some of it was very good, because Chair-Talking' Clint actually is a talented director. But I thought I was watching a movie about a girl who liked Boxing and became a woman boxer. And it was interesting as that movie... Until Clint decides to speak to that empty chair for the first time.

Suddenly, the film is no longer about a budding girl boxer, suddenly she is disabled, and her ""evil"" mother is fighting with Clint over her money (The mother who just so happens to be worried about losing her Social Security benefits because she is given a HOUSE).

If a Disabled person, meaning a person dependent on Social Security to do things like get Medical Care, EAT, find transportation, etc (In other words, those things that people who are not disabled take for granted) - If suddenly were given a HOUSE like that, well for a fact there would be serious and instant consequences- They COULD lose their Social Security. Now, the mother is no angel, and has problems: But to be worried about losing Social Security is a dread fear for all people who get it. However, the woman did receive and act on bad advice from other family members. But Clint uses this one dysfunctional family to make all of Social Security look bad, attacking the recipients of it, in order to state his political views on not liking the system. Well, to hell with you, Clint! Basically, this film is a war about a girl's inheritance money - Should it be given to her Family, who does not seem to give a rip about the girl, or should her ""beloved"" trainer get it? The Problem is, regardless of how bad the mother appears, she was justified in being worried over losing her benefits. Simply put, Clint is not a valid person or director to put these elements into a movie, he's never had to LIVE on Social Security. Maybe at times he's had to get California Disability, but that's not the same thing- a person who is on Social Security can own a house, but to just be GIVEN a house is a serious problem.

Perhaps if Clint had not made such a big deal in the movie about the mother's fear of Losing Benefits, but it just seemed to me, he went out of his way to make it into some kind of ""statement"". I mean, if the mother is a B****, then just have her be a B****. The whole thing about fear of losing Benefits had no place in this film.

Now regarding the relationship Clint has with his Boxer played by Hilary Swank, I could believe that a bit. But that was at the very end of the movie, where his true feelings came out (He tells her what the Irish Slogan he had sewn on her robe meant). It would have been a better ending for a better movie had not Clint used the Anti-Medicare Detour to get there. Now, I've never read the stories that this is based upon, I don't know if the reactionary ideas were in the stories, or if Clint simply put them in. All I know is that this film uses those unfortunate events to make a system we depend on look bad.

But this is just Par for Eastwood Movies these days, he is no longer interested in making any good Drama, he actually used to make films that supported the underdog, lately he makes films to support radical right wing reactionary ideas. But mostly he creates these huge canvases where he basically justifies telling a lie as the truth, like his latest sniper movie which gives his stamp of approval to the War in Iraq. I'd rather see him stick to Fiction.",5
23 October 2005,Clint Eastwood has done it again,"Clint Eastwood has done it again, directing and acting in another memorable film. 'Million Dollar Baby' will surely tug at your heartstrings by the end and give you some deserving reflection on parts of your own life too. The story encompasses a lot of human endurance's and dwells on the path one takes in life; whether it is the right onewe will never know for sure. It centers on the hopes and dreams of 3 main characters; - Frankie Dunn, Maggie Fitzgerald and Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Each has their own story to tell and this is done bit by bit throughout the film. Hilary Swank was a wise choice to play the part of Maggie Fitzgerald she is so convincing as the aspiring boxer with stars in her eyes. She wants to better herself and accomplish something in her life before it's too lateher dream to be the best boxer she can be. Not easy with an unwilling trainer and no previous formal training, which makes it that much harder. Yes, I suppose you've guessed by now this film is about female boxing and yes again, it's that good!!! Before I watched it I had no idea what it was about, not an inkling of what to expect at all.

The 4 Oscar Awards absolutely deserved.everything concerning the production is excellent. Not to mention the acting.as always Morgan Freeman steals the limelight with his role of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris - the gym caretaker who adds warmth and humor to an otherwise lonely place. Quite different from Frankie where he shows sarcasm and less confidence, Eddie (Morgan) plays off this with such a natural acting ability. The two congeal their parts so perfectly and the dialogue exchange between the two is sharp and witty, you'll be snickering to yourself when you hear it.

'Million Dollar Baby' I think is a tremendous testimony of talent to one of today's most respected director/actor. Clint Eastwood has had a successful career behind the camera, he is (what I call) a thinking director  knows exactly how he wants his films done and simply does it. See it if you enjoyed watching the likes of 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull'.not exactly on the same level of masculinity, though with a lot more heart!!! 9/10",9
26 February 2005,Forget the nay-sayers - this is a great film!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

4 July 2005,Hillary Swank does it again!,"Hillary Swank never fails to surprise me in a movie. Her only fault as an actress is having been associated with ""Bevery Hills 90210"" because her acting talents are superb and not worthy of a mindless teenage series.

Clint Eastwood shines as her boxing manager as he is slowly transformed from a battle hardened trainer to a caring and loving individual. I think the chemistry between the two actors is on the money.

Morgan Freeman acting goes without saying since he can take on any role and give it life and character. I love his narrative skills from the days of ""Shawshank Redemption"".

This movie is great but you must be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster ride. It will tug at your heartstrings. The ending reveals Eastwood's true character.

2 July 2006,Hollywood Failure,"What a waste of talent, This movie did not only make me sick to the gut with its pathetic story line, it also bored me to endless tears to see two talented actors in such a dreary and unfufilling movie. My advice is for anyone that hasn't seen this movie and is thinking of watching it Don't BOTHER. This movie is not worth the film that is printed on. I would recommend If you decide to watch it that you have either a shotgun, so ounce the movie is finished, you can blow your brains out because after seeing a movie like this you will realise that Hollywood has finally come to a dreary end and they are making movies worse and worse every day.

11 April 2005,Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood walked together under a triumphal arch,"Very small amount before Maggie Fitzgerald succeeded, she defeated against life. I got upset till Scrap taught us that moving forward to target is more valuable than reaching target.

He did not philosophize for the situation. It was pure fact of life. I learned the theory well. On the other hand, putting into practice have quite a few problems. But all of can cope with them. Maggie Fitzgerald indicated it with gigantic way. Life, blessed life, let us broaden our horizon perpetually.

If the movie teach us the facts, then no need to have an academy award. We accept the value sooner or later, when we apply the clues into our life and see the following magic.

3 March 2005,Profound & Unforgettable,"My husband and I see a lot of movies and usually spend the drive home talking about what we thought. That's about all the discussion or thought we give to most of the movies we see. Not the case with Million Dollar Baby. I've had a hard time getting this one off of my mind. I went to sleep thinking about it, woke up thinking about it, and have recalled its emotions many times today.

I knew the movie was about an upcoming woman boxer and in fact it started out like an underdog ""Rocky""-type flick. Character development was perfection - you learned enough of the background to understand why each character became the person they were, but much was left unrevealed- some of which I'm still wondering about today.

The deep emotions of joy, triumph, & overcoming your past were balanced with enough sadness to be moved to tears. And questions were raised that are truly NOT black and white, regardless of your religious or ethical beliefs.

This movie left me sadder than most movies I've ever seen. I was moved in a way few movies have impacted me.

It's not a ""feel good"" movie, but it is a movie that will make you feel. Go and experience Million Dollar Baby. Go on a day you can handle some pain and sadness. It is worth your time & tears and you will be rewarded with outstanding performances from an amazing cast.",10

22 January 2005,Unbelievably good!,"Before I saw this film, I assumed it was going to be nothing but a feel good movie about a female boxer who ended up winning an important fight. I had no idea it would have such an effect on me. It was much more complex than I expected it to be with unpredictable twists and turns. All of the actors were great. Morgan Freeman deserves a best supporting actor win. I think Clint Eastwood should be nominated for best actor.

The film is comedic. The film is dramatic and tragic. Clint Eastwood's simple original musical score is very very good, too. This should be the best film of the year. It's almost perfect.

5 February 2005,Rocky: The Debbie Downer Version,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a lean, mean, fighting machine of a movie, pulling no punches and throwing no towels. It stars Clint Eastwood as a ringside ""cut man,"" Morgan Freeman as his gym manager buddy, and Hilary Swank as a struggling waitress who seeks glory in the sweet science.

I wish I could say I loved it. I think I liked it, because the acting is awesomely good and the story has its moments. It's a film with merit. But there are people in the world who like movies like this and ""Terms Of Endearment"" and ""Rocket Gibraltar"" because they like movies that make them feel. ""Million Dollar Baby"" made me feel, too, feel confused at what the dialogue was on screen in the latter part of the picture with all the sniffling in the theater.

Eastwood as a director has a definite style, one that complements his acting métier. Terse lines, acerbically delivered. Some laughs, preferably dry ones. Camera-work that tends to the dark and monochromatic. ""Million Dollar Baby"" as a story suits his direction well.

Eastwood as an actor has never let go the way he does here. He's awesome in several scenes, quietly breaking apart. He has to give it all he's got, though, because he's working opposite Hilary Swank, who just tears your heart out with those eyes, that big-toothed grin, and the way she delivers lines like ""You gotta do me a favor, boss."" There's a scene with her just sitting in a car, making eye contact with a little girl and her dog from across a gas pump, and that wordless scene is probably the best piece of acting in any film this year. Freeman is good, too, reading comic books and working on getting his friend to warm to the girl with the gloves.

The rest of the supporting cast is disappointingly one note. Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald has a trailer-trash family who wear their nastiness like tourist-trap T-shirts. No subtlety. There's a priest that glowers at Eastwood's Frankie Dunn and his wry questioning in such a way one wonders how he handles hearing confessions, and one nasty German boxing opponent who does everything short of don a swastika in the ring.

The story is kind of rote, too, all very montage and quickly edited to discourage deep thought. Just what does this boxer find in ""Boss"" Frankie to make her suddenly so powerful in the ring? I know, you say the power of love. But there has to be something more, and it's lightly explained.

So is the run for a boxing title, which is handled in a way that feels like Cliff Notes, with a series of one-punch knockouts from Fitzgerald that neither ring true nor set up the dramatic tension needed to propel the story past the rags-to-riches cliché. There's also some business with some characters around the gym, like a mentally retarded man who gets picked on, but it's so truncated with the focus on the Fitzgerald story it feels like the padding it no doubt is.

I think the main performances are so incredible, they carry the rest of the film with them. In time, though, people may not be as wowed with ""Million Dollar Baby"" as they are now.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is good, solid entertainment through the first two thirds, then takes a very challenging turn that probably cost it some admirers. It's very engaging, and then it tears you up, and you will carry the experience of seeing the film for a long time, longer than maybe you want to. You can't fault a film for making you sad, or for being manipulative. But I think the films that endure are the ones that don't forcefeed you with emotions the way you are fed them here.",6
10 March 2005,Straight from the heart,"A love story of uncommon beauty, written with daring simplicity, acted with unflinching honesty by each and every player in it, directed by a master storyteller.

No question about its being a tough experience to watch, but this film has many pleasures, not the least of which is the depth of love and joy expressed by the main characters, despite the heartbreaking challenges they must face. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman are tuned to the same devastating emotional string--that Eastwood delivers such a performance while also directing the picture is nothing short of an artistic miracle.

The film is aptly named, its title reminds us of an old song which plays in our hearts and minds long after the movie is done.

5 February 2012,Once you finish it you will know that you have watched one of the greatest movies,"When you say that a movie is beautiful, most of time what comes straightly to your mind can be a romantic movie filled lovely people and a happy ending. But in a very strange way this hardcore dramatic boxing flick redefine the beautiful movie perception. It speaks of determination, courage, and the sweet taste of conquering dreams and the most hurtful bitterness of defeat. Yet all this mixed up so well that once you finish it you will know that you have watched one of the greatest movies you will ever see while you're alive. Gracias to Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank for their creativity and for working the miracle.

8 August 2022,Top performance by Eastwood,"Lint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Unforgiven."" His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to ""Million Dollar Baby."" The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love ""Scrap."" Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from ""Closer"" definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection. Its dark lighting gave the exact mood of each scene and beautiful musical score is remarkable. He is truly one of the most gifted people in Hollywood.",7
26 October 2006,"my darling, my blood","The characters are tough both in appearance and thought, but that's not the way to decide about who they really are. Boxing has made them so. The simple rule: always protect yourself. Boxing is life and life is boxing. You hit somebody or somebody may hit you. You may run from your past or you may have nothing to lose. You may even lose your eye, but you are still in the world of boxing, exactly as you are still alive.

The film is delicate in its own unique ways. It is about courage, heart, hope, and fear. Fear from the past and from the future.

You have to go to the end to find out you are somebody's or many people's darling and blood.

14 July 2020,Not your typical boxing movie,"When I first started this movie. I thought it was going to be the typical boxing movie. Main lead gets called out by the bad guy, there is this huge training montage, then the final big fight. But I am so glad it was nothing like that. Its actually completely different. The performances are pretty great. I especially liked the bond between Maggie and Frankie.

12 January 2006,Not Just Boxing,"For those people who do not like boxing (such as me) take heart. It might not matter. In my opinion this movie transcends boxing, just as the movie Sea Biscuit was not just a horse race movie.

I have heard it said that when Clint Eastwood directs a film and is also a star in it, it will be a notch above most in seriousness and overall quality. Having added this one more Clint Eastwood picture to my viewing experience I have to agree. Clint Eastwood is definitely an interesting person. With no one to direct him but himself, he turns in a fabulous performance as an actor in this movie. Perhaps due to casting, perhaps due to Eastwood's direction and perhaps due to both, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman also deliver acting performances that were among the best I have seen anywhere. With this realistic acting, serious direction, and an interesting story line, Million Dollar Baby is easily one of the most powerful movies I can recall seeing in recent years. Powerful is the correct word. With both exceptional and yet believable roles played by Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood himself, one can easily get lost into the movie themselves seeing it through one of their eyes, and thus almost become a part of the film itself.

I know that some will try to typecast this movie and pigeonhole it as a certain type. Some will call it a boxing movie. Some will say it is a pro euthanasia movie. Now, I also believe that I am a moral person. However, to typecast this movie as simply as either of those I believe is to be unfair to Eastwood. Eastwood does not take the subject of boxing too seriously, and yet he more than does enough to render the subject of life and death itself a most serious matter in this movie also. In fact, after watching this movie, one wonders if Clint Eastwood is capable of being ""casual"" about anything. Clint Eastwood is a serious director, a serious actor, and a serious man.

I highly recommend watching this movie. However I would also caution what I say is its most important point - that of being a powerful movie. By powerful movie you may, as I was, become drawn deep into the movie and the story. When that happens you might want to cheer at the times when it has good news, and be very sad during the movie sad parts. That is what I believe powerful means.

I recommend this movie and am personally looking forward to the next Clint Eastwood production.",9
10 February 2005,"First-class, first-rate, movie MAGIC.","An absolute masterpiece. Million Dollar Baby is an exemplary movie experience, commendable in every way. Seeing this film once, is definitely not enough. Hilary Swank gives a magnificent performance as an aspiring female boxer with a heart of gold. Clint Eastwood is outstanding as the grief-stricken boxing trainer, who reluctantly takes a chance on the zealous 31year old. Morgan Freeman is resplendent in his role, as a gym maintenance-man, who quietly observes his surroundings with a keen and intelligent eye. The supporting cast also deserve credit for their solid performances. Masterfully, directed by Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby is truly 'one in a million'.

14 February 2005,The best film in a year of wonderful films.,"Million Dollar Baby is the best picture of the year through and through. After taking the history of motion pictures last semester, I somehow decided that I was going to reject the mannered style of classical Hollywood cinema such as Howard Hawkes and Frank Capra, where style and montage are subordinate to narrative. Despite this, I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with this film from the first frame until the last. Clint Eastwood has an eye for film-making and directing that is worthy of all accolades, including the Oscars. If there is any justice, Clint will walk away with his second best director trophy, well deserved over Martin Scorsese (who also directed a good film. Just not as good, and noticeably not as good.) Million Dollar Baby follows the rise of underdog boxer Maggie Fitzgerald, in a flawless performance by Hilary Swank who has proved that her turn in 1999's Boys Don't Cry wasn't a fluke. She too will take home her second Oscar, also well deserved over her ""overdue"" competition who will remain nameless. Maggie is too old to start training, too inexperienced to fight and too dumb to realize it. The film centers around her relationship with hardened fighter-turned-trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who approaches her with steadfast reluctance that believably morphs into a paternal love that words can hardly describe. Eastwood too gives a wonderful performance as Maggie's trainer/surrogate father whose troubled relationship with his own daughter leaves a void that Maggie fills with her unwavering loyalty.

Possibly even more wonderful than Eastwood and Swank is the film's narrator, Scrap played by the ever-lauded, yet still Oscar-less Morgan Freeman. His performance is on-point, consistent and almost effortless, as he narrates this tale with haunting grace. If this performance doesn't garner Freeman an Oscar, then there truly is no justice in the academy.

To say that this film switches gears some two-thirds of the way through is redundant and pointless at this point, considering the press the film has received. I won't specifically divulge what that twist is because it isn't my place. Yes, this movie is at its heart, about far more than just boxing. The fact that this movie is getting some bad press from right-wing media, wasn't the most Oscar nominated film (Scorsese's the Aviator got the most noms) and lost the Producer's Guild award will logically keep Million Dollar Baby from stealing the best picture trophy from the Aviator. However, like Hilary Swank's Maggie, I believe that Million Dollar Baby, with the odds stacked against it, will rise above all obstacles and take home Oscars for best picture, director, actress and supporting actor. Clint has truly pushed himself to earn his best director and best picture trophies this time around. While it would be great to see Scorsese finally take home an Oscar (it's a travesty that he doesn't have one by now), the general consensus is that it's Clint who deserves it and I'd be loath to disagree.",
29 April 2022,Eastwood at the top of his game,"A heartfelt portrait of the bond between a sun-setting boxing manager and his upstart apprentice, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is equal parts hopeful and energizing, and absolutely soul-crushing. I can say without exaggeration that this film wrecked me, and yet I cannot recommend it highly enough. Though the punches are gloved, this isn't really about boxing at all. This is a human drama, one-hundred percent, and the movie's all the better for it.

This is the story of a young woman who knows her place in life is at the bottom and refuses to accept it. Her way out of poverty, physical weakness, and a wretched family is the boxing championship, and she fights harder than everyone around her to get there. I honestly feel that Maggie is the root of my love of strong female characters; she made a mark on me in 2004 and I haven't been able to shake it (would I really want to?). As incredible as Eastwood and Freeman are in this film, Hilary Swank personifies its heart and soul. She is on a whole different level here.

Everything here, from the casting to performances and direction are handled with great care; and no matter how shocking this film may be, it never comes off as cheap or manipulative. Quite the opposite, I think this is one of the most moving films I have ever seen.",9
2 May 2006,Million Dollar Tears from this one,"This is without a doubt Eastwood's best ever movie. From start to finish we see how one man can and will be able to make a difference in someone's life when they need them the most. As a martial artist I've always believed that the teacher appears when the student is ready, and never is this more apparent than with Swank's character.

I related to her in this, as I saw her family issues arise from her career success and the jealousy which can go with it. I also have to say it gives me tears every time I've watched it, and I simply refuse to see the end of it anymore. Its that good, its that powerful.

So if you're looking for a good movie, no, make that an awesome one, this is one to get. I rank it up there with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Love it, simply love it.

5 February 2005,It's Still a Boxing Movie,"I hate boxing. The only thing I hate more than boxing is movies about boxing. The only reason I went to see Million Dollar Baby was that it was the only one of the Best Picture nominees that I hadn't seen and there was nothing else playing.

The good news is that for a boxing movie, it is first rate. It ranks up there with Requiem for a Heavyweight and Raging Bull. The technical quality is great. It has a decent script, good acting, and a surprisingly atmospheric soundtrack.

Film critic Roger Ebert defended this movie by saying it not about boxing, it is about people. While that is true to a point, a lot of this film is about boxing and a large chunk of this film shows people boxing. The first 2/3 of the film is almost like Rocky except the acting and dialog is much better. The professional film critics have all agreed not to talk about the last third of the film except to say ""it takes a dark turn."" If you don't like depressing films, you should skip this one.

Overall, I gave this film a 8/10 rating. It's really good but it's a downer and it's a boxing movie.",8
6 February 2005,Oh boy.,"Left this movie about 2 hours ago. Am still somewhat...numb? I don't know what exactly it is I do feel. I really don't want to dissect it all tonight. I just know I have been very affected by this simple, beautiful film.

In the movie, there were a few times I just felt like sobbing; and not only in the last 1/2 hour or at the ""sad"" parts. Just some deep feelings these fine actors, with this little story, brought out of some deep place inside me.

I stayed away from reviews and talk of this film so I did not know what was going to happen. Boy was I surprised by the ending segment; taken back at first and then wasn't quite sure where we were going in the last scenes. Surely she was going to fight her way back? When I saw what was going to happen, I initially rejected that outcome. Then, after awhile, I understood that this was the place this movie was going to all along, and it became something so much more than what it started out to be.

There are some movies that really touch the heart. This was one.

Hilary Swank you are incredible.",10
29 April 2022,"My first Boxing movie, and it's amazing","This movie's amazing and sad at the end and I completely see why this movie got best picture in 2005 and why Elizabeth Swank got best actress. I'm still processing the movie but this movie is great.

6 February 2008,Girls don't fight,"I recently read the late F.X. Toole's only novel, 'Pound for Pound'; but watch 'Million Dollar Baby', derived from an earlier short story of Toole's, and you enter exactly the same world, that of seedy gyms occupied by old men for whom life is boxing, and boxing is life. The twist in this tale is that the central boxer is a woman; although the meaning of title eventually becomes apparent in a way you don't at first suspect. However, I found the film a little short on back story, the lead male characters (played by director Clint Eastwood, and fellow veteran Morgan Freeman) seem weary without explanation; sighing, which both are good at, is not in itself a sign of profundity. And rather as it did in 'The Shawshank Redemption', Morgan's narration softens the movie, which in fact is surprisingly unvisceral for a story about fighting. Likewise, the issue of how a woman finds social acceptance as a boxer is skirted; Hilary Swank's character feels more at home here than she does anywhere else, although we learn nothing of how she came to discover that boxing was her thing. Of course, in many ways, this film is better for not being 'Rocky'; but I still wonder, did it have to be quite so low-key?",6
25 January 2005,A Triumph for 74 year old Director and Star......CLINT EASTWOOD,"Take a sports drama and litter it with every cliché in the book then let the great Clint Eastwood surprise the audience as he manages to deliver a highly satisfying, original, thought provoking film. Despite containing some of the most realistic fight sequences I've seen, this is not a film about boxing, it's about loneliness, redemption and achievement, something that brings together three characters played by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.

Eastwood displays his emotional side something he touched upon in UNFORGIVEN, IN THE LINE OF FIRE & BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, but here he excels in one of the most moving performance's of his career, he directs with pace and flair but never over indulges with style. He also composed the beautiful score, a talent many movie fans don't know about(he also wrote the theme alongside regular collaborator Lennie Niehaus for UNFORGIVEN).

Freeman is excellent (as usual) in a role not too dissimilar to that in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and let's not forget the lovely MILLION DOLLAR BABY herself Hilary Swank, she gained an Oscar five years ago for BOYS DON'T CRY but never achieved star status...hopefully this movie will change that.

This is as good as mainstream Hollywood can get and Legend Eastwood doesn't need big budgets to please a Cinema audience and with his 75th birthday in May approaching he shows no signs of stopping.",
5 April 2005,I loved this movie!,"I saw Million Dollar Baby last weekend, and I was very surprised. I expected a movie about boxing to be a tad boring, but since it won Best Picture, I decided to see it. The acting was amazing, and Hilary Swank's character was so believable! I laughed and cried throughout the movie...and the story of the young woman's life was so incredible I wasn't surprised of the great reviews it received. I want to sob just thinking about it! I of course had to tell all my friends about it, and now we all want to see it together. I can't describe how touching this movie was, and I know that sounds cheesy, but it's really true. It seemed to make me forget everything going on in my hectic life for just long enough to indulge in the rare and beautiful story of a poor woman with nothing but hope and determination to be the best she can. Her innocence and sweetness adds so much to the plot. Also, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are awesome.. I recommend this movie to anyone, just have a box of tissues ready!

24 October 2005,A very good work.,"In general, I like Clint Eastwood's films. Million dollar baby is a sincere and realistic work. There is a small, strange story with two strange people. A boxing coach with such dedication and a soft soul covered by ruggedness, and a girl with such determination to become a champion. The story becomes unique with the characterizations of Dunn and Maggie. There are bad people in the story but they are not purposefully exposed to be 'villainous'. Her mom and sister were not that much loving as a normal poor family with a bad/dead daddy and living in bad surroundings expect to be.

The main good thing is the story line and the script; both of them with sincerity and dedication. Next ones are the acting, music and photography and in fact direction of Clint. I wondered about Clint Eastwood's music. It was very simple. I don't know it involved any mind boggling composing of tunes. It was just plain but it was more than enough. In this modern world with readily perverted, what-the-heck kind of minds, this kind of plain good simple-natured story and characters might look odd. It did (that is why these Oscars I guess). I loved this film. It's like a perfect little short story (of two hours time though). Many criticizing comments read Morgan Freeman has nothing to play. But as I see it, Freeman adds more depth into the story. Watch it if you can go with slow-moving but strong stories.",8
1 April 2022,Touching. Witty. Gripping. Brilliant.,"I must confess that I love this movie, but I dont watch it very often, because I always get really sad and emotional when watching this movie. So if you are in the mood for a really (good) tearjerker, with the best acting performances, with a sublime direction, beautiful photography and a story that will touch you deeply, then this is your pick.

Not any bad? The build up of this movies heart and soul is carried out in a slowburning, tranquil manner. Dont expect fireworks (emotional) from the start, but you will get overwhelmed with emotions at the very end. As it is suppose to be, in a really brilliant drama!

2 February 2005,Is everyone on CRACK??!!,"Even though there are pages upon pages of comments, I just had to leave one myself because I didn't care much for this movie. And I really wanted to voice my opinion on it.

The main issue that I have with ""Million Dollar Baby"" is probably that there is absolutely no attempt to entertain. Instead, it just drones on (monotone voice-over included!) and there are too many elements of the real, i.e. non-victorious ending, that it just got incredibly BORING for me. ""Old Yeller"" w/ boxing, that's all I have to say!

Maybe that's the point, to mimic something real. But what was up to the letters to the daughter? Or that retarded guy who hung out at the gym everyday? Swank was believable as an underdog boxer who just wanted a chance and would stop at nothing to get it. Eastwood, okay...but a bit wooden, never truly ""breaks down"" like I thought he would. Freeman, I didn't really understand anything he was saying.

AM I MISSING SOMETHING??!! Or is everyone else on CRACK??!!

19 April 2005,Deserved Oscar Winner..,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9

8 February 2005,And the winner by a knockout...MILLION DOLLAR BABY,"Hot new prospect Million Dollar Baby electrified the crowds and sent out an ominous warning to other contenders with a sensational knockout in the later rounds here last night. Having set the pace from the first round, the up and coming champion remained aggressive until the final four rounds where she dazzled her fans with one of the greatest displays of skill not seen since the days of Raging Bull. With consummate skill Million Dollar Baby changed tactics in the later rounds, a strategy devised by her trainer Clint Eastwood. It was a move nobody at ringside saw coming, and as one critic stated, it was in the final third act that Million Dollar Baby stepped into masterpiece territory. The performance, considered by many as the best of the year, was more than enough to guarantee a shot at the World Title on February 27th. Hailing from Malpaso Boxing Gym, where under the tutelage of veteran trainer Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby has become one of the hottest contenders around. In fact, many critics and pundits believe that Eastwood, one of the most respected men in the business, will have himself another world champion come fight night at the Oscars, his first being Unforgiven who was title holder in 1993.",9
10 July 2018,Great performances all around,"Hilary Swank didn't annoy me as much as she usually does, so Million Dollar Baby must have been a good movie. However, it didn't emotionally engage me as much as I thought it would and I kept looking at the clock - which is never a good sign. Great performances all around, but I think there were a couple other films in 2004 that were more deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture.

29 July 2005,One Jaded Soul that was Touched,"Maybe I've been a movie-goer for far too long, but I'd still like to think that every now and again it's possible to reach me. We've all been there as writers and directors try to reach out and tug on our collective heart strings. They give us tales of heart ache and woe, stories that are meant to capture out emotions and leave us feeling exactly as their protagonist does. Sometimes it works, most times it comes off as it was done, trite and meaningless.

I say all of this, because as a jaded movie-buff, Million Dollar Baby is easily one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. Forgetting about the politics of the film or the inherent criticisms that would follow, I felt that the story was so much more human than any I'd seen in a very long time. I want to say more, but really, how could I? The movie stands head and shoulders above all else by its own merits. Do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",

21 September 2010,"Sports fan or not, check this film out","This is one of the best boxing movies every made, heck it's one of the best sports movie I ever seen. The acting, the plot, the cinematography, almost everything was done really great and it got my attention from beginning to end. I especially loved watching the humanism in this movie and all the emotions, because the acting is just top notch. This is a story about a poor southern girl who wants to enter the boxing world and with hard work gets her coach played by Clint Eastwood who becomes her mentor and becomes a father figure, kinda like the only family she ever had. And as time goes by her game and skill improves. It's inspiring and yet depressing film that is most definitely a classic. Didn't even know of Hilary Swank but she puts on a amazing performance and she is going to go far in the movie industry, this movie is so good it basically made her. It really is a memorable film that is most definitely worth checking out, sports fan or not.

22 October 2006,What?! No Nudity?!,"I finally had an opportunity to view this incredible gem of a movie and now know what all the positive buzz was about. It's so refreshing to see a film built on story and acting actually win the Best Picture Oscar. It's even more gratifying to see Hollywood, the ultimate Land of Youth, honor a seventy-something year old director. And what a bargain. At the cost of a mere $18 million you know right up front that money wasn't thrown at it to make it more appealing to today's typically shallow movie going public. Usually the first 20 million or so goes directly into lining the pockets of some lousy, over-rated star who's supposed to supersede actual creativity in order to guarantee a decent box office crowd. I'd love to shake the hand of the gutsy Hollywood execs who green-lighted this one. Some of the best decision making Tinsletown has ever seen. No gun play, no fireballs, no CGI showboating and NO NUDITY. Not even nudity ""intregal to the plot line!"" and yet it actually succeeded in creatively topping every other film of 2004. How's THAT for bucking established trends? Here's to hoping that more films follow form now that there's proof that substance does mean something after all. So if you haven't yet seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", give it a shot. Wonderful, wonderful stuff sans all those trappings that have kept me out of first run theaters for the better part of two decades now. Sometimes they DO make'em like they used to. Enjoy!",9
25 January 2005,A Classic,"The title is deceptive. It could be a Betty Grable picture - it once was a Priscilla Lane/Ronnie Regan movie - or a piece of show-biz hype about triumph over adversity. In fact, for it's first half that is exactly what it is and if the plot seems formulaic, Eastwood imbues it with such a feeling for character and milieu that cliché is the last thing you are likely to think of. Then about mid-way it takes a darker turn. Guilt and redemption come to the fore and the up-beat triumphalism of what has gone before is jettisoned in favor of another of Eastwood's bleak studies of the American malaise. Not a bad thing given his skill in handling this kind of material, though you may come away from the film admiring it rather more than you actually like it.

As a director Eastwood has never been one to blind you with technique; this is an old-fashioned movie in the very best sense. The performances and the script drive it and even when it's at it's most austere the closest Eastwood comes to being 'cinematic' is a series of slow dissolves to blackness. And those performances are very fine indeed. If Hilary Swank fits her part of the trailer-trash hick who wants to be a boxer like the proverbial glove she, nevertheless, seems to find shadings and depth in her character that lifts her out of the ordinary.

Morgan Freeman, virtually monosyllabic as an aging ex-boxer, conveys more with a look than most actors could do with a barrage of words. He is so much in character here that even his clothes seem to fit him like a second skin. But ultimately the film belongs to Eastwood in every sense. As a director he has developed a classic style that is the very antithesis of what modern movies are about; as an actor he has learned how to inhabit the character he plays with effortless skill. His performance here may well be the best thing he has done on screen, certainly on par with his William Munny in ""Unforgiven"" and this dark, sad, forgiving film bears mention in the same breath as both ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""Mystic River"".",8
5 November 2022,Still amazing after nearly twenty years,"Saw this on a list of great movies and although I'd seen it when it was released I thought I'd give it another go.

Wasn't disappointed.

Everything in this movie shines.

I remember at the time of release there was a lot of praise for Hillary Swank and the amount of training she'd put in to add credibility to the character. She plays this role to perfection. It would have been so easy to fall short of playing this role because of the technical and fitness requirements but it was only after the film finished that I even thought about it. Totally seamless.

Another great aspect of this film is the greed of the main characters family. Another aspect that could have jarred but didn't.

I suppose Clint Eastwood and Malpaso were just a film making machine at this point in time and this film is a master class. Every scene is treated with great consideration and extensive experience in what works for audiences.",9
21 July 2005,Earns a million stars!,"I do not know how to begin praising this movie. The plot was amazing and it goes very deep. The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing, but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character, Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life, and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie cliché, I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.

The acting was amazing. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman work so well together, and I had no reason to be displeased with how they acted out their roles.

Warning: If you have not yet watched the movie, do not read the next paragraph. It will ruin the ending for you!!

The only part of the movie which confused me was when Frankie pulls the cord. Isn't this illegal and immoral to some people? I'm not sure if he should have done this. The movie was really good so I'm not going to dwell on this. It's just that he developed such a fatherly relationship with Maggie and it's kind of odd to see him make the choice he makes. Anyway, the movie earns about a million stars from me, but since I can only give it 10, I guess that will do.",10
25 January 2005,excellent work!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

15 January 2005,Wonderfully Brilliant Surprising Masterpiece,"To be honest, when I first heard about this movie and that it was Mr. Eastwood's next film venture, I was a bit skeptical. Even though I am a die-hard Clint Eastwood fan, even giving my son the middle name Eastwood, it sounded like a boring story and not up my idol's alley. Then of course, after watching the trailer, I became intrigued and then of course, after all the critical praise, became intent on seeing it soon. Trouble was, it was only playing at one theater in my area and a good thirty miles from home. Tonight, I decided to make the trip and boy my efforts paid off. This film starts out to be a great story and sweet, funny and visually stunning and then once it starts to reach it's climax, changes gears and goes another direction. I won't tell you where it heads, but suffice it say, this film was just marvelous. Also, be prepared, that if some films tug at your heart strings, it may be worthwhile to take some tissues with you. Just do whatever you can to see this movie, you'll be glad you did. Bravo Clint, All The Very Best And Many Years To Come.

25 July 2020,One of the best films I've seen in recent times. I recommend!,"I was truly impressed with this film. It is one of the most impressive and intense that I have seen in a while and I believe that it couldn't have had any other destiny than winning the Oscar for Best Motion Picture, in that distant year of 2005. Its also, for me and until now, the best film by Clint Eastwood, where he not only plays one of the most important and complex roles, but also directs. Remarkable!

The film is basically about a young girl from very modest backgrounds who finds her life's course in boxing. The problem is that she is a woman, and all boxing academies reject her because of that. However, she will be able to capture the attention of two coaches, former retired boxers, who accept the task of training and teaching her, each of whom has a past linked to boxing and very complex personal lives. To knew more, its best to see the film, its worth every minute.

Clint Eastwood is the man here. He had already proven himself to be a great actor and great director, that wasn't new when he released this film, but it is difficult to conceive of something that can be even better than this. Eastwood's skilful hand and attentive and detailed style are everywhere and earned him the Oscar for Best Director that year, with all merit and fairness. The script, based on tales by F.X. Toole, was written by Paul Haggis and is excellent. And here I think Eastwood took a chance, given that Haggis had made a career as a screenwriter more associated with television than cinema. But the risk was well rewarded, and the proof is Haggis' collaboration on several Eastwood films from then on.

The cast is not very large and that is a good thing, as it gave the actors time and space to shine. The star is Clint Eastwood, who plays a tough guy with feelings and an unresolved past. Next to her is Hillary Swank, a young actress full of personality and who had already shone in ""The Next Karate Kid"", also in a female action character. She was impressive and reached here one of the pinnacles of her career, winning the Oscar for Best Actress for the second time, which is always impressive for an actor. Another actor who deserves a note in this film, and who managed to collect the Oscar for Best Secondary Actor, is the impeccable and already veteran Morgan Freeman. However, and despite being a great actor, this was the only award that the Hollywood Academy has given him so far.

Technically it is an impeccable film. Cinematography provides us with excellent footage and a masterful use of colour, shadow and contrast to express and amplify feelings and moods. The sets and costumes are excellent. The sound effects and soundtrack, very discreet, fulfil their function with merit but without taking our attention away from the story told. The post-production work was also done with care and attention.

Anyone who says that this film is just a boxing film is totally wrong and made a reductive reading of this film. Its a film based on boxing, but it goes far beyond that, offering us much more: a story of poverty, ambition, greed; a story of dreams that are gradually crushed, punch by punch, by the harshness of life and reality; a story about pain, death and loss, in which highly pertinent and debatable moral questions are raised.",10

12 July 2017,Another Clint Eastwood hit!,"Director Clint Eastwood never ceases to impress. This film was outstanding!

Add to the fact that Clint Eastwood also stars in this, it's just a huge bonus. I wasn't sure of Hilary Swank's performance, but she too was a hit. Of course Morgan Freeman and Jay Baruchel played their parts great.

The writing was top notch and although the trailer does not make this film appealing, it really is, and it's a must see.

A 9/10 from me!

27 July 2005,One of the most deserving Oscar winners in years...,"A few years back, I came to the conclusion that if you really want to know how great a movie is, have someone tell you the ending... if you watch it and are still enthralled by it, then it's probably pretty good. It's an unfortunate test really, because I love suspense in movies, but quiet true. It began when I first saw Apollo 13. I knew the history, yet i still sat on the edge of my seat, stupidly holding my breath, wondering if the crew would survive re-entry. Now a number of people told me how Million Dollar Baby ended, and dare I say it made the movie better in someways.

Eastwood creates some of the most human and endearing characters ever produced on film. I feel in love with every single one and simply found myself hoping everyone had lied to me. That somehow my copy of the film would be different... it was not. This is a touching and perfect film. Mr. Eastwood, the director, creates his most artful and technically skilled film yet, cementing himself among the great directors of all time. Swank has become the best/least known actresses in the history of film. An actress with the ability to become her role. All this is guided by the smooth voice of Freeman, making for 2 of the best hours film has produced in the past few years.

A beautiful film.",10
20 March 2006,"Freeman, Eastwood, and Swank Shine Eternal","Freeman, Eastwood, and Swank create legendary performances while creating a legend - fictitious, yes, but the heart shines through.

This film is by any measure controversial. I won't include spoilers for two reasons: 1) to induce those who haven't seen this elegiac masterpiece, and 2) to let those new to the film experience the grace of humanity, and the proximity of G*d - divinity - the great beyond.

Eastwood runs a failing gym, out of heart, out of hope for his last prize fighter who has a valid chance at a title - something that Eastwood never obtained in his long career as a brilliant manager cum cut-man.

The gym is replete with lost souls, those who had a chance, those that delude a title shot, and those with hearts to small to fight for glory despite innate talent.

Swank enters the gym, tips from her waitressing job buy her time in the gym, and she has a dream of becoming the top pugilist in her division. She scraps steak from her job, she admits her heritage of growing up ""white trash"" - she speaks of the defeat that overcame her family - but her heart swells, and in every step, or elusive blow to the hanging bag - her heart beats victory.

Eastwood becomes her reluctant trainer and delegable father - his own daughter not being on speaking terms - why, the audience is never informed - but Eastwood clings that each letter he sends won't be returned from his daughter like the hundred others that he keeps as punishment.

One would guess that Eastwood sins were great - that he betrayed his daughter - that he left his wife, that he is looking through redemption through the victory of his protégés.

In a word, this film chronicles Swank's rise from ""trailor trash"" to the fierce warrior who destroys her competition to the cheers, and inspired crowds chanting her Gaelic name, given to her by the poetry reading Eastwood.

Swank has her chance, and victory is certain. Eastwood has borough a fighter to the height of heart and skill. But this is not a glorified female version of Rocky, or more recently Cinderalla man. It is a story of friendship, loyalty, and again, like Mystic River, like Unforgiven, the tragic hand of G*d intervening to force the characters to face themselves at the level of heart, of Philos, of the knowledge of one's limits of love and devotion.

These themes prevail Eastwood's recent films, and his touch is delicate, and subcutaneous. To insert a personal anecdote - I sat in the theater long after the final frames had run, and the theater became lit, and emptied. Stunned that wisdom could be brought to the screen like the best of literature, floating like the best of Chopin's Nocturne's. This is a film for the ages. And will be talked about, and written about and discussed, for years to come.

The best film of the year, from one of Hollywood's most understated, and underrated directors - the masterfully wise Mr. Eastwood.",10
26 January 2005,Conservative mythologies,"MILLION DOLLAR BABY is Clint Eastwood's bode and homage to the world of traditional conservative values of the poor pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the tough-love authoritarian father figure, and the stereotype hatred of poor white trash welfare chiselers. In many of Eastwood's films, the former mayor of Carmel puts forward a world of simplistic virtue and moralistic black and white that you often see old men in diners declaim as lost to sophistry and complexity.

In MDB Eastwood's characters all verge on flat one-dimensional stereotypes, Morgan Freeman (puts in a good performance that defies its shallowness on paper) plays the washed-up boxer who lives in the storage closet of the gym. Hillary Swank is a desperate waitress who tries to escape grinding poverty and trailer trash ignorance by looking for a strong father-like authoritarian who, at first, attempts to disabuse her of foolish ambitions. The worse one-dimensional stereotypes come from Eastwoods depiction of Maggies family of crooks and overweight baby-producing welfare cheats.

The cartoon-like script treatment of the characters throws you out of the film's narrative and do not serve the excellent acting by Swank and Freeman. This is carefully contrived political ideology that ends with the well-worn emotional manipulation verging on melodrama. Eastwood would do better if he stuck to good storytelling and avoid broad swipes at political characterization.",
18 September 2006,What a wonderfully moving film,"Although, I haven't seen the other 4 films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 2004, Clint Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"" was certainly a worthy winner. Beautifully written, acted and filmed, this is the sort of film you have to sit back and experience. It is a mature and realistic story that seems so original and interesting that you can't help but admire those involved with it.

As far as boxing films are concerned this is definitely on par with Rocky and Raging Bull- possibly the two most memorable ones of the genre for the last 30 years. They each tell a different story that works in its one way.

Eastwood, Swank, Freeman and the rest of the supporting cast are outstanding and Paul Haggis' script contains plenty of memorable scenes between the characters and you really do get more and more involved as the story progresses.

I urge you to see this moving film whenever you get the chance.

21 February 2005,Bring some Kleenex,"I walked in with high expectations, although I am not a boxing fan, but it didn't matter....the story is eloquently told and masterfully depicted. Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and last but certainly not least...Hillary Swank. I felt like I was ringside; hearing, feeling and impacting each element of the story. It was an education in itself at how moving cinema can be and how much trust it takes to immerse oneself and walk out totally satisfied that movies are still worth the money. Speaking and relaying thoughts without words is incredibly and masterfully done here. And for the viewer, this technique in cinema enables us to be drawn into the action, not just a spectator! THANK YOU - - to everyone involved in this heart crushing but worthy story.

7 December 2015,A true sports drama masterpiece!,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a sports boxing real human life portrayed Drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.

Million Dollar Baby (2004) is Clint Eastwood's true masterpiece and one of his best movies and touching performances I have ever seen. This movie is million miles way better than the new movie Creed (2015)!! Creed (2015) hides from this movie! Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multiaward-winning tale of heart, hope and family. This is the real sports boxing drama portrayed about human young woman's life been a boxer. A lot of people disagree with me for not liking Gran Torino Clint Eastwood's overrated movie and does not accept that I love this movie. Beside Rocky and Southpaw is my third favorite best sports drama boxing movie. I just love this movie to death, I love it so much. This film is touching, powerful, incredible movie with amazing, amazing performances from Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank. Clint Eastwood sure did a great well excellent direction on this movie. This is my favorite best Clint Eastwood movie and no one can tell me not liking it, like Gran Torino that movie is better, in my opinion is not. Million Dollar Baby is the best human boxing drama life portrayed in a film ever!

Million Dollar Baby is about an under-appreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional. This movie isn't just about fighting and boxing matches it is about a bond, friendship and true love for sport. The chemistry between Clint and Hilary was awesome and masterful done, they both make a connection bond between father and daughter. Maggie Fitzgerald never had a father, while Frankie Dunn never had a daughter before. The underdog tale about young girl's life ids astonish telling, but the film isn't only about her. It is a about grief Frankie did a big mistake in the past and he does not want to repeat again. Morgan Freeman did awesome performance as retired boxer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant.

Great story with good action and well mix of emotion. One of the best movies but saddest movies I've ever seen I love boxing there's a few boring bits but overall great movie well done. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Hilary Swank provide a storyline much deeper than simply the world of women's boxing. Another Directing delight from Clint Eastwood !! What more can I say? Just amazing. Humor, photography, acting - all exemplary. The music was rather repetitive though. It holds up well over the years. Loved the way the relationships were drawn. I think Million Dollar Baby is the Best Movie in the world I think this Movie is for the older crowd Awesome movie by the Way. Another score for Hilary Swank (best actress for the second time)! Excellent movie all the way around, superb acting from all the cast. If you haven't seen it and think it's just a ""boxing"" movie then you're really missing out. it's much more about the characters and their relationships, past and present. Very powerful movie. Highly recommended!

Hilary Swank did the best job in the world playing Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer, I seriously love the actress. She was my first true crush love since I saw her in a TV movie Dying to Belong (1997) wen she was so damn sexy and hot and her previous movie The Next Karate Kid (1994). This is dramatic filmmaking at its finest. Eastwood paints a realistic, down-to-earth dramatic picture with this film. The trio of stars (including Eastwood himself) gives the performances of their careers - no one is overacting or winking at the camera.

The most what I love is how we find more about Maggie's life. What I never saw in any movie beside Rocky what can happen to a boxer if he get's permanently damaged. The fights in this movie are realistic in the last fight when Maggie gets a deadly shot by her opponent in her blind side and lands on her head on the corner stool, breaking her neck and than suffers spinal neck injury that leaves her paralyzed for life. That was real, everything is real! I never saw that you can get paralyzed from fighting for life! The last 1/4 of the movie is about euthanasia and human morals. Maggie is bedridden for a long time and eventually has to have her leg amputated due to bed sores turning gangrenous. That scene really remind on my mother when she was lining in the hospital and the doctors amputated her leg. I love how Maggie stick up for her self once in her life when her mother and her sister tried to ripped her off and squeeze her out off her money. All her family was ever caring was just money not their daughter/sister's health and life. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.

Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, and starring Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.

30 January 2005,"Magnificent, Eastwood's greatest achievement","With modest expectations I went into the theater to see this film. I came out with a new idea of what makes a great film a masterpiece. The acting is brilliant all around, the story is extremely captivating, and the emotions reach all time highs. This movie is wonderfully told and beautifully designed. This film should go down as one of the greats in the annals of movie lore. It is emotionally moving and stunning. The triumphs and sufferings of each individual character are heartfelt and understood on a deeply personal level. If there are only a few films that you could see, I would most assuredly recommend putting 'Million Dollar Baby' at the top of the list.

11 August 2005,Very good movie about an aspiring woman boxer.,"This movie is really two movies in one. The first half is about an aspiring woman boxer and the problems she must overcome to get where she wants to go, and also about her trainer and how he gets involved with her. But the second half of this movie is the real drama, about how people affect each other's lives and how they find meaning by taking that one shot and how they face adversity. I would have given this movie a perfect ten but I was really in the mood for something a little more uplifting, instead of deep. Still, the acting couldn't have been better, the plot was interesting, the cinematography was good, the direction was excellent. Go see it!

21 May 2006,horrible,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1

6 March 2005,Great movie!,"If any movie deserved an Oscar for sure then this movie is it. Million Dollar Baby is without any doubt the best American movie of the year. It seems to be a little biographic but it's not. It's a very emotional movie that goes in the exactly right pace to land the ""big punch"" in the end.

Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are giving an absolutely wonderful performance, especially Hilary Swank. She looks like the role of Maggie Fitzgerald was made for her, a little like she doesn't even need to act. Clint Esatwood plays very well the tough (well, more then tough since ""tough ain't enough) trainer in all situations, although there was something that bothered me about him but I wouldn't be able to name it. Morgan Freeman is actually playing quite a small role even 'though he is in many scenes. I can't say much about his performance because it looks like quite an easy role but I can say at least that he looked absolutely natural.

The fighting scenes were all from weak to great but you don't remember the weak ones anyway because they last for few seconds only. They are there only to be passed so who really cares that boxing doesn't really looks this way. I don't think this movie is even about boxing after all, it's absolutely nothing like the famous boxing movies. It's a totally different story and I'm not willing to share any of it with those who didn't see it because one of the things I enjoyed the most was not knowing even a small bit of the story while watching. This way I enjoyed it completely. It's like this movie got pure joy and pure sadness in it (damn, I hope it's not a spoiler). All of course is thanks to a great directing by Clint Eastwood.

So for conclusion, I think it's a must see for everyone. There is absolutely no chance that you won't enjoy it.",9
17 December 2004,clint is a master,"How long has it been since Clint had 2 good movies in a row? How many Blood Works and Space Cowboys must we endure before he pulls out a hat trick like this? After the masterpiece that was Mystic River, this was a refreshing surprise to see the old master do it back to back. It is so rare to see a sports movie that is about....sports! But this did it with wit and sentiment that was never cheap or cheezy.

Hilary Swank proved once again that she actually has acting chops and isn't just that chick who played that chick who thought she was a dude. This is the real deal. Morgan Freeman was solid as ever. But all praise to where it is due: Clint.

Kudos on Clint's directing, his stirring score and his understated, but superb acting.

24 June 2005,"Sometimes I despair, I really do....","Look, what passes for emotion in this movie isn't emotion at all. This is a shallow, hotch potch, thrown together cliché ridden movie that thinks very little of it's audience and insults said audience's intelligence from the word go.

Go on, count them off - all the required elements are there. The script is incredibly unoriginal and the story telling is just downright lazy. The performances by Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are watchable, but Clint Eastwood faxes his performance in. That the academy would fall over itself to shower this mess with accolades says all you need to know about where their loyalties lie. Talk about honour your own...

And why is it Hilary Swank's character can only be beaten by a cheating ex East Berliner? Pathetic...

6 March 2005,A near masterpiece that rocks your heart,"This movie is not a typical boxing movie.Thew script is perfect in a classic way,the actors are great and the surprise near the end hit your heart like no other movie has done in recent years.Clint Eastwood is a good storyteller in John Ford's tradition(many shots are like Ford's movies) but with modern themes and without obvious sentimentalism.(Ford used it sometimes,although did masterpieces like The Searchers, The grapes of Wrath or Stagecoach among many others).May the only failure of this great movie is the portrait of the girl's family (too obvious and manipulative for my taste),but this is a hell of good movie.Bravo for Clint,i'm only 22 years old ,but your cinema likes me much more than many young directors of today.

5 February 2005,"I was impressed, actually one of the best of the year.","Cant say that for Aviator (it was good but not Oscar material), Ray, Sideways, and that 50th peter pan movie, but this one actually deserves a best pic nom, and quite a few others. The performances all around deserve noms, but Colin Farrel still deserves the win for actor. The story is simple, deep, but still interesting, and provides many humorous, dramatic, shocking, and entertaining moments. Much better then Mystic River, which was only worth seeing once, but this is a movie that will be remembered because you can tell Clint was passionate about it, very, and it comes into you. Its better then Rocky, so its the best boxing movie, even though there's only a total of about 20 to 30 mins of actual boxing, but even in that area it beats Rocky which had 1 fight only, the fights are sometimes funny, sometimes enthralling, and most of the time shocking. Ebert actually got one right this year, somewhat, he said this was the best film of the year, close, id say the fourth, Alexander, Troy, and Passion of the Christ are still the top three, for me, not for very many else, but i don't care, i like what i like. I give this a 9 out of a 10.

19 August 2009,Million Hearts Won,"To tell you the truth I'm not a big fan of boxing, in fact I think it is basically repugnant sport (if two people trying to brain each other can really be considered a sport). So for this film to win me over, it had to be really special. And it was. One of the reasons for this is that although the film does show the positive aspects of boxing, it doesn't glorify it. You see everything – the glory, the pain, the heartbreak, the feeling of belonging that is all some people have to hold on to. This film takes you on a real roller-coaster of emotion, taking you from the bottom to the top and back again.

Million Dollar Baby is the story of a female boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), her trainer Frankieie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), and his sidekick and business partner Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood about boxing after Raging Bulls. But mind you Million Dollar Baby is not a feminist version of Raging Bull, intent on bludgeoning the audience with gritty violence. Nor is it a maudlin rewrite of 'The Champ' or a woman's version of 'Rocky'. Million Dollar Baby is a rhapsody about life, using the harsh world of boxing as a metaphor.

In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Frankie is a trainer and manager who never seems to know when to make a move or throw in the towel. He is also the owner of the Hit Pit, a boxing gym where would-be contenders look to flourish under Frankie. The gym manager is one of his former boxers, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). After Eddie's career ended, Frankie became less sure of himself as a manager. Eddie tells us, though, that Frankie is the best cut man he's ever seen. Frankie can prepare virtually anyone to get back into the ring between rounds.

Enter Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman who squeaks out a living by waiting tables at a local restaurant. She has some street smarts, and some talents using her fists. Her dream is to be a champion female boxer and she knows just the place to practice- the gymnasium operated by Frankie. Maggie wants Frankie to be her coach and her persistence pays off when he finally gives in and agrees to train her in the sport of boxing.

What makes this film so entertaining is its winning formula. On every level, this movie succeeds at captivating the audience and making them anticipate the next scene. Here story isn't as predictable as other sports films and many scenes will catch you off guard. A great movie does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft.

'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is life about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.",8
6 February 2005,Elements of movie-making shine in this film,"This is an almost flawless movie (other than needless profanity from a Catholic priest). Extremely poignant for a movie centered on the boxing world, this movie is a female Rocky for the 2000s.

Of course, it is more multi-dimensional as it takes a hard look from not only the boxer's vantage point, but also that of the trainer-manager, too. The intricacies of the protoypical father-daughter relationship -- and the inferred protectionist attitudes therein -- are juxtaposed with the hard-knock, gritty world of female boxing.

The twist at the end is surprising. The movie may end a bit too abruptly, but it makes one think. It has a strong moral play that goes beyond the bounds of boxing, and raises questions of utility for those possibly discard by the rest of society. I can't say any more or this will be a spoiler.

Almost all of the elements of movie-making shine in this film. None more so than direction and acting. Truly artistry at every turn.",10
27 September 2020,Worst sports movie ever.,"Appearantly the matches are extremely unrealistic, not only the villain break many rules for which she would have been instantly disqualificied, but she kept doing it and the worst part is not just if the referee did not see it, no, he did saw it all and said ""you do it one more time you're disqualificied"", it's so unrealistic and pathetic I could barely watch. If you know anything about boxing, things like that even starts riots and stuff, for example when Mike Tyson has bitten his opponent's ear.

Another terrible thing about this film is that the last half of it is just poor cheap emotional drama which drags on and on. It's boring, lame, you know how's it going to end but it keeps draging on and on.

Oscar bait at it's worst.

8 March 2005,"as usual, clint is slow, but good","almost all of eastwoods directorial work seems above reproach (lets just not bring up blood work) but as much as i like the stories he tells, i wish he could just tell them a little faster. on the surface, they seem fairly conventional stories, not much new, but clint always has a way of getting at all the emotions hiding beneath the surface.i really like the noir like use of lighting & darkness , but sometimes the snail like pace does seem to drag a bit. I'm not gonna bother tellin ya the plot or the surprise, ill leave ya to discover that on your own, though if you're payin any attention at all, I'm sure you'll figure out what all the controversy has been about long before the end comes, though being predictable never feels like a flaw with eastwoods movies. its not the end that counts, its the trail ya walk to get there.

2 March 2007,"A brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death","""Million Dollar Baby"" is on its surface a story about a female boxer and the aging fight manager and gym owner who trains her, which might lead one to think of it as sort of a female version of ""Rocky."" But it is much more. At its core this film is a brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death. Clint Eastwood proved again with this film that he is one of the great American directors, in a class with his hero, John Ford. Under his direction both Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman won well deserved Oscars and Eastwood himself won two more for Best Picture and Best Director. Finally, Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.

No movie is perfect and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is no exception. Many of its characters are cartoonish characterizations, used as props for the more fully developed manager Frankie, played by Eastwood, His fighter, Maggie, played by Swank, and ""Scrap,"" Frankie's faithful friend and employee, played by Freeman. Maggie's hillbilly family, the brutish fighter, who Maggie fought for a championship, and a couple of the hangers on in Frankie's gym are examples of the less than believable characters in the film.

But don't be put off by these overdrawn characters, for they are merely props designed to illustrate the relationships among Frankie, Maggie, and Scrap, who are fully realized and entirely believable. Frankie and Maggie come to love one another as the father and daughter each has lost. Although Scrap and Frankie are each other's dearest friend, each recognizes the weaknesses of the other. These relationships are used to dramatize the anguish of a moral dilemma and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of great odds. Not to be missed.",10
9 January 2009,Better than all of the Rocky films combined,"I have come to enjoy very, very few sports films, but this movie is great. Everything about it is put together so as to bring about a story not just about winning at a tough sport, but connecting with others and building a better future for them. The narration by Morgan Freeman was good. He was a great choice for that and for his role as the gym's caretaker. Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman all do very well with their characters, and I'm glad that they've managed a boxing movie that did not have to rely on so many sequels to get the job done. Awesome, tear-jerking, and fun.

29 January 2005,Million Dollar Baby is a Must-See for all!,"I am a sixteen year old girl who begged her grandmother to take her to see Million Dollar Baby. Little did I know that I would walk out of the theater with my life changed forever. This film tells an astonishing story of life, determination, and the incredible relationships that you can build with people. Clint Eastwood brilliantly directs and stars in this movie alongside Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. They all deliver true, emotional, and heart-wrenching performances that show how dedicated all actors should should be to their work. From watching the movie I realized how important my relationships with the people I love are and that my goals can be reached if I stay focused and work hard. I want to thank Clint Eastwood especially for pouring his heart and soul into this project. To everyone involved in the film, I hope you continue to receive all of the recognition you deserve. I also want to urge everyone to get out and see Million Dollar Baby. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll forever be inspired once you witness this bittersweet tale.

30 July 2010,Fantastic on all levels,"I came into this movie having a feeling I was going to be disappointed. I don't really know why, but that just happened. Boy was I wrong. It starts off with great dialogue and continues throughout the movie, with many instances of memorable quotes. The characters were fun but also very serious and believable. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman had some funny moments together which was nice considering the rest of the movie was a hard drama. This movie also has some fantastic morals and metaphors thrown everywhere, and it may take a second viewing or more to find more of them. Just everything about this movie had me loving it, so I give it a perfect 10.

31 March 2008,Three-Disc DVD Set Highlights An Eastwood Masterwork With a Powerful Turn by Swank,"It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his film-making techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.

Written by Paul Haggis (""Crash""), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version of ""Rocky"". A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.

How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a film-making master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.

As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" has he made himself so vulnerable on screen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voice-over letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in ""The Shawshank Redemption"". That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.

The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, ""Born to Fight"", which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is ""The Producers' Round 15"", a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, ""James Lipton Takes on Three"" with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of ""Inside the Actors' Studio"". Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony.",9
17 February 2006,It deserved every award it got...,"I was reminded of a great observation I'd once read about film acting when I was watching Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby."" I believe Roger Ebert said(I could be mistaken there), in an analysis of great film actors, that Marlon Brando showed us all everything that could be brought to a film performance, that Paul Newman learned that from Brando, and then went on to learn what could be left out. Clint Eastwood learned from a lot of great directors in his days as one of the greatest movie stars in the world, and he's become one of the greatest directors we have, because he's confident enough, and disciplined enough, to know exactly what he needs to show you, so that you understand why the characters have made the choices they've made.

Million Dollar Baby is one of the two best films Eastwood has given us(his other Best Picture winner, ""Unforgiven"" would be the other one), and it's superb because every single scene, every single line, builds on the one before it. It's a masterpiece of story-telling economy(all the more miraculous because Eastwood shot Paul Haggis' first draft of the script) that pulls you in to the classic story of an underdog boxer that gets a shot at the big time only to then break your heart without ever taking a false or cheap step. This movie doesn't depend on a twist-- the ending is where this story was heading the entire time. It's just that the writer, the director, and the actors(Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, all perfectly cast and at the top of their game) have too much story-telling integrity to let you ever get ahead of them.

It's simple, it's powerful, it's honest, and it's heartbreaking. You can't ask for much more than this.",10
11 February 2005,Flawed and therefore overrated,"Eastwood's film about a veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on a female fighter starts slowly, builds in excitement, then abruptly runs out of ideas. I won't give away the ending (I've heard that if you do Eastwood comes round and personally beats the crap out of you), but I will say I found it clumsy, contrived and (worst crime) far too drawn out.

The film works fine in the claustrophobic atmosphere of Eastwood's gym, but when Eastwood and Swank move out into the wider world it gets lost. Eastwood is preparing Swank for a world title fight, but where are the promoters, the agents, the TV crews(the fights appear to televise themselves, the lawyers, for goodness sake? Why doesn't anyone offer Swank sponsorship (for example Everlast, who get their logo into every other frame in this movie)? There's a bit where Swank mentions ""magazine articles"" but we never even see her talking to a fan, let alone a journalist. Her entire career seems to take place in a vacuum, when common sense tells you anyone who looked and performed like her would be an instant media sensation.

The problem seems to be lie with the time-frame of the film. It's nominally set in the near-present (Eastwood waves a VHS cassette at one point) but its heart is in the '40s or '50s, or rather a sort of non-specific past mythical past you get in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

There's much to enjoy here in the way of dialogue and cinematography, balanced by some major longeurs and lapses of taste (such as going totally OTT in its determination to stick it to welfare claimants). It's not so very bad, but I can't see where the Oscar nominations are coming from.",
3 February 2005,Pugilistic Poetry,"The more I think about it, the more I am convinced this is the Best Picture of 2004, and it may be better than any since ""L.A. Confidential"". What we have here is a topical rumination on how people generally try and do the best they can, that things still often go askew and how we cope. This is Clint's spin on reducing all to Hemingway's view that the greatest impediments in conducting life are fear and sentimentality.

The story is a simple one, it seems. Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and ex-fighter Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupree (Morgan Freeman) have their less-than-idyllic but tolerably comfortable gym existence invaded by the likes of an aggressively and intensively focused female boxer. Talk about turning lives upside down! The entire scope of the known pugilistic universe is imperiled, and so are the lives of all those that touch newcomer Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) own.

It is a truth that the promotion of this movie has been clever. Packaged as a girl-boxer flick, this is an enormous deception. In all fight films that have preceded this one  and there have been some very very good ones  not one will have left you, in a word, captivated. This is the only poetry I ever saw with gloves on.

Clint Eastwood has graced us with  and I am not sure whether he is to be congratulated, or his questioner, or Film Comment  as cogent and compelling an interview as has been seen in that fine magazine in a long time. I refer you to http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/1-2-2005/ceint.htm for Eastwood's views, but how about this for erudition while speaking volumes to the intelligence of us viewers: ""There is a tendency to treat the audience as if they won't stay with you unless you explain every little thing along the way."" And this speaks to the niceties of Eastwood's efforts in his later years. Look for the small things, a gesture, an aside  Morgan Freeman mutters some niceties, the lighting and especially the music.

I cannot in good faith recall a movie that moved me as much as ""Million Dollar Baby"". Not ever. Maybe it is my academic research in subjects of this ilk, perhaps my 52-year old maleness, or that I have one child  a major-babe remarkably-gifted go-getting daughter, or that I had I've had my own questions about what greatness entails and what a successful life might be, or how I've dealt with just about any and all of the human issues Mr. Eastwood touches on in this remarkable film. And it must be said that the knockout blow delivered by ""Million Dollar Baby""  a message or perhaps reflection on topics that speak to our most private fears  is truly the stuff of a Best Picture.

Rating: Four Stars.",
11 September 2005,It sure got heart...,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",7
5 February 2005,A movie to enjoy on many levels,"There is not much more I can add to the praise already posted about Million Dollar Baby. The acting, direction, lighting, cinematography, script, etc. were outstanding -- particularly Hilary Swank. Not a perfect film -- but very nearly. The best movie I've seen in several years.

What amazes me is the reactions of those who hate the film...primarily because of the last third of it. Others have pointed out that this probably stems from the naysayers objection to being asked to really feel and think during a film that they anticipated as another Rocky. Eastwood didn't suddenly change directions -- the last third of the film is the point of his film. He didn't betray his audience -- everything before that final 35 minutes or so was the foundation for that ending.

A movie that challenges us to examine our beliefs and preconceptions is a rarity these days -- at least in the US industry. By not supplying a lot of details about his characters, he was respecting his audience's ability to use little hints and nuances to grasp their backgrounds.

Again, this is a wonderful film.",
12 April 2005,Emotional Devestating,"Sometimes there's a movie that devestates you so much, you look through the credits, just recovering from the impact it gave you. Shawshank redemption did that, as Schindler's list and American Beauty did, but on top of them there is Million Dollar Baby. Incredible character study from 3 people, each with his own scars... The story built slow but very effective, Clint is as good as in his old days, he plays the old' man, who can't laugh, and when he does, you feel such a thrill through your body, incredible charism this man has. Hilary Swank sets a brilliant performance, as well as Morgan Freeman, you can feel with them all, worried about what's on their mind, and when the emotions of them all come together, you realise how good this movie is. Brilliant directed from Clint, he deserves every praise, I looked forward to this movie so long, and it really shows this is what film is meant to be!

Go see this, it's one of a kind 10/10

27 October 2018,Eastwood's emotional rollercoaster baby!,"My Rating : 8/10

Winner of four Academy Awards, Million Dollar Baby starts off as a tale of determination to chase your dreams but it ends in a sad tale of dealing with difficult situations and the power of friendship. The film's brilliance earned Eastwood his second Oscar for his work behind the camera, it helped that in front of the camera he was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and was paired with Hillary Swank who won for Best Actress and the always wonderful Morgan Freeman who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. A film about boxing that is also an emotional rollercoaster.

1 January 2005,"A vintage of a film by Clint Eastwood -- for mature appreciation, no doubt","A rare true depiction of life's fragility - its dilemma of hopes and dreams, risk taking and facing mishaps - can we ever avoid, do we always blame - does God care? ""Birth, Aging, Sickness, Death"" are inevitable stages to one's life cycle (a Chinese traditional saying).

I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be. Reminds me of the theme of Alejandro Amenábar's ""The Sea Inside"" (a film I've yet to catch - it was shown for only a few days just before Christmas week. A good film with tough subject is so hard to come by.)

Since ""True Crime"" 1999 (which I appreciate and posted comments), I prefer this Eastwood endeavor more than ""Mystic River"" 2003, ""Blood Work"" 2002, ""Space Cowboys"" 2001. Here we have basically a simple story in structure (screenplay by Paul Haggis), focusing on only three main characters (not ensemble casts we've been getting so often lately). This is not exactly a total upbeat film, but it is poignantly true in the expression of feelings, conversations, and the inevitably linked relationships between them - unspoken support to each other in being alive, appreciating living and respecting death.

Yes, the subject of death is not being shied away - it's approached head on with no circumventing the issue. With the ending of year 2004, the many events that involved increasing number of deaths, debate on wars, disasters, religious beliefs - the question of faith does come into play. There are no straightforward answers to questions of morality or the right thing to do - God's or man's decision (one believes that God works in mysterious ways for reasons one may not understand fully). And so the ending, be it a resigned assumption or not, it boils down to trusting one's heart with faith. And Freeman's calm voice closes well as it began - almost with a poetic touch to the tone.

The music lingered on (Lennie Niehaus orchestrated) beyond the credits roll. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a loaded title (precious Maggie that appeared from nowhere; replacing an empty spot of an unreachable daughter; the professional status Maggie attained; takes a lot of heart to train her; takes a lot of courage to fulfill her request). The film did present and tackled a thoughtful subject after all. This may not be a Hollywood blockbuster, but the three stars' impeccably inhabited roles in this quintessential Eastwood film certainly warrant equal appreciation.",8

30 January 2005,The best by the best,"Clint Eastwood has put together a body of work of acting, directing and producing that is unequalled by any other ""Hollywood"" personage. His latest, Million Dollar Baby, is the best of all of the wonderful things he had done over the years. This film has the power to move the viewer to the core of your soul, and you become one with the three central characters and the story, which is not about boxing, but about love. But what should leave you awestruck is what Eastwood is able to get from Hilary Swank.....a performance that will rank as one of the all time greats, and one which will stay with you long after you have left the theater.....her face and her voice and her grit and loyalty seem enbedded in your consciousness for day, and you cannot shake it. If you love film, you must see Million Dollar Baby, you will love Hilary Swank's Maggie MacGuire beyond words, and you will be equally moved by the chemistry between Eastwood, Swank and Freeman which has produced one of the most stunning and powerful movies I have seen----and I started with him when he was Rowdy Yates......oh, how far he has come, and how much I have loved the ride with Clint, I only hope that moviegoers will appreciate what this man has given the art of film over his long and distinguished career...Thank you Clint",

6 February 2005,Now I see what all the fuss is about...,"I never doubted this movie was good, but I was eager to find out why it was good. And I was, of course, curious about the ""plot twist"" everyone was talking about.

This is an incredible little movie. Keep in mind that it is ""little,"" because with all the awards this movie has taken home already, some might be fooled into thinking it is more than that. But hey, little is good.

If you don't know already what the story is about, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Ageing, haunted Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns an old boxing gym. He is so full of guilt over his estranged daughter, Katie, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who refuses to read his letters, that he goes to mass every day. It's starting to get on the nerves of his priest. His only friend is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who watches over the place for Frankie, and keeps people in line.

Frankie has a good fighter he's managing, but he doesn't like risks. He's holding him back from a title shot. His fighter likes Frankie, but he wants his shot at the title. He realizes if he's going to get anywhere, he needs to look elsewhere. Simultaneously, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a white-trash waitress from Missouri, wants to learn how to fight. Frankie won't train her, until he realizes her potential, and is egged on by Scrap. That's as much detail as should probably be revealed.

The movie is almost entirely shot in underexposed film, giving it a dark, washed-out look that complements the boxing theme. It's like the entire movie takes place in a boxing ring, and that's where the lighting and colors are most alive. Eastwood has made a superb follow-up to his masterpiece of scarred Bostonians, ""Mystic River."" Like that film, this one has a strong undercurrent of Irish heritage and Catholicism. Frankie reads Gallic in his spare time, and even gives Maggie a nickname in the language. The detail given to the environment is also very similar. While in ""Mystic River"" everything seemed cold and stark, here it's just dark and claustrophobic. This is a smaller movie, but it is just as good.

And everyone in the movie gives first-rate performances. Hilary Swank has tapped into that same great ability that won her the Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry."" I have always liked Morgan Freeman, and a lot of other people have, too, I know, but after a number of relative duds, he's reminded me why he's such a good actor. And finally, the real treat is Clint Eastwood. Some people may have written him off as a man who can't really act much. But either way, he's almost always played the same tough, hard-edged characters, people who at some point or other are willing to take a stand. Here, that persona, his persona, is not even there. Here, he is a man who has been falling apart for some time, and has payed the price for holding people back. But he unfolds into a man of compassion, who just wishes he could have the chance to fix his mistakes in life. The fact that he's seventy-four and looks it only helps in conveying his inner demons.

This I know is not a movie for people who don't like to watch boxing movies. I don't like boxing, but movie depictions can be good. There are some bits of dry humor in the movie, and some that even take place inside the ring. The movie is also very heartrending. If you don't care for deeply emotional movies, don't watch it. But I personally give it a 10.",10
7 November 2005,Eastwood's Worst Film yet,"What in the world was the Academy thinking?!! Eastwood's movies get slower and slower, more and more tedious as he ages. At least in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil the tedious pace worked with the storyline. If possible, this was even a worse movie than the over-hyped Mystic River that took a great book and turned it into a chore of a movie to watch.

And Hilary Swank? All you have to do to win an Oscar is put some mashed taters in yer mouth and try to speak and you're a great actress? Shoulda been any of the other nominees but her.

Moving on to Morgan Freeman... Another walk on in a long string of walk ons. For a man with such obvious talent, where's the beef? Moving on to Eastwood himself... You've already heard my opinion on his directing style and now the acting (and I use the term loosely). Clint adds this to a long and still growing list of broken heroes,has beens and other sad sack ""strong and silent"" types. I personally think he needs to retire from both sides of the camera. At least he didn't embarrass himself with a nude scene with someone young enough to be his granddaughter again. Uggghhh!! If you have an opportunity to view this movie run, don't walk, back to the video store and rent a superior film, you know, like Gigli maybe. OK I'm just kidding about the Gigli part.",1
24 January 2005,wow what a movie,"I am glad that I do not have to choose the Academy Award for best picture of the year, as it would be a hard choice picking between Ray and Million Dollar Baby. The cast was outstanding with Hillary Swank, giving another stellar performance, as well as Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman. The direction by Clint Eastwood was very good as this performance was as good as I have ever seen Eastwood. It has been a long time since I have been to a preview that the audience got up at the end of the picture and applauded. In my opinion I agree with the ovation. I think that I would pick Million Dollar Baby as my pick for the Academy Award, not only for the fine acting, but the story itself.

24 December 2007,Million Dollar Film-making.,"I suppose when you discuss the most famous boxing films about people who didn't actually exist; nine out of ten film fans may point at Rocky for one reason or another and whilst I haven't seen Rocky at this present time, I would challenge them to give Million Dollar Baby a chance in trying to de-throne Rocky as the film at the top of their particular opinion. I hear and read that some say this is better than Raging Bull; well yes, as a boxing film I can categorically say it is better than Raging Bull but in terms of individual acting performance and character study it isn't  we really got to know La Motta in Raging Bull; we were there through everything and experienced it with him even if the actual boxing scenes in the film were rather poor.

In Million Dollar Baby, rather than put everything into one character in a blisteringly entertaining and effective way; Eastwood spreads the study around the whole cast: We discover what we need to know about Eddie Dupris (Freeman) when it's necessary and he fulfills his own little goal in the film; we come to learn what sort of a person Danger Barch (Baruchel) is and his story is more tragic than it is anything else and of course; there is the relationship between student and teacher that Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) share which is the primary study of the film. First of all, I would in no way say this was a typical sports film where the hero starts off good; suffers a tragedy; works their way back up; gets a mentor and then gets ready for a final showdown with the bad guy. Million Dollar Baby sort of starts at point three in the last sentence and then skips the final point altogether as there is no antagonist in this film. Any 'showdown' that you could feasible use as an example would be when Maggie must face up to her redneck family who have shunned her her whole life up until a certain point but of course; this has nothing to do with sports: the film's genre.

Million Dollar Baby is a film that studies the space within the frame. It utilises a boxing ring, a gym and its surrounding areas as a statement about certain characters early on in the film in a brilliant manner. Frankie has his office which is set away from the rest of the gym, up high looking down on everything since he's the boss of the place  he is reminded as well as haunted by his previous success as a trainer with his masses of trophies and victories staring down further yet upon him. Danger is a lost and wondering soul who keeps saying he is going to challenge a champion boxer for a belt yet little does he know that boxing has long since retired: Danger occupies the ring most of the time which acts as a large and open space of nothingness as he repeats his dream he will never achieve and his boxing skills he cannot use. Eddie occupies a small room set away from the gym and everyone else; he is secluded from most of the action and occupies the lowest quality dwelling of the establishment; although not a racial element, this says things about his character that he is a cleaner; that his life is now simple after the dizzying highs and lows of his own boxing career.

Given these pieces of evidence, Maggie's own space is one of many. She is seen in the ring, in the gym, in a new home and later on in two new spaces which would give away the tragic event that propel the final third. Maggie persists on using the 'speed back' which perhaps reflects she wants to hit away in fast motion the depravity through relief of her bad life. Like most sports films, the middle section of the film usually contains a montage: I recently saw John Dahl's 'Rounders' which follows such a formula mentioned earlier on but cleverly informs us that Poker is in fact, a sport but in Million Dollar Baby; the obligatory montage doesn't seem to come yet at the same time, it's there. What I mean by this is that although Maggie knocks everyone out in the first round; this is due to the fact she has such a drive in her quest for the American Dream through boxing that she really is that good: every time we see the hero wipe the floor with everyone in a montage, maybe we roll our eyes but here I was sold  she's wiping the floor with them because she really is that determined and that skillful.

The film also challenges sexuality and what males find sexually attractive in films. Laura Mulvey once wrote that every film is shot for a male to watch and yet the women in Million Dollar Baby are hard bodied boxers who get sweaty, build their bodies and keep their hair short: there is nothing attractive in the film no matter how badly you get turned on by the thought of a woman beating you up. The evidence here is in the form of extremely quick shots of girls dressed in tight bikinis holding up numbers telling us what round it is in-between rounds. This is the film identifying that the boxers are not objects of the gaze whilst Eastwood knows he has to prove that they're not: the ring girls do this. Despite it's poor representation during the final fight where the final fighter is black and German (a black German girl!?) whose trainers dress in shady leather coats and look menacing; Million Dollar Baby succeeds through excellent spread characterisation and a stupendous narrative even if some of the people attending the fights look a little like they don't belong there but that's what the film's about: spaces; wrong place at the wrong time.",8
21 January 2005,A fight to the finish.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

18 January 2005,"Wonderful, moving film, must see of 2005","Million Dollar Baby was a film I was expecting to like after seeing the trailer. I thought it was just going to be about boxing in the sense of young girl goes to train with veteran boxing trainer and becomes world champion...the end. But it was so much more than that. As others have commented before, the film explores life itself through the characters and the boxing ring. The acting is superb with Clint Eastwood playing a bitter boxing trainer with a history involving something he regrets. Morgan Freeman narrates superbly just as he did in Shawshank Redemption, and as Eastwood's handyman does not take over the screen. Hilary Swank is outstanding as the girl from the trailer park, turned boxing hero. She plays the role superbly and you feel engaged towards her character. You must see this film, thats all the more i'll say!

17 January 2005,Greatest Movie of All Time,"No doubt in my mind... I am an actor and have seen pretty much all of the greats. I looked down the list of IMDb's greatest 250 movies and I've seen about 80 percent of them. There is not doubt anywhere in my body that this is the greatest movie of all time. Clint Eastwood's direction, paired with his excellent acting, not to mention the amazing performances by Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman make it a clear choice. Eastwood's use of light in this film creates a unique environment that allows us to see the characters how he wanted us to see them. Freeman's narration is very similar to that of his role in ""Shawshank"" and I think he was a perfect casting choice. People who disliked this movie don't understand what makes a movie great and should just stop going to the movies. Your opinion isn't worth while if you can't see the genius of this film.

19 March 2006,A terrific movie with a serious question.....,"Clint Eastwood directs and produces this Best Picture winner, about a woman name Maggie (Hilary Swank)wanted to box and needed a trainer. Clint Eastwood's character doesn't want to train a girl, but after he watch her constantly practicing at his gym he decides to train her. As the movie progresses Maggie finds herself going into fame and later realizing what the price of fame is....

Hilary Swank won her second Oscar for her role, and Morgan Freeman finally won for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an old trainer. Clint Eastwood won Best Director and the coveted Best Picture prize. This film is not only heart felt, but also applies a serious question, which I can't say what is or I'll spoil the movie. I think you'll find that question when you watch this movie.

10 January 2007,A brutally realistic tale not suitable for all viewers,"Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999). It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award. The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best. I would not however recommend that everybody see this. The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.

Morgan Freeman as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Scrap is addressing somebody. At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say). This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.

Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words ""Return to Sender"" on them. Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him. I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter. Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.

The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman. But the story does not end like a ""Rocky"" contrivance. Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people. There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.

But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone. It is also Frankie's. And it is Scrap-Iron's as well. If only Frankie had not trained her. If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner. If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie. ""If only,"" like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens. Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that. Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.

At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma. Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion. Yet he feels he must do it.

How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not. His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.

I quit watching boxing on TV many ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless. I don't like feeling like that. This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.

Some people might be wondering what the message here is. I'm not sure, but I can tell you this: Shakespeare essentially said there is no message. Life is tale told by an idiot...in the end signifying nothing. And the existentialists will tell you that life has no meaning except for that which we ourselves bestow upon it. I guess Scrap is the existentialist and Frankie the Shakespearean.

And who is Maggie? And who is everywoman and everyman?

I don't have anything more to say about this film but I have to continue to type because for some bizarre reason, I'm not allowed to make a simple 2 or 3 line comment. IMDb demands at least 10 lines, so now I'm trying to fill space so my comment will be accepted. So I think I'm getting close to line 10 now -- therefore after this sentence I'll stop typing. Oops...still didn't take, so I'll now type 1 more line of ridiculous text to meet the all-important 10-line minimum. Please change your policy, IMDb.

11 February 2005,In a word ... sublime,"Who would have predicted that Clint Eastwood, an actor who started his career in spaghetti westerns forty years ago, would mature into a formidable composer, director, all around film icon, and last but certainly not least, auteur.

Like a fine wine, Eastwood gets better with age, and this film is his crowning achievement to date. In some ways, it is an old fashioned film that echoes The Shawshank Redemption in theme, tone and texture; in other ways, it is thoroughly post-modern.

It is a sad film at its core, but somehow uplifting in its sadness, like a sad blues or jazz piece. Rush out and see it. It may be the best film you see this year!

27 February 2005,Excellent!,"OK, I finally saw the movie the other day, and it was as good as I expected it to be. It was just great. Excellent storyline. I really enjoyed it. Both, Hilary and Clint did an excellent job. They didn't seem like they were acting, it seemed so real and natural. I hope she gets the Oscar again. She just put all her emotions there. I have to say that she was as good in this movie like when she did Boys Don't Cry. Although I haven't seen Being Julia and Annette Benning performance in that movie. I've heard a lot of people saying that it was really good. I also liked Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I believe she deserves to be nominated for Best Actress instead of Supporting Actress.

27 March 2019,MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE !!! MUST WATCH BEFORE YOU DIE....,"It is very touching movie! I just saw it for the name of Clint Eastwood 'cause I am big fan of him recently. This is his second movie I saw. Before see the movie I thought it would be a Rocky style movie where hero wins at the end in any situation. But here movie is totally different. At last crucial fight of Maggie she got hurt and made her to lying down in the bed. How pity! But my surprise, the real drama is just starting then and ends only in tearful eyes. I never expect such ending. It was a shock. That's why movie being different from others. It has two separate section first half is only boxing in pit and ring and rest second is in hospital. Clint Eastwood has a brilliant and super acting as well as Hilary Swank too. Other is Morgan Freeman. Direction by CE is also superb. There is no wonder for winning 4 Oscars for such all time best movie. I strongly recommended for every movie lovers. Must watch (before you die.....as a list on IMDB).

His direction is just tremendous. I know his Oscar is awaiting. Acting-wise I think this was Clint's best performance. He rips the screen apart in every scene. He can be very humorous at times, and then he can be the total opposite, ""Stubborn-Old-Man"". His plays his role with ease. While best supporting actor award should be reserved for Morgan, cause damn he surely deserves it. He voice, his voice, his voice.There is absolutely no actor like him. He's just too natural. The show -stealer Hilary Swank gives a top notch performance. I know she worked day and night for this role to get in shape and learn boxing, but her role demanded way more than a few punches here n there, and she delivered. And boy did she deliver a ""knock-out"" performance. Screenplay by Paul Haggis is amazing. Editing is crisp. Its a pure classic. A Movie that will make you think for days and days.",10
6 November 2005,A Knockout for Clint,"Forty years ago, Clint Eastwood was immersed in a trio of spaghetti westerns. Fifteen years later he was playing second banana to an orangutan named Clyde. Somewhere between the 1970s and turning 70, Mr. Eastwood became one hell of a director. Unforgiven landed him multiple Oscars, while Mystic River brought him some of the best reviews of his film-making career. The recent release of Million Dollar Baby has given even his most ardent doubters pause, displaying his continuously expanding talents before and behind the camera.

Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is an aging boxing trainer whose modest gym acts as a second home to a ragtag crew of wannabes and runaways. His one genuinely gifted fighter leaves him shortly before hitting it big, citing Dunn's over-protective nature as the reason for his departure. Dunn's fears reach an all-time high when he finally agrees to train newcomer Maggie (Hilary Swank), despite an aversion to coaching women. Her persistence and stubbornness eventually wear him down. As expected, she proves herself a natural, overcoming every opponent in her path.

Swank's performance as the loyal, scrappy underdog cements her status as one of the great actresses of her generation. Eastwood's surprisingly emotional performance is a far cry from the one-dimensional, deadpan delivery he made chic decades ago. The story itself unfolds in unexpected ways, but its simple honesty is what truly sets it apart from many of today's flashier, self-important films. A few missteps aside, this is easily one of 2004's best efforts. Don't miss it.

Rating: A-",9
19 April 2005,WOW! Who would have guessed? Well maybe the Academy did.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

19 February 2005,Close To Perfection,"Plain and simple this movie is almost a perfect movie. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is that I personally don't believe there is a perfect movie. This gets as close as it gets. Clint Eastwood was very good, and I am not a big fan of his. Morgan Freeman was kind of wasted, but was still terrific, they just didn't give him much to do. Hilary Swank's performance was beyond words. Never have I been so moved to laugh and to cry as I was by this film. It made me want to stand up and cheer, made me want to cry my eyes out, made me laugh my ****s off, and really, REALLY made me wish this movie would not end. If you can only see one movie this year, or next year, you will be doing yourself a service by seeing this movie!

If Swank doesn't win Best Actress, the Oscars will forever be tainted in my eyes.......

29 January 2008,A Perfect Film,"After having watched this movie for probably the tenth time, I feel compelled to shout my love for it from a mountain top (or at least, from the IMDb commentary page)! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece in all possible respects. The brilliant screenplay could in no way be improved upon. The story is beautiful, gritty, sweet, tragic, warmly funny at times, and profound. The method of delivery as the story is written (which we find out at the end), is not merely icing on the cake, it's like lightning striking a crate of fireworks stored in the viewer's heart.

The acting is impeccably understated, as it should be. I watched it this last time trying to imagine how it would have played if the lines were said differently, by anyone else. (I'm a movie dork, I know.) It could have come off as really schmaltzy and melodramatic if the actors hadn't been so very sensitive, and the direction hadn't been right on key.

Speaking of direction, I suppose it's time we mentioned one Sir (he must be a ""Sir"" by now, mustn't he? Dude's an artistic genius after all...) Clint Eastwood. Not only did he bring the ideal combination of crotchetiness and underlying tenderness to the roll of ""Frankie"", aka ""Boss"", with his acting, not only did he direct (gently--I've heard he's the favorite director of all actors) the gifted Oscar-Winners Hilary Swank and (the incomparable) Morgan Freeman to do their finest, he actually composed the emotionally resonant soundtrack!

I find myself torn between wanting to prostrate (not prostate, that's something else altogether) myself before Mr. Eastwood, and wanting to slap him upside the head for being so darn talented... Bastard. (Just kidding!) My only disappointment was that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.

This film is not for the faint of heart. I went in thinking it would be like ""Rocky"". It was, for the majority of it... then it took a most unexpected dramatic turn. I loved ""Rocky"", but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an entirely different animal: an animal to be reckoned with, and an animal to be loved.",10
7 January 2005,"Clint Eastwood is a genius storyteller, director...awesome movie!","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a must see film. I was riveted watching this movie. In an era of lackluster movies and cookie-cutter film making, it is refreshing to see a quality film that distinguishes itself as a sure contender for an Oscar nod.

The character portrayals by Morgan Freeman, Eastwood and Hillary Swank (wow), was just incredible. The storyline was well developed and the plot twisted in directions that bucked conventional apple-pie/tidy endings. This was a ""real"" movie, it tugs at emotions without trying! Most significantly, this is an inspiring movie that will motivate people to remain steadfast in achieving their life goals.

If a person leaves this picture without having been emotionally moved (and hopefully inspired my its message to pursue personal life goals), their heart is dark, cold, and stony.

Clint Eastwood made a quality picture that adds to his filmography as one of his best works ever! Great movie, great acting, great story, and kudos to all involved with the project!",10
8 February 2005,"10 out of 10, all-time great","Hey everybody, this past Saturday, I saw ""Million Dollar Baby"", a film starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. I wanted to just let you all know how much I enjoyed the film, and let you know I highly recommend it, and the reasons why....I am not some big time film critic, but I do feel as though I have a good sense of what a genuienly good film is....Million Dollar Baby exceeded my expectations in so many ways, there is no doubt in my mind it is the best movie of 2004.

I'm going to start of by saying ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the best movies you could ever see. From start to finish, it has all the key elements that every great film should have.

A+ actors, who deliver top notch acting, a gripping, compelling story(which is based on true events, by the way), interesting characters, and a story filled with amazing dramatics, full of emotions, and heart.

I believe one critic said it best: "" The kind of movie where you sit very quietly in the theater and are drawn deeply into lives that you care very much about. "" There is much more to this movie then ""it's just a boxing movie."" Million Dollar Baby at it's core, is a movie dealing with guilt, responsibility for risk, and determination to do what you believe is right.

Hilary Swank is incredible. She firmly establishes herself as a top leading actress in the business for years to come in this.

Don't listen to what anyone else has to say about Million Dollar Baby. Do not let anyone tell you anything that happens, or spoil the ending for you, go see it for yourself.

It's one of the very few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would confidently recommend everyone to go see.

I give it a 10 out of 10.",9
17 February 2005,Another solid and gut-wrenching film from Eastwood,"It is an interesting phenomenon to me that some actors, regardless of their popularity, are much better directors than actors. Sidney Pollack and Ron Howard come to mind immediately, but I feel that the personification of this idea is Clint Eastwood, whose film ""Million Dollar Baby"" is absolutely wonderful.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank), a waitress described as ""white trash"", who is in reality, everything her reputation is not. Born and raised in the deep south and raised in a family of lazy, horrible people, she turns up at the training gym of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), begging him to train her for the women's boxing circuit. When he repeatedly says no, she continues to train furiously, until he relents and the two (plus Frankie's right hand man Eddie Dupris, played by Morgan Freeman) strike up a working relationship that quickly develops into a deep friendship. When Maggie is injured during the most important match of her life, their relationship reaches an even greater level, where they both have to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.

I went into ""Million Dollar Baby"" with a couple of preconceptions, something that I try not to do. Luckily, they ended up working in favor of me enjoying the film. Firstly, of the Eastwood-directed films I have seen, (namely ""Play Misty for Me"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", I acknowledged that they were good films. In the case of ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", they were really good, if not great films. ""Million Dollar Baby"" falls squarely into that category as well. The film's story is compelling (and somewhat controversial, at least for some people) until its conclusion, a very refreshing thing to behold, particularly nowadays when twenty pages of script seem to constitute a feature length screenplay.

Regarding the script, there was not a moment when I didn't buy what was being presented to me, and I think that this is partly thanks to the superior performances of the three primary actors. ""Performance"" isn't even a fair word to use in this case because there was never a moment where I felt that they were ""acting"". Despite the heavy dramatic themes, histrionics were not present. Hilary Swank is simply amazing, and shows that given the right material, she will take the role and make it hers alone; I cannot fathom anyone else doing her complicated role any kind of justice. Morgan Freeman  someone give this man an Oscar. I'm not entirely sure how many times you can be consistently excellent in a role before they are actually given public recognition for their talents, but once again, he pulls out a great supporting role as a variant of his ""Shawshank"" character, only with a lot more vinegar in him. The biggest surprise for me, however, was Clint Eastwood. As I mentioned earlier, one can appreciate someone for being an icon, but an iconic status does not make one a good actor. (See John Wayne, or more recently, J.Lo for other examples.) His performance in ""Million Dollar Baby"" however, was sublime. Frankie's character is a study in dynamics; he is curmudgeonly yet generous, fierce but tired. He attends church daily, but on some level questions his faith. Perhaps it was the role that he gave himself, but he was a perfect fit. Previously, I'd only seen Eastwood as a squinting, growling man in his roles; and frankly, he does the same thing in this role as well  but in this case it works wonderfully.

As far as Eastwood's direction, it is once again dead-on. The film, despite its violent and emotional themes is very warm, with its lighting and cinematography. The pacing is also excellent. Once again, however, while I feel the film was very good, and I certainly wouldn't be staging my 342nd boycott if it won an Oscar, there was nothing about the film that excited me. The story and the performances grabbed me, but I didn't feel ""excited"" when I left, as I have with about a half dozen other films I've seen in the past year. I mentioned Ron Howard earlier in regard to acting, and I feel compelled to invoke his name again in this instance. His films are good, solid films. But (and not to personalize this too much) when, for example, I saw that ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" were both up for Best Picture, I was disappointed when the former won because it was a ""safe"" choice. A good movie, but nothing dynamic about it. And that's how I feel about Eastwood's films; they are good films, I can't find a lot of things wrong with them, but in general they don't excite me.

I still give ""Million Dollar Baby"" a 7/10, however because it is a very good film, and I think it is very deserving of its Oscar nomination and of the many accolades it has received, both from film critics and regular theatergoers like us alike.

20 July 2005,Mo Cuishle...,"About Clint Eastwood's last movie I'd heard it was something we had seen a million times; very cliché. I don't pretend to get inside the story, because I shouldn't tell much of it, but it is, with a simple look, what we've already seen in ""Rocky"", and maybe in ""Karate Kid""; two classic movies of the genre. But Clint Eastwood doesn't dig the classic, he digs the proper; and the fact of not winning the awards he won this year with ""Mystic River"" is intriguing. And ""Million Dollar Baby"" won them not because of its relation with other films, but on its own right.

The emotional power this movie has and many other things, are comparable to the equally good ""Mystic River"". The thing is Eastwood knows how great he is and he closes with the credits in white; simple, over the black screen in both films. Anyway, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is another movie, and if it entered late in the radar, it didn't matter because Eastwood knew what he had in his hands and what it would be, more than anyone.

Again he looked for stories that excellent screenwriters would adapt (Brian Helgeland the last time, now Paul Haggis), composed the music and produced his piece. However he is not proud, and if one doesn't know what is to see, finds out about all this in the end. This round, he added an habitual detail in his directions, that turned down a couple of years ago, but concluded now in another Oscar nomination: his performance in the movie. Between the darkness and the lights sow well handled under his lead, I was able to see some faces that spoke for themselves, and acted. The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written chats Frankie, his character, shared with Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman). With a lot of knowledge, both men exchanged words as the figures they are and as their characters, friends who have been giving each other support since always, and know that's not going to change, so they're not afraid of honesty. These chats turn out to be between the film's best moments.

Clint directed and acted in top form, without forgetting about the partners around him. In Hilary Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting, getting the best of her, en what is more than a transformation. The transformation is part of the commitment, but the love enters in knowing how to use it, because: What good does a transformation has if it won't be taken advantage of? Completing one of the best ensemble works I've seen since...Well, since ""Mystic River"", Morgan Freeman played his cards once again, narrating and talking wisely to receive the Oscar he should have had over a decade ago for ""The Shawshank Redemption"", were he was splendid.

The way Clint Eastwood has to escape from the obvious (a man who directed lots of westerns, which are pretty obvious), can be seen clearly in all those moments where you're waiting something typical and his camera, or his movie's script, doesn't give it to you. In ""Rocky"", the man trained by himself, and felt proud of that; in ""Million Dollar Baby"", our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer, and besides being proud of, loves him. It's amazing how he loves her back.",9

Scrap (Morgan Freeman) was a retired fighter. He cleaned Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym, and he always saw the good in everyone. Scrap was the one who saw something in Maggie (Hilary Swank) way before Frankie did.

Maggie was a small town girl from southwestern Missouri. She grew up knowing that she would never amount to anything more than trash. All she wanted was someone to believe in her. Even without the approval of her family and others around her Maggie never let go of her dream of being a big time boxer. She always kept her unshakable focus.

Frankie hated taking risks and never allowed himself to get close to anybody. That all changed, however, when he met Maggie. He took a chance and agreed to train her, not knowing that she would win him over. They would both face 'a battle that would demand their hearts and courage' stated by Scrap. They grew to have a strong friendship and found a sense of family in each other that both had lost a long time ago.

As you follow the journey of Maggie and Frankie you will not only grow to cherish their friendship, you will see that the real magic in boxing is 'fighting battles beyond endurance and risking everything for a dream that no one sees but you'! No matter what, always remember the one key rule: ""Always protect yourself."" You will learn what happens if you don't, but only if you go see Million Dollar Baby!",10
14 March 2005,An absolutely terrific film!!!,"I love Clint Eastwood. He is a genius and definitely put together a masterpiece this time. This film is full of realism and drama, yet it is able to captivate the audience and reel them in for an emotional ride. Hiliary Swank owned the screen and owned this role. Bravo! Oh, and it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally put the jinx behind him and bag a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Plot...The movie is basically about a woman who dreams of becoming someone and the road she takes to get there. She ironically teams up with the manager who is notorious for not getting to the big match and gains inspiration from a washed-up fighter who has resorted to cleaning and living in a gym. How does she make her dreams come true. You'll have to see and find out.

20 February 2005,There are no words....,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

18 February 2005,A Great Film,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint Eastwood's best film as a director (at least so far , he's still young at 74).It tops even ""Mystic River"".

The story involves a young trailer park trash woman, wonderfully played by Hillary Swank, who thinks she can become a boxer.She has been waiting on tables for more than half her life, her life is at a total stand still and she has no way to go other than boxing.She comes to Clint Eastwood's gym and refuses to leave and he eventually agrees to train her.Morgan Freemen,excellent as always,plays Eastwood's best friend, former client and janitor and rounds out the cast in this small, three-person drama.

Names you always, always remember from the movies include Hal 9000, Fred C.Dobbs and Marge Gunderson.It's the damnedest thing.What's so unusual about the names ""Marge Gunderson"" and ""Fred Dobbs""? Perfectly ordinary, there are probably many people named that.And yet, I don't recall the names of the main characters from ""Casablanca"" but remember the ones from ""Fargo"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Mountains"".""MDB"" is newest addition to the list.Instead of in labels such as ""the boxer"" ""the trainer"" ""the best friend"",you speak of the characters by name as if they are real people.

For two thirds of its running time, ""MDB"" is a pretty standard rags-to-riches, underdog-triumphs boxing movie and one of the best since ""Rocky"".Then it completely takes another turn and truly finds greatness.It's a masterpiece, pure and simple.

Maggie is paralyzed from the neck down in a fight.She asks Frankie to put her out of her misery.At first, he flatly refuses.After she attempts suicide, he gives in and kills her.

Maggie's decision is wrong.In most cases, euthanasia is morally wrong. If I were in her place, I'd be devastated and maybe suicidally depressed but would learn to live with it.In fact,not being a good dancer or athlete,I might happier in a wheelchair and only occasionally miss jogging,swimming and not having to depend on others for literally everything from wiping my nose to going down the street.As long as I could still go to the movies, I'd be reasonably okay.Some of the most famous people in the world are paraplegics; look at the lives of Stephen Hawking, Christopher Reeve, Christy Brown, Larry Flynt or Muhammad Ali.

But Maggie is a boxer.Being a quadriplegic is a death sentence for her, like being a prisoner inside her own body.She only asks Frankie after she loses her leg.Losing her body is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to her and she doesn't have an educated mind to go on.

There is another reason she does what she does; except for Frankie and maybe Eddie, she's all alone in the world. We meet her unloving family twice, including her selfish, stupid mother. In one great scene, Frankie and Maggie go on a visit to her family.",10
14 June 2007,Riveting! Eastwood Just Gets Better With Age!,"What can I say that almost a thousand other comments haven't said? Clint Eastwood loves his craft. That's why his films are so good. He simply loves what he does........and it shows. He is a simple task-master but it works. What he lacks in talent he makes up for in grit, hard work, love of craft and determination for depiction of the truth in a natural way. He has a knack for simplicity and story-telling that is gripping and satisfying. He picks screenplays that are controversial and revolutionary and that require you as an audience to think and use your brain. He is not just there to entertain, though he always does that in large measure, but also to inform and to provoke one to thought - but rarely does he preach. He chooses themes that are often out of the mainstream, but can engage an audience so thoroughly with the universal emotions that we all share in our daily lives that he galvanizes large audiences into reactions that are at once massive but at the same time diverse in opinion. And that is precisely what Clint does here with great success. He does not give you a ""right or wrong"" to it. He just puts it on a platter for you to try it out and see for yourself what you think. I love Clint as an artist and so do many other people. This is a great film. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman fit into their roles beautifully and Clint looks good too. Hilary and Clint do magic together on screen.

Get this film and own it today. Watch it often and Enjoy! One of the Best Films ever made and perhaps Clint's finest!",9
8 August 2005,"Eastwood does a good job with drama, great story, great actors","I thought Eastwood impressed once again. A solid drama, with an inspiring story, good direction, great acting and amazing score. The script about a female boxer (Swank) who trains with an experienced trainer (eastwood) as told by an old fighter(Freeman) who lost his eye in a fight who works for the trainer at his gym . I thought Morgan Freeman outshined in this film, his performance, although supporting, was better than both of the leads. I liked Hilary Swank she was solid, and although Eastwood had the same look throughout most the film his performance was decent as well. Jay Baruchel was hilarious, great character. I thought this film was good, it was slow but got its point across, a great drama. 9/10

21 February 2005,Perfection,"I know perfection is a hard thing to achieve... some may argue that it's impossible... maybe, but this movie is one of the closest things you can get. Eastwood is like a good port wine, or a good scotch whiskey, it get's better as it ages. Far from the cold hard look of it's Dirty Harry or Sergio Leone's westerns, Clint has become a man with a very personal and always emotional view on human relations. From the wonderful Oscar-winning Unforgiven, to the beautiful Bridges of Madison County or the powerful Mystic River, Clint Eastwood always shows us a human story with some unresolved, deep, old wounds from the past that haunt the characters throughout the entire movie. And he is always able to touch the most inner feelings of ourselves. Million Dollar Baby is probably it's most accomplished movie. Great actors, great script and a master's touch make a must see for everyone. You will stand up in cheer and like someone close to me once said ""You'll want to shout it's the greatest movie of the last ten years, even if it isn't true"".

12 February 2005,Better than Mystic River,"This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was a women version of Rocky.But boy oh boy I was wrong this movie was hands down the greatest Picture of 2004.Clint Eastwood directing has improve so much I mean this is his best work yet and he deserves a lot of credit.Even his acting his good I mean some people lose it but not him he still knows how to deliver those lines. Hillary Swank OMG I the last time she was this good was Boys Don't Cry, I mean the way she was so tough in this film really brought motivation to me. Morgan Freeman still know how to be a great narrator. THe chariter he plays has such a sad story but yet wonderful(But then again all the charioteers in this movie have a story to tell that told about their 15 minutes of fame. The 15 minutes that made them die happy.).All I have to say is thank good this movie isn't going against LOTR this year now this year Clint Eastwood has a fair chance.I'll say one thing about this film I don't care if your a guy or girl your going to walk out of that movie with a tear coming down from your eye because your going to learn how fair people will go just so they can say I had my 15 minutes of fame and thats all I wanted.

25 April 2017,A Masterpiece,"Million Dollar Baby (2004)

Plot In A Paragraph: A determined woman (Hilary Swank) works with a hardened boxing trainer (Eastwood) to become a professional.

This movie is a masterpiece. End of.

Whilst Eastwood picked up two Oscars for directing and the movie itself, I feel Clint also should have won for his acting here too!! Though it's close with Jamie Foxx in Ray!!

Everything is spot on with this movie. From the cast, both Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deservedly won Oscars for their work here. The score which was composed by Eastwood himself (instead of usual collaborator Lennie Niehaus) is gorgeous. This is the first Eastwood movie in over 20 years not to be composed by Niehaus.

This was the first time since the movies release that I have rewatched it. I went to see this movie in the cinema two days after my sister died. I'd read reviews calling it Frocky etc and expected an upbeat, inspirational movie. I did not see the gut wrenching twist coming at all. I sat in the cinema sobbing!!

Million Dollar Baby became Clint's third movie to hit the $100 million mark (and his first In over a decade) as it ended the year the 24th highest grossing movie of 2004.",10
22 February 2005,"""Do not confuse this one with ""Rocky""!","This movie is definitely one of the best, if not the best picture(s) of 2004, and probably one the best pictures I have ever seen! This film is surely one of Clint Eastwood's best pictures ever! The chemistry between the powerhouse talents of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank is just extraordinary to say the least! This movie is so full of purpose until it hurts! One of the major components for me in this movie is the fact that it targets boxing from the women's perspective, showing that women's boxing is truly no different than men's boxing just in gender! Hillary Swank gives an unforgettable performance, and in my eyes is a shoo in come Oscar time! A must see for boxing fans and Oscar-caliber film fans alike!

28 January 2006,A heart wrenching surprise...,"Didn't expect to like this movie. It was an unexpected and rare treat, a movie I expected to be like many other ""boxing"" films. It's still with me, weeks after seeing it.

What makes this film stand above most others is that it could be anyone's story, just interchange the dream, the guilt, or the focus of hindsight. And because its anyone's story, its stellar. Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood are at there believable best. Morgan Freeman ""supports"" the story, Swank, and Eastwood with subtle finesse. One significant let-down; what happened to Billie? I thought we deserved to know.

Grabs you where few movies reach. Haunting.

2 August 2007,"Million Dollar Baby, the best film of 2004!","Clint Eastwood won his second best directing Oscar and his second Best Picture Oscar with Million Dollar Baby which was not only his best film since Unforgiven, but it's a lot better than Mystic River.

Million Dollar Baby is not about boxing, but about the characterization of three characters and the struggles that they face in the boxing ring.

With films like Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven, Flags of Our Fathers, and of course, the best picture nominated Letters from Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwood continues to prove that not only is he one of the most iconic American actors in history, but that he had the tenacity and courage to leave his western image behind to become one of America's best directors of all time. His craft will be remembered for generations.

Winner of four 2004 Academy awards, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor.",10
24 January 2005,"Maybe, ""Thousand Dollar Baby?""","I see more than 100 movies a year in the theaters, and with all the over-hype of this, I expected something truly great. Well, if you read through all these reviews, it'll explain the plot, so I won't waste time and re-do it, but I will say this...this film is a major disappointment. Considering Eastwood's last, great film, Mystic River, I expected something in that caliber. There is nothing in this film that holds up to Mystic. No, this film is not a complete loss, it does have good moments, but no great, or significant moments. It's all huff and bluff, but nothing more. The performances are fine, but not spectacular. And the script has to be one of the poorest scripts of a major film this year. It is juvenile and amateurish and far from the caliber Eastwood should be working with. It takes from classic great films like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Shawshank' to name a few, but adds nothing to them and can't even match the brilliance of either of those truly classic films. Eastwood should have known better, but this is obviously a director out of his league and not fully comprehending what he wanted to do or say. When the narration fails under the weight of the great Morgan Freeman, you know you are in trouble. Swank does well, but her role is not terribly complex. I think back to the great Imelda Staunton, in 2004's Best Film ""Vera Drake"" .Now that was great acting!! And a truly great film. This film will receive a lot of Oscar noms and probably win some, but it's a sad commentary when a film like this is so over-rated and people seem to buy into it. Roger Ebert called this, the best film of the year, but he, like so many others, seem to be star struck and not really paying close attention to details, script, plotting or what is on the screen. I liked this film, well enough, don't mis-understand me. I'd give it a ""B"" on a scale from A-F. But ""B"" is hardly what I expect from Eastwood, and far from what I expected reading all these over-praising reviews. I have the real sense that many viewers, who listen to the hype, will leave the theater sad, disappointed, and wondering what all the chatter was all about. So do I.",
12 July 2005,2004's Best Picture Masterpiece,"Today I finally had the pleasure of watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD and I got to tell you that this is one of best boxing films and also the greatest Clint Eastwood film ever made at the same time.

The film concentrates on the principal actors Clint Eastwood as the trainer, Morgan Freeman as the Narrator and friend, and Hilary Swank as the woman who wanted out of her old life to be a boxer, in which we get to study these look at these characters as human beings rather than just actors playing a part.

Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a former professional boxer and trainer who runs a local boxing gym with his buddy Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) in which Jimmie knows the ropes on how to fight, how to move and how to win. In the prologue of the film, we see Frankie trying to heal a scar from a boxer before the boxing doctor comes to check. The character of Frankie Dunn doesn't have faith in the people he trains, after in a scene he tells the boxer that he doesn't want him to fight to get the title or else he'll get hurt; especially when Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) tries to come in and box at the gym, he tells Maggie that he doesn't train girls because it will look bad on his reputation.

Maggie Fitzgerald has always dream of becoming a boxer as she attends every fight event that takes place in order to talk to Frankie, but he refuses to train her because she is too old. It doesn't stop Maggie as every day and night she trains at the boxing gym where Eddie gives out advice and tells her how to posture her movement. She doesn't quit until Frankie decides to help her. During the prologue of the film, Eddie explains the story behind Maggie as we see her working as a waitress in a dead-end job where she steals most of the leftover food and takes it back to her house where she eats the food.

Eddie is the narrator, and the character that Morgan Freeman portrays is similar to Red Boyle from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in which the character talks about the events that took place especially getting to know the characters a little better. Eddie is blind from one eye as he explains to Maggie that he lost it in his 109th fight when Frankie was his manager; he also lives in the gym where he has a small room near the entrance where he sleeps, eats and watches TV. Like Frankie, Eddie takes in a poor retard from the streets named Danger Barch (Jay Baruchel) in which the retard has dreams of winning the championship title; though the kid may never have a chance, Eddie will believe in him.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is more than your ordinary boxing flick; it's also a character movie where we get to know these three characters and actually have feelings for them as we root them on. I was cheering when I watched this film as I watch the character Maggie win all the fights, including having a smile on my face when we saw Maggie and Frankie talking during a road trip. The last forty minutes of the film is a sad tragedy as we lose one of the main characters of the film; it is truly a great and powerful scene.

Last year I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" a tragedy about three men and the nightmare that came back to haunt them; that was one of the best films I've ever seen from a Clint Eastwood movie; now after watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD, Clint has completed his tragedy masterpiece where I will never forget that people do have chances in life.",10

It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

12 August 2005,What a disaster!,"One of the biggest disappointments this year. After all the buzz and 5 Oscars I expected some really huge impact on me & a very strong story. Well, right from the beginning I was asking myself ""Oh my, this is REALLY the best movie of the year???""... Maybe I'm dull, but I cannot see anything new in the film, on the contrary. God, we've seen so many scenes so similar to this, that I couldn't believe that ""such a director"" as Clint Eastwood directed it! Why did Hilary win the prize? She did nothing, again, but some boxing, speaking with Southern-American accent and lying in bed!!! Is this worth an Oscar? You know, I'm quite convinced that if it hadn't been for Eastwood sitting on the director's chair, all the critics would have been very negative and no-one would have appreciated this film. For me it's nothing but cliché plot and dialogs seen thousand times before, with no profound meaning or message. Sorry guys.

15 July 2013,Absolutely brilliant... one of the best Eastwood films.,"MILLION DOLLAR BABY

Wow... this is a great film. I am not surprised that it won 4 Oscars, 2 Golden Globes, 2 Screen Actors Guild Awards and 10 other awards from various institutes.

The story is about a guy who lives and works in a gym. All through the film you are hearing what he is seeing. He is seeing a tough trainer refusing to train a girl, all because she is a girl. The journey the three of them take together is a real roller coaster. I really can't explain more than that without posting spoilers.

The story is so touching and emotional. I have been sitting here staring at this screen for about 10 minutes not knowing what to type. This film really has left me speechless.

At first I thought it was going to be Rocky with a female. But it was nothing like it. Yes there was boxing and training, but in a completely different way.

Now, it seems a boxing film can't be made realistically. Every boxing film I have seen just can't quite make the boxing look real... unfortunately it is the same with this one. I watch a lot of boxing and it is all about skill and technique. But in these movies it seems it is all about getting your butt kicked until you all of a sudden win with one punch. There were bits in this film where one boxer in particular did some underhanded moves... if that happened in real boxing the boxer in question would have been disqualified straight away... but not in this film. It is a shame, but I also understand that the film makers are trying to make the film more interesting. I do still love boxing movies... the Rocky movies are classic (except for part V... terrible!), and they are not very realistic either.

The acting was absolutely brilliant. The casting was perfect. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman star in this. And if Clint wasn't busy enough, Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Clint Eastwood & Original Music by Clint Eastwood. The man is a legend.

There is so much I want to talk about here... but I can't really because it will give to much away.

I will give this film 8 out of 10.

A very strong story and a very strong performance.

23 January 2005,I don't understand how come the Aviator won Best Pic. at Golden Globes...,"after seeing Million Dollar Baby. Well what can I say, the Aviator left me cold, and so much emotion comes out of MDB. I loved that movie, and all the people around me loved it too. I haven't cried so much in a long time, and when I turned around to look at my boyfriend, well it was the Niagara. Go see it. Great story telling, great acting.... Everything about that movie is breath taking...

If it doesn't win an Academy award, I will really be surprised. It's been at least 2 hours since I came out of the movie theater and I'm still moved by it. Certainly hope that Hilary Swank wins another Oscar for her performance.

3 November 2011,Good but definitely not without its flaws.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

9 March 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"Clint Eastwoods latest movie Million Dollar Baby have been awarded in the Oscars. What more to say. I've seen all of Clint Eastwood movies whether he directed it or in which he acted in it himself. This particular movie evolves around a boxing center where all boxing champions wanna be are training their butts off in pursuing their dreams, there are exceptionally a few funny moments in this movie but the main character comes with Hilary Swank as the main focus. Quite long semi heavy drama; but worth watching. Could have been cut short but hey, its not my movie. Overall a good movie to watch. Makes you understand more on human nature and how to deal with it when it comes and should it come. Indirectly, its just another story of a trainer, apprentice, manager in boxing center and going through a boxing match championship with a twist of gender in between. Not quite the ending one would expect in any movies watched. Kudos to Clint Eastwood for his million dollar baby.

3 February 2007,A Masterpiece,"Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece. This is Clint Eastwood's best movie. Hillary Swank won an Oscar for Best Actress, Morgan Freeman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and Clint Eastwood won two Oscars one for Best Director and Best Picture. This movie also has some humor in it. This movie was well directed by Clint Eastwood. I cannot wait to see Flags of Our Father and Letters from Iwo Jima. This movie was nominated for Best Actor - Clint Easwood, Best Film Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay. Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest directors. I almost own every movie he directed. Clint Eastwood makes some great westerns. Thank goodness Clint Eastwood has not died yet.

27 February 2005,Glad I Changed My Mind!,"I wasn't going to see this film - I thought I could wait until its DVD release. THEN, my aunt came over and raved about it. I was so curious that I went out the very next day and saw it.

Million Dollar Baby is an amazing story and I really liked it. I just think Hilary Swank can pick a winner of a script when she sees one! She may not be Hollywood's top actress, or even in a lot of films - but the ones she does appear in are awesome! I am only 21 years old, and usually right into comedies and the like, but this is a movie that I will definitely see again. I cried.

I rated this film 9/10 - but it may be even better than that. Don't think twice about going to see it! I almost did!!

16 February 2005,Down for the Count,"O.K. Boxing leaves me cold or maybe I should say - usually boxing leaves one of the boxer's cold. I'm not trying to be facetious but Clint Eastwood took a theme which is totally improbable yet I found it interesting and moving. For most of the movie, I found the plot well developed, the characters interesting and the grimy background believable. And what do you know, that girl can punch - one wallop and down they go until one day, down she went. And so did the movie. If the movie would have ended before the lengthy hospital scenes, I would have walked out and thought, well she did what she wanted to with the help of a moody, guilt ridden manager. He really overdid ""moody"" but hey, this is a movie. Now to get to the sad part and it was sad, sad. He was sad, she was sick and sad. Her folks were especially sad since no more money was forthcoming. Anyway, as the sun sets in the west, the movie sank lower and lower into despair until the end. And so the moody manager vanished into the night, or did he?

6 February 2005,Nothing But Raw Emotions Could Have Painted This Story,"You will go away thinking these particular lead actors could have hit your reset button, and there would have been nothing you could do about it. Eastwood and Freeman give no quarter. Swank is unspeakably in the moment. In smaller parts, Jay Baruchel as 'Danger Barch' and Lucia Rijker as 'Billie 'The Blue Bear'' are both heroic in total synch with this equally go-for-broke work.

When I first heard of this movie I was ready to complain that Eastwood hadn't cast a Latino as lead. What an obvious opportunity missed! A few seconds later I realized: I can't grumble about Eastwood, he's way too high on my, and so many other people's, list. I would see the movie and not say a word. Now, after seeing this movie, I realize I would have never lived my rash remarks down.

One day, hopefully many years from now, Eastwood will die, and I am quite sure his funeral procession will be the biggest thing to ever hit Hollywood. This guy has done more for the movie industry than any dozen movie moguls. We're really very lucky. Go see his latest effort and tell me I'm wrong.",
19 January 2005,Worthy - perhaps overly-so and very Americanised in its self conscious protesting of valuable issues,"Million Dollar Baby

Million Dollar Baby 7/10 Hilary Swank, as she did in Boys Don't Cry, has transformed herself physically for the part. Emotionally, intellectually, physically and - in terms of determination - spiritually, she *is* the character, and it's a stunning achievement. (She plays an underprivileged girl who wants to succeed as a boxer and eventually persuades Clint Eastwood to coach her.)

Sadly, while it's an undoubtedly well (enough) made film, the directing, and acting elsewhere, is to my mind hardly of the calibre to justify the accolades the film is receiving generally. America, if not many other Western audiences, have become so inured to that self-congratulatory style where the camera zooms in for a close up and the actor holds an expression slightly longer than necessary for that 'Oscar moment'. These audiences, in my opinion, should get out more to some good traditional French cinema and see how lacking such Hollywoodized performances are compared to the European tradition of acting in a more 'natural' and believable way.

Another reason for the over-hype on Million Dollar Baby, is probably because the themes towards the end of the film (without giving too much away) now firmly belong to the almost trendy political left wing liberalism that many like to embrace. Whilst possibly putting myself in that camp, I am not in this case convinced that the way it is dealt with here justifies the extravagant kudos the movie has acquired over its more cinematic merits. I can only give it 7/10, but if I were in America (USA) I'd probably give it more, simply because it may have some good socially effect in that morally moribund and religiously intolerant country.

Million Dollar Baby is a very good film, but over-long and too full of it's own self-importance for my taste.",7

2 February 2005,Knocks you flat...,"The best way for one to enter the viewing experience of this movie is to read nothing about it first. But since that is impossible for most people- I know I can't pay $9 for a movie ticket without at least getting a feel for the critical waters, I will do as best I can to summarize what I feel is the movie deserving of all of the major Oscar categories, even if the criminal snubbing of Martin Scorcese has to continue for yet another year.

Million Dollar Baby is a film that will put you through a wringer of emotions that will make you feel like you've been in the boxing ring yourself. Although Unforgiven is still, in my opinion, Eastwood's masterpiece in film-making, MDB is definitely going to be Clint's twilight opus. Although the man isn't exactly on death's door, there are only a limited number of films left in him. And if this is the last film he ever makes, then he has certainly gone out with a bang.

I guarantee you- if you see this film, you will be genuinely touched and moved. None of the actors- Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, and even Clint Eastwood himself, have been better. If anything, a film such as Million Dollar Baby has served to remind me what a dull and lonely world we will be in when great filmmakers and actors like Freeman and Eastwood are no longer among us, just as the world became less lively and funny when Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthou left us.

I apologize that this review is not more specific. It is because the most profound experiences I've had in movies came only when I knew very little about what I was about to see. All you need to know is this is a truly moving story about the human condition. That Clint Eastwood has made a film that will make you think about how you view certain issues, and should at the very least give you pause. That the characters in Million Dollar Baby are ones who will stay with you for a very long time, and that you will never forget them. And when the end credits start to roll, you will wonder how 137 minutes could go by so quickly.",10

15 August 2006,Eastwood's 2nd Best,"Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a long-in-the-tooth boxing manager and trainer who is too timid to allow his pupils to pursue the championship. As soon as Dunn loses his last protégé, along comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in her second Best Actress Oscar victory) into his gym, determined to be Dunn's next and first female boxer. After some nudging from his gym's janitor/companion and the film's narrator Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman, winning his first Oscar for a sub par performance), Dunn reluctantly takes young Maggie under his wing and finds the best fighter he's ever helped. From this point, I can't say too much more due to a major plot twist, but the film as a whole is a perfect example of the typical formula for a Shakespearean drama. Once again, my favorite scene is because of Eastwood's performance, about 15-20 minutes from the end, when the tough Dunn breaks down into tears in front of his priest, desperate for a perfect solution he ain't gonna get. Half a star is held back thanks to a pile of clichés like Maggie's pit bull of a final opponent, the bully of the gym getting his at the end, and Freeman narrating (sooo Shawshank). Besides that, holy McCuishle! If anything at all propels M$B into classics territory, it's the second act.",9
6 March 2005,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"I am an avid fan of boxing, being an amateur boxer myself... I am drawn to boxing, I must say I was a little hesitant seeing a movie about a female boxer but I left the movie theater breathless... This is absolutely one of the BEST movies I have ever seen, Clint Eastwood has a true gift for bringing movies to the screen that have a story to it.

Even if you are not into boxing, I would recommend this movie to anyone. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Hilary Swank had stellar acting positions in this movie... I am glad I got to see this movie and am glad to have wrote a comment about it...

I give it a 10 out of 10 =)

21 January 2005,Clint Eastwood's Best Movie Ever!,"Van Gogh had ""Starry Night"", DaVinci had ""The Mona Lisa"", and now Clint Eastwood has ""Million Dollar Baby"". At first glance this movie seems like a typical boxing movie. This movie runs much deeper than your typical ""sports movie"". Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie, an aging fight manager, who runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles. Frankie goes to church daily for sins that are not quite known. With Frankie is his friend ""Scrap"", a former fighter that is blind in one eye, that has been with Frankie for several years. Frankie changes when he meets Maggie, a superb Hilary Swank. Maggie is a 30 something waitress who aspires to be a champion boxer. At first Frankie refuses to train Maggie. But Maggies persistence and attitude gives Frankie a change of heart. Frankie takes Maggie to the top and grows to love maggie. The movie has a lot of boxing scenes, but is more about the longing for family. In just over two hours Clint Eastwood creates a masterpiece of emotion and heart, with an incredible cast, and great dialouge. Clint Eastwood stars, directed and composed the wonderful score for this movie. People may think going into this movie that it might be another ""Rocky"". This movie has one thing a boxer really needs in the ring, a lot of heart.",10
17 April 2005,One of top 10 all time movies,"So Clint You did it, you confirmed yourself again as icon in movie industry and i say thank You from bottom of my hearth for that.

This movie forced me to overview my life again and meet some facts and points where I did or did not pull strong enough to finish my scores and make a goals, where I get and audience and where I get the silence. Immediately after movie finished i was completely empty due losing energy after meeting dirt of today's society again and again, but than i started to boost and rise only hour after when I try compare similar situations from my life with Maggies (so as any of you have). I might can sounds crazy but tomorrow I will work harder than day before only because of watching this movie which effects me as cold shower in a middle of desert.

thank You for this movie one more time Clint and thx You choose all supreme actors to represent Us this wonderful story.

I will not comment any particular scenes cause that would be shame, each one of you will understand all I am talking' when You see the movie, if you not than i have to say: ""No fence but you ain't deserve to watched it it anyway.""",10
14 September 2008,Bad,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",3

18 February 2005,Over-hyped and Overwrought,"""Million Dollar Baby"" takes the well worn boxing genre and turns it into so much mawkish manipulation. Though Hillary Swank gives a great performance, the story is painfully transparent. The use of the omniscient voice-over distracts from what is happening on the screen. Clint Eastwood airs out his limited selection of old catchers mitt expressions and Morgan Freeman is his typecast old self as the wizened presence with a hatful of aphorisms. This film covers no new ground and you might be left with a desire to approach the theater manager about a refund. When a film has the Oscar prognosticators panting only ten minutes after the film has opened, you may have seen a great film, or you may have been sold a bill of goods. If you can remove every boxing film cliché' from your brain before sitting down to watch, ""Million Dollar Baby"" might be the former. If not, carefully fold your money, and go see something with a little more creativity and depth.

20 December 2004,"Age & Craft, Both in Character and Creator","Mr. Eastwood has taken American cinema, both behind and in front of the camera, to places it could not have achieved on its own. From 'Play Misty for Me', to last year's triumph 'Mystic River', his contribution to quality simple tradecraft storytelling is of invaluable measure.

As Frankie, a could have been/should have been trainer, Mr. Eastwood reminds you with startling moments that he began an actor. At a moment when you know anyone, someone, would cry, that the character Frankie would cry, you start to ask yourself 'Is Clint really going to take us there?' He does. And back again.

Now to have his skillful storytelling and performance partnered with Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank, is a treat for all. If you began to think that Ms. Swank had lost her verve, or that painful ability to swagger in an out of strength and pathos, then it will certainly be revived by this performance.

The story takes a direction you do not expect. Many a director, particularly American directors, would take thirteen minutes to peak and close out this twist of tale so as to end the film within a perfect three-act structure. But not Mr. Eastwood.

I was reminded of 'The Iceman Cometh' or 'Nights of Cabiria' in that the film plays itself in three equally paced, toned, acts. But never when watching are you aware of this. The transition between banter and voice over and underdog and glory and pain and mystery are kept in check by a lucid austerity of a director who knows what he is looking at. A director who knows how to tell a story.

This is a painfully dull year in film. Ray is a showboat actor's piece. Sideways drags over familiarly executed material a la Alexander Payne. The Aviator; Scorcese is a talented man. Why does he keep after the semi-epic historically significant holiday release material? And where are the female performances for the year? But this is another discussion.

Film? Picture? Director? The best of all categories for this year can be found inside 'Million Dollar Baby'. Morgan Freeman may be due, but will likely not take anything home. Swank, who can say. But I do know, statuette or not, this film is the best place I've gone in cinema this year.",9
2 March 2009,Boxing movie and then some,"I figured this was just heated-up ""Rocky"" but what do you know, it's not. The story seems basic to the naked eye, but it actually turns out to be pretty brilliant once you get halfway or so. This does in fact start out as a true underdog story, and the nobody who becomes somebody out of sheer will power has been done to death. But then you have some more stuff that happens and the whole thing is put in a different perspective. Hillary Swank is pretty good, but this is Eastwood's movie, and not only because he directed. His performance is really intriguing, he's really just close to the stock character of the hard-ass trainer, but he's doing so much with it. And I'm not really much of a fan of presumed emotional highlights but this one really works. Whatever praise it got it deserved it.

13 September 2006,Heart felt to the aortic valve!!!!!!!,"I had this movie since spring and for some odd reason (like some of my books) I have watched bits and pieces of it until I saw it through TONIGHT! What can I really say that hasn't been said and what can I give insight on that is not known about this movie.

Hilary Swank don't really stand out to me from the plethora of actresses except I know she's played some serious roles with tragic endings.

I think she shines beautifully in this, her character is awesome. I don't know what to really say and I am not questioning it, but perhaps due to my thick skin is the reason why I am not sobbing in tears but damn, you have to be heartless to not take this movie to your being.

Many people have nit picked and were very critical in their reviews and comments but such is the world of criticism. But, if you ask me, they're clowns, finding any reason to tear anything down for whatever reason that momentarily soothe their pathological problems because to $h!t on this film shows that their clowns.

I will give a big up to Clint; er-hurmm, Mr. Eastwood for his work because now I see what the hype is all about.

I am one for realism when it comes to movies. The more vivid, the better and it got no better than this for 2004.",10
18 March 2014,"Powerful Story with Strong Performances,","Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a very dramatic movie that tells a very realistic story, there is nothing about it that feels cliché or cheesy, everything that goes right for these characters is because of determination and hard work, and anything that goes wrong, there's literally nothing they can do about it, the character development is superb, they are relatable, they are human. I felt like the movie was, at times, a little overly sentimental, it works for the most part but there are moments were it feels a little forced and that it could have been toned down a little, there should have been more scenes where the characters are genuinely happy in each other's company and there is no real drama, just friendship. The performances are outstanding, a movie like this could never have been good without stellar acting, and the casting here is perfect, Hillary Swank shines in every scene, and an Academy Award was well deserved to both her and Morgan Freeman, who isn't in it as much as Swank or Eastwood, but he steals every scene he has and his narration adds perfectly to the film's tone, and as for Clint Eastwood, this is without a doubt some of his best work as both an actor and a director, his character is flawed, angry, and very real, it seemed to come very naturally to him, all the emotion is evident in both his eyes and speech. Powerful, emotional and superbly acted, Million Dollar Baby is a Best Picture Winner for a reason, and I would recommend it to all moviegoers.

A tough skinned trainer plans to drive a boxer to the top, putting his own skills to the test.

27 February 2008,Million Dollar Baby: one of the BEST movies of all time.,"Million Dollar Baby, I sit here watching it in 2008 and it is still as fabulous now as it was the first time I saw it in 2005. It is my favorite movie of all time: Clint Eastwood does a beautiful score, he is right on the money. The character development is so wonderful. The relationship between Maggie, Scrap, and Frankie is amazing.

It's honest, and moving and sincere. There is no other movie that I love so much. A dear friend of mine is a paralyzed man who had that same glory prior to his accident that Maggie did. The way the movie touches on that is amazing. Maggie's heart and Clint Eastwood's conscious ... The speech she gives to him about ""going home buying a used trailer, deep fryer and some Oreos,"" makes me cry EVERY SINGLE time. It's the beauty in her face, her enthusiasm in working with him. If you don't enjoy this movie and it does not move you: you need to really re-evaluate everything in your life, my friend. The line, ""Yeah this is my fighter..."" Beautiful. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING in MDB is beautiful. It's the best movie, I believe, to have been made in my life time. Thank you Clint Eastwood - for a life time of beautiful movie moments.

4 June 2015,I don't like to watch women fighting,"I just watched it 'cos it was one of the DVDs in a place we were staying at. If it won an Oscar it should be OK was my thinking. Well , that's all it was... OK , much ado about nothing I would say.

The characters were fairly predictable and we've seen the plot a million times, the producers just thought that they could wring some more bucks out of a story because it was a woman in what is traditionally a Man's role.

I can't say I get any pleasure from seeing a girl bashed to a pulp, although, strangely, it causes me no problems when the same thing happens to a guy ... but that's just me I guess.

In the end I managed to look past that issue and what I saw was an ordinary movie with a bit of good acting but nothing that delivered a KO punch. If it's raining outside or if you've done all you have to do in the day, then this movie will pass those final hours before bedtime much more pleasantly than watching the usual menu of crap on the TV.",5

Stellar cast, including God himself. What more can we ask for?
Authentic, genuine acting.
Great story, with sad twists and turns.


Overall, an amazing job well done.

21 March 2023,"Well made, but I'm so not a fan of boxing movies.","I've never been a fan of sports movies - I think probably least of all boxing (well, next to wrestling). So, from the start I knew this was not my kind of movie and I'm not going to enjoy it.

And indeed so, this is so not my kind of movie. It doesn't matter how well the performances from the veteran cast is, it doesn't matter how good the script is, it doesn't matter how well directed the film is... it simply is not my genre of choice and as a result a film that didn't interest me in the least. I find boxing to be a brutal sport and watching it (in film or real life) is not my idea of fun and being entertained.

Hence, my low rating is based on entertainment value (for me). As for the production and performances, yes, it would rate much higher.

30 March 2005,Thanks Clint!,"I've been a fan for a long time. I've always wanted to shake mister Eastwoods Hand. Now I want to hug his neck. I was moved as much or more by MDB than any movie I have ever seen. Hell, I wanted him to win the Oscar for his acting. In My book its the best he has ever done. Wonderful on all fronts! I was touched so much by the emotional impact of the film it literally stayed with me for days. It is an absolute must-see movie. Somehow he got the actors to give the best of themselves also. Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank also gave monumental performances. Thanks again Clint for ALL the pleasure you have brought into my life. This film and you, Mr. Eastwood are a treasure to me.((((hug))))

26 August 2005,Oscar Oscar Oscar !!!!!!!,"From the trailer to the ending, ""Million Dollar Baby"" encompassed everything to deserve an Oscar. Every role was right on and every angle should never be changed for this film to remain PERFECT. Ms. Hillary Swank payed her dues in the ring and I believe that really put her in the mind set of a struggling yet determined older female boxer, which in turn got her her second Oscar. Mr. Morgan Freeman, what can I say but excellent, he never lets me down and always delivers. Mr. Clint Eastwood has made one of the best films of all times with ""Million Dollar Baby"". Everything about this film was excellent. It never let me down and should be viewed by anyone who has never seen it and it will surly change their opinion about the best movie of the new millennium.

22 February 2005,Loved the first four-fifths...,"I expected to love this movie. For a good hour and a half, I was not disappointed. But looking back at it as a whole, I would have to give it only about 7 out of 10.

I loved almost everything up through the title fight. The only exception was the comically stereotypical portrayal of Maggie's family.

I could have handled the melodrama at the end if it had been portrayed more realistically, but instead it came across as manipulative and shallow.

Without exception, though, Hillary Swank is amazing throughout. Her character was a great mix of sweetness and toughness, attitude and humility.

6 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"Million Dollar Baby, is based on the stories in the book Rope Burns by F.X. Toole. The film is about an aging boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn, who works at a gym who one day meets a young woman named Maggie Fitzgerald, who says that she wants to be a boxer and that she wants him to train her. Frankie, doesn't like the idea of training a girl so he says no but soon Frankie, and his friend Eddie, notice that she comes and works out everyday at their gym and soon Frankie, sees how persistent she is and he takes her on as his boxer. They soon also bond together and something happens that brings the characters together in an unforgettable way. Winner of The BSFC Award for Best Actress (Hilary Swank, who plays Maggie Fitzgerald) at The Boston Society Of Film Critics Awards, The BFCA Award for Best Actress at The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, The CFCA Award for Best Director (Clint Eastwood) at the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, The DFWFCA Award for Best Actress and Best Picture at The Dallas Fort Worth Film Critics Association Awards, The FFCC Award for Best Actress at The Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, The Golden Globe Award for Best Director and Best Performance By An Actress In A Motion Picture Drama at The Golden Globes, The Golden Satellite Award for Best Actress In A Motion Picture Drama and Best Adapted Screenplay at The Golden Satellite Awards, The KCFCC Award for Best Actress and Best Film at The Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, The Special Achievement Award for Clint Eastwood for producing, directing and composing the score for the film at The National Board Of Review, The NSFC Award for Best Actress and Best Film at The National Society Of Film Critics Awards, The NYFCC Award for Best Director at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards, The PFCS Award for Best Performance By An Actress In A Leading Role at The Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, The SDFCS Award for Best Director and Best Original Score at The San Diego Film Critics Society Awards, The Seattle Film Critics Award for Best Director and Best Picture at The Seattle Film Critics Award and The USC Scripter Award for the film's screenplay at The USC Scripter Awards. Million Dollar Baby, has good direction, a good script, great performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. Million Dollar Baby, starts off a bit slow and I didn't know if I would like it or not but soon the film became more and more interesting and you could really start to like and care for these characters. And there is a lot more to this story than boxing and sports. It also deals with emotions and things that people actually have to go through like everyday struggles. In telling us this story Million Dollar Baby is intimate, full of emotion, powerful, a good character study, is touching and overall a sweet and tender film. Million Dollar Baby, is one of the best films of 2004 and it will appeal to those even who don't like sports. A truly great film that I hope does well this awards season.",
20 January 2005,Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion,"Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, Million Dollar Baby, is a drama that starts in the boxing ring and ends in the heart. It is a poignant tale about hope, failure, and old ghosts. It is also the best film Eastwood has ever made.

Frankie Dunn is an aging owner of a boxing gym who trains a boxer to the brink of a title fight only to miss a timely opportunity. When an aspiring female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), approaches him for training, he rebuffs her as just a girl boxer and too old at 31 years. Maggie is a waitress whose desire to fight is her ultimate dream as she attempts to make something of her life that has been a rural, backwoods existence. Dunn's best friend, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), takes a liking to the boxer's heart and work ethic, and eventually the two win Frankie over. Frankie's rules are to never question him in training and to always protect oneself in the ring. A slow but gradual learning curve ensues as Maggie becomes a polished boxer who displays a stunning record of wins, mostly by knockouts. Meanwhile, Frankie takes a liking to his protégé and begins to become attached to her. Their relationship is a contrast to his personal demons. His soul struggles with doubt and guilt as he attends church with constant regularity and the letters he sends to his estranged daughter are always returned unopened.

Maggie becomes the focal point of Frankie's world as she attracts boxing matches from top competition which leads to a possible championship in Las Vegas. It is at this point that the story takes a path that is unexpected and startling. It is here that two lives are changed forever and boxing seems trivial in light of subsequent events. And it is here that hard choices and decisions are made.

Based on a group of stories by the late F. X. Toole, Paul Haggis's screenplay is a beauty, filled with memorable dialogue and a story arc that takes its audience on a journey of humanity. The leading cast makes the most of the material. The scenes between Eastwood and Freeman ring true and validate two characters that go way back. Most actors pale in comparison to these two consummate pros at the height of their powers. Morgan Freeman, whose character narrates the story much as he did in Shawshank Redemption, lends strong support. Hilary Swank, who won an Oscar in Boys Don't Cry, is outstanding in a role which required rigorous training while etching a vivid character whose life takes a dramatic shift. Eastwood has always been a solid director and producer. While his early films took advantage of his tough guy image and did not require much thespian range, he filled those roles quite successfully. In recent years, he has grown as director and as a performer by allowing himself some choice dramatic projects (Unforgiven and Bridges of Madison County). But this is without a doubt his greatest piece of acting. He has allowed himself to let go and get to his inner self, and the results are touching and impressive.

As a director, Eastwood has proved with films like Unforgiven and Mystic River that he has a strong, disciplined vision. His work here is most assured and it is very evident that he has matched if not surpassed his previous highs. He is patient and methodical in how he adds layers upon layers of dialogue and scenes to develop his characters into full blooded people. When Maggie approaches Frankie at first, he has no interest in training her, but you know these two will somehow end up working together. Eastwood does not go for easy clichés as she tries to win him over with help from Eddie. Even when he uses tried and true formulas, he does them well. And when Frankie decides to give her a chance, the journey is earned believably. Eastwood's direction is economic and lean. In fact, the pacing is deliberate and there is really no extraneous material (as in earlier good efforts like The Outlaw Josie Wales) to cut or trim. It may be the best job of directing this past year.

Technical categories are strong particularly in cinematography with the darkly lit scenes that add so much to the mood and texture of the moment, and the editing which lends much urgency to the fights and offers unique transitions in the dramatic scenes. (It is interesting that as Maggie ascends to bigger fight venues, the crowds are more affluent and better dressed by the costume department.) Eastwood does a pretty good job of composing some eloquent music. What a multitalented threat he is becoming! There is not much to quibble with this film. Sure, Maggie's white trash family is a bit too stereotypical and one dimensional. We don't get to the bottom of Frankie's family background as much as we'd like. Some of the fights are bloody and violent but not particularly gratuitous or self serving as in Raging Bull.

What ostensibly starts out as a pretty darn good boxing story becomes transformed into a powerful human drama that eschews even its fighting pedigree. Boxing is just a pretext for a much larger canvas. There is the drama of individual struggle and achievement, yet the story aims much higher and raises the ante in tone and direction in ways the audience can't quite anticipate. Eastwood challenges himself and the audience with a story that is not easy and pat. It is a movie that dares to go to areas that are controversial and gut wrenching. While audiences may have a tough time sitting through Million Dollar Baby a second or third time, they sure as hell will be grateful they did just once.

**** out of ****",
16 March 2005,The Characters are Great!,"Do not let anyone tell you that this is not a film about boxing as some critics have said - it is, or at least 85% of it is. But, whether you are boxing fan or not (and I am definitely not!) this is a great film, that is brilliantly acted and directed with the three main characters being stand-outs. Firstly, Clint Eastwood's acting and direction are peerless, while Morgan Freeman brilliantly plays his part in an understated way, but what a performance by Hilary Swank - the Academy had to give her the Oscar. The mood of the boxing game was well-caught, but without giving anything away the last half-hour of this movie is fantastic, and will remain in the memory of all who see ""Million Dollar Baby"". Clearly Eastwood is the premier Director in Hollywood with his great ""Mystic River"" and now this.

5 February 2005,Wow.,"So I see this movie not knowing all too much by previews. Actually from the previews I've seen, I wasn't at all interested. But while in line at the theater, deciding on what to watch, I decided to go with this one. Never seeing an Clint Eastwood movie, I didn't know what to expect. After watching, wow, it was an amazing movie. The performances from all three main actors were superb. Eastwood & Freeman duo was perfectly placed. These two guys are the best of the older actors that are still around. AS for Swank, I don't believe I've ever really cared for any of her movies, good or bad...but this film was great for her. I can't think of another actress that could have filled the slot as perfect as she did. The action scenes, well let me tell you...I've NEVER gagged by watching something from a movie or even on TV, but that nose scene... ANyway, this was an awesome movie, my thumbs are up!

15 March 2005,Stereotyped but fairy tale-like,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9
6 March 2005,A Champion of a movie,"This is paragonless cinematic storytelling. Clint Eastwood plays an aging boxing trainer who reluctantly takes under his tutelage an aspiring female pugilist, played by Hilary Swank. Boxing is just a sub-genre here, providing a platform for a compelling story about life circumstances, human character, and the vagaries of fate. Morgan Freeman, in a near flawless performance, plays Eastwood's sidekick in the management of a decrepit gym. Hilary Swank is brilliant in the portrayal of someone determined to realize a dream against tough odds, and overcome humble beginnings. The pool of characters in this movie is an excellent sample, or so it seems, of the human landscape in modern society. You will relate to one or more of them as they cope with personal demons and jockey for position in the rat race. This, however, is not a reprocessed rags to riches tale a la ""ROCKY"" , as many moviegoers would rather have it, I'm sure. This movie imparts a brutal reminder that there is absolutely no method to the madness of fate, and that in the boxing ring of life, good people are not always the last ones standing. This is as good a film as you'll ever have the opportunity to watch. To say otherwise, I respectfully submit, would be a hopeless attempt at contrariety.

30 June 2005,Best of 2004,"this movie is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The boxing story is very compelling staying away from typical boxing clichés. Good acting by the 3 leads, but the movie gets nearly all of its depth and heart in the second half, imagine that, an original movie, with good performances and a story that is not predictable that keeps you interested till the very end. Also blends humor into this movie that is genuinely...funny! great subplots with the skinny little boxer and the Morgan Freeman character. A feel good movie, a heart warming movie, a gritty movie, and very good movie.

This film blends the two best boxing movies (Rocky, Raging Bull) into one that succeeds in ways that Rocky and Raging Bull could not. Brilliant.

10 February 2005,Clint Eastwood at his best,"I have to admit, I was very skeptical when I first saw the title. I am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood as an actor, but as a director I really liked ""Mystic River"". Well, with this movie, as an actor and director he has reached another level.

This movie should get the Oscar for best film, best lead actor and best lead actress. I haven't seen such a good movie for a long, long time. Hilary Swank is absolutely fantastic. After seeing so many rubbish big productions trying to buy their success through massive marketing campaigns, I was about to lose faith until I saw ""Million Dollar Baby"".

let's be simple: the story is good, the actors are excellent and it's beautifully and intelligently directed. A real treat for anyone who likes good films.

1 November 2007,A sour lesson,"Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint's 27th film at progress in directing. His turnover from that legendary course of bravery in ""Unforgiven"", is now set up in the flat; not charming arena of boxing. But did Clint Eastwood make a movie about boxing? Yes, no. Boxing is the element of desire; uniquely secondary for the movie but primordial to the character of Maggie, to improve on conditions. The lesson moves in a dimmed world, where characters are incomplete and they found in another the way to complete themselves. Eastwood shows his capacity to create credible characters; no dimensional yet dorky and cartoonish heroes. The heroes in ""Million Dollar Baby"" are those we seem to know; but not entirely. The lesson is ""Nothing is beyond you"", yet I find amazing how a very fine script can adjust a story of Frankie's redemption and anger by a lack of communication with his daughter. The film is a calm spectacle of everyday heroes, of great performances (Morgan Freeman with age absorbs perfection) yet a very sour taste. The ending is emotional, but can unbalance the fictional precision that was carried away. Indeed for that, another Academy Award and public award winner.",7
14 January 2005,A masterpiece! Stunning Grace and Love from cranky old coot Clint Eastwood. A miracle!,"This is truly an amazing film. I'd read that it was a masterpiece. That can be an ominous sign, however. You know, one of those dim, fuzzy, dark and depressing movies that critics shove down our throats because watching them will somehow make us more spiritual. Like a 'Watch it and shut up. It's good for you' kind of thing. This was completely different, and wonderfully so. I loved this movie, and so will you.

'Million Dollar baby' IS a masterpiece, but thank God it is also NOT dim or down, and at no moment whatsoever was it in the least 'arty' or 'significant' at all. It is an amazing work of stunning grace and power. It is radiant with Life,Love--- and a shockingly high level of genuine humanity. And to think all of this came from that cranky old coot Clint Eastwood! Sorry,Clint, but you have shown your heart, and your vision, and it is immense. Too late! You will forever be known as a master artist, and a first class human being. I gave this a 10 out of 10, because 'these don't go to eleven'.",10
21 February 2005,Great film,"There's a line in Million Dollar Baby where Scrap (Morgan Freeman) tells Frankie (Clint Eastwood) that if Maggie (Hilary Swank) were to die today, she would die a happy person, because she made it. But he didn't have to say that. It was obvious. The pace of the story and the performances from all three actors tells this so well.

Hilary Swank is amazing as a young woman who has nothing in this world but her own ambition and belief in her dream of becoming a boxer. ""She grew up knowing one thing. She was trash."" was what Scrap had said. Yes, it sounds recycled, like it's been tried before, but from the moment Swank walks on the screen, you believe it. She plays the part so honestly and without over indulgence in sensitivity and emotion. This may be because Eastwood's direction was to tell the story with simplicity and depth.

Once again Eastwood delivers a great story on screen, and his performance as a gritty, old boxing trainer with scars of his own was outstanding. As well was Morgan Freeman's character who's loss was the Championship, and his eye under the direction of Frankie years earlier.

To say that Million Dollar Baby is a heavy hearted film is putting it lightly. But it will stay with you for a few days. And at the end of it you realize just how much of a hero Maggie Fitzgerald is.",10
15 January 2005,Powerful and Deeply Affecting Film,"For a long time, boxing has provided a rich source of material for the movies but this, the most recent film from Clint Eastwood, has to rank among the best.

Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, a small-time boxing manager and gym owner and Morgan Freeman plays Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, an ex-boxer, blinded in one eye during a fight, who works in the gym. The two men are friends and they both feel their glory days have been and gone. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30-something waitress who wants to be a boxer as a way of escaping her daily tedium and poverty.

The film, like all good sports movies, is about much more than the game. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is about people who have seen their dreams vanish and those who are starting to find them. Brilliantly made, with the slow, elegiacal tone of the film frequently punctuated by vicious, bruising boxing scenes, and superbly performed by three great actors at their best. While the film may seem at times a little overlong and slow, this is a very small criticism. It's really powerful stuff with some great performances.

13 February 2005,Masterpiece,"Much of how I rate a film is based on whether or not I, at any moment during the viewing, become conscious of the passage of actual time; that is, that I am actually conscious at any given moment of viewing a movie in a real time-space continuum. If a movie carries me along and causes me, in a fairly complete way, or as completely as possible, to be oblivious to my surroundings, then I believe the story is being told in a skillful and masterful way. You can split hairs over technique and other such minutia, but, the extent of how a movie accomplishes the above determines for me and, I believe, for others how good a film really is.

Million Dollar Baby accomplishes the above for me in a way that no other movie has done; at least in recent memory. There is no doubt in my mind that Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece. Give Clint Eastwood the credit he is surely due. There are a lot of his directorial efforts (at least the ones I have seen which does not include Mystic River)that have been great. But, they have also been in what I like to call the ""almost nearly but not quite hardly"" category.

To coin some boxing terminology, Eastwood goes the distance on this one. I now consider MDB the best movie of all time.",10
14 March 2005,A must see!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
9 February 2005,Million Dollar Movie,"I went to see Million Dollar Baby tonight, and it was incredible. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a Boxing Trainer and Manager who is nearing the end of his career. Frank is plagued with an inability to take risks, which is the Motus Operandi of boxing itself, leaving him with no real accomplishments to take credit for. He is given one last chance at doing something great with his life when he is faced with Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), an aging female wanna be boxer with little trade skill, but a whole lot of heart and natural talent.

I am not a huge fan of Clint Eastwood's earlier films (as a director), I think they are a little too clichéd and Dirty Harry-Esq. But somewhere along the line he managed to take a deep breathe and develop his own style of direction that is absolute art. I used to be only a fan of a movie that had some sort of cleverness about it, now every movie you see tries to be clever in someway. But maybe the cleverness of Million Dollar Baby, is that it doesn't try to be clever.

The artistic direction in Million Dollar Baby is amazing. Clint has grown an ability to transmute the world as we know it into a modern Norman Rockwell painting. Everything piece of set dec in the movie, no matter how torn up or battered it may be... seems to be beautiful. It is like this gossamer shroud of old fashion imagery, draped over the entire set. Clint has Morgan Freeman narrating the movie, and he does just as amazing as in The Shawshank Redemption. Every protaganistic characters seem to have so much honor, and command respect from the viewer, especially when they are held in contrast to the bad guys in the film. It really REALLY makes you root for the main character, and has that much more impact when disaster strikes. Trust me ... you start cheering for Maggie as she beats the crap out of people :D The character development is absolutely amazing in this movie, and possibly it's strongest feature. Clint develops the characters and their relationships so well, that you can feed solely off their body language. There are moments of silence in the movie, and although nothing is being said, you feel as if the characters are still speaking.

I absolutely loved this movie, all performances and characters are awesome. It was very well written and extremely well directed. Go see it. You have 2 days.

Million Dollar Baby - 8.5/10",8
3 July 2006,"Well done, but it's been done before","Million Dollar Baby is a tired story done well. Everything here has been seen before, apart from the last 20 minutes. What makes it different is that everything is done well. The acting is spectacular all around, in fact, it's easy to forget that it's all been done before (though Morgan Freeman's role is too short for Oscar worthiness. Not that it means he didn't deserve the statue.). Clint Eastwood gets every effect and emotion that he can out of every frame. Paul Haggis's screenplay uses the simple grit of everyday life poetically. While there is a very familiar storyline, the plot elements have been used in ways that make them seem fresh. I mentioned that the last 20 minutes is different than what has been seen before. This is true, and I do not want to give anything away. But the rest of the film leaves such an impression that what originality is left has been tainted. Is this an Oscar worthy picture? Perhaps, for the acting and the directing and the writing. But not Best Picture.

18 February 2005,"A true MASTERPIECE. Not really about boxing, but more about relationships.","Mesmerizing -- Ebert is right -- a real Masterpiece. Eastwood is at the top of his game. Anyone that thinks of him as Dirty Harry or that ""Man with no Name"" will not believe how magnificent he is. Great acting job. He doesn't have to ""eat the scenery"" and carry on like some other so-called great actors. Morgan Freeman as always gives a fabulous performance. But it is Hillary Swank who owns this movie. She is clearly the best actress of our day, and if she doesn't win as Best Actress for her performance then I have to wonder about the Academy members who voted. There are not enough adjectives to describe how truly magnificent she is.

I did not sleep too well for three nights after seeing MDB. The movie stayed with me and I almost believed these people and situation to be real.

A MASTERPIECE!

17 February 2005,"Ugh, Eastwood forever Bronco Billy.","Please, please, please Clint Eastwood - go ahead and play piano or make movies about Charlie Parker, but enough with the stupid movies. Case in point, Million Dollar Baby which like Mystic River is overrated junk. Who are the idiots that suck up this crap? Bronco Billy meets boxer meets mystic river surprise ending schlock. You guys watch TOO MUCH REALITY TV. Turn on TCM once in awhile and learn about art and cinema and real film making (e.g. Seven Samuri, Doctor Zhivago). Is it because Clint smokes cigars and was in spaghetti westerns that people hold him on this ridiculous pedestal? I suppose because he proves that he can read a book, talk to actors, and contains his drivel. I certainly hope the Academy has enough sense to bypass it for any gag best picture award! Ick, Double Ick, Get Me Out of This Theater I Can't Take This Crap Anymore.

6 March 2005,Eastwood's Brilliant Film After Mystic River,"This is the story about Frankie Dunn(Eastwood),a boxing trainer who let himself get close to anyone for a very longtime,then Maggie Fitzgerald(Swank) walks into his gym.In a life of a constant struggle,Maggie's gotten herself this far on raw talent,unshakable focus and a tremendous force of will.But more than anything,she wants someone to believe in her.With Frank(Freeman) as Frankie's partner,they face a battle that will demand more heart and courage than any they've ever known.

A charismatic actor-director Clint Eastwood 'back in business' after his glory to make Mystic River won 2 Oscars two years ago.This time,he brings his teammate,Morgan Freeman from Unforgiven and talented Oscar-winning actress Hillary Swank in Million Dollar Baby,a boxing movie such as Girlfight.I should give Mr.Eastwood big applause for his job and his consistency to make a brilliant movie.Swank gives her total performances after the tremendous acting in Boy's Don't Cry.She's very strong,tough,and gives a good personality.Eastwood,Swank,Freeman have big chance to win the Oscar this year.Worth to see,guys !

14 May 2006,Highly respected actors,"I did not know a lot about this movie until I had actually seen it. I knew it starred Eastwood and Freeman and that it had won many Oscars. Boy, was excited. Then it hit me - what a brilliant movie! From its first minutes to the very last scene I was stunned.

The narrator is, and may I say 'of course', Mr. Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors. He has an excellent voice does a very good job as the narrator as well as the former boxer Eddie. 'Million Dollar Baby' is directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood I haven't seen any of his movies before so to me, this was a nice experience.

'Million Dollar Baby' is a touching story and very well-done which makes it to one of the best movies of this decade. Strongly recommended regardless you're a boxing fan or not.

27 February 2007,2004's best...Eastwood's usual...A lessonful masterpiece,"There weren't many contenders for 2004's #1 film spot. People say Sideways was a close first, come on, is that really the movie you want to be watching? I mean, it spelled snobbish all the way through. But Million Dollar Baby is a heartfelt, different side of things and that's what Eastwood likes. An example is his latest, Letters from Iwo Jima. It shows the Japanese point of view in WW2. I really do think that's key. If you run out of ideas for one subject, you take another side and milk it as much as possible. Million Dollar Baby is its own special category. This movie teaches us that ultimately, winners are simply willing to do what losers aren't and that's what screams out a lot in the movie. This film has a lot of heart and pride, and it sure wasn't taken away by the acting or directing of this film. Million Dollar Baby shows the rough side of things to really get the mood going and the mood was set off perfectly. There was remorse, guilt and willingness to do anything all through this film. This film cries out to be understood. Sometimes your family will let you down and sometimes you'll let yourself down but you just roll with the punches life has to offer. There are many punches to this film and this film punched its own ticket to success.",10

17 June 2005,Move Over Rocky ... There Is A New Champ In Town,"The movie follows the life of the woman boxer Maggie Fitzgerald and her coach and manager Frankie Dunn. This movie has elements of comedy and drama. An Astonishing, remarkable and indescribable performance by Hilary Swank, in her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald is too good for words. The emotion that has to be used, to show such courage is talent and is the characteristics of a true actress. Of course you can expect nothing less then great performance by Hollywood veterans Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, its lovely to see that they still have the magic. This movie will make even the hardest rock bleed tears. A must see movie; the story is similar to that of Rocky 1 (Sylvester Stallone) and Philadelphia (Tom Hanks).

7 June 2005,A true triumph of a film...,"Wow, now I haven't seen a film like this in a long time. This movie is all things powerful, endearing, thoughtful, joyful, painful rolled into one. I won't go into specific points or details from the movie to reinforce the above comment; rather, I leave it to you to weave your own appreciative spin on just how gripping this work of art is.

Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman have coordinated in the working of a truly memorable masterpiece with Million Dollar Baby. I've always felt one of the most crucial elements any good film should possess is the capacity to entice the viewer to really give a damn about its characters. Not necessarily love. Nor hate. Just care what happens to them, be they good or bad, or anything in between. Well, this movie made me care. It made me laugh, yearn, cry. Mr. Eastwood, I am now, and always have been your fan. Bravo.

11 March 2005,it's not about boxing...,"this movie uses boxing as a vehicle to address our human-ness, love, hurt, guilt, decisions, desires. the boxing scenes were great. i'm not a boxing fan, but i felt her drive and her passion. Swank is completely believable as a boxer and deserving of her Oscar. Eastwood's direction is engaging, the pacing of the movie was just right. The cinematography, camera movement and Eastwood's choice of lighting and sound (or lack of) was right for the movie's subject matter and tone. the silence in the film carries with it a lot of meaning and creates a space where the viewer can pull back from the movie for a second to reflect on the character's feelings and thoughts which gives the movie a lot of depth. Definitely a must-see... definitely Oscar worthy.

13 February 2005,Most powerful movie ever,"""Million Dollar Baby,"" should have a category warning: this movie contains subject matter that may be too powerful for your average, literate viewer to watch, no matter what their age. When I saw ""Mystic River,"" I was amazed, and touched by it; however, I had read the book, so there were no surprises. After seeing ""Million Dollar Baby,"" today, I am compelled to admit that I have never left a movie in a state of shock. The irony of this film was so overwhelming and the message that it sent was so intense that I was almost unable to leave my seat when it was over. Never before have I seen the use of foreshadowing that was so refined that even when I thought I could predict the outcome of the story, I was wrong. If everyone connected to this film doesn't win an Oscar then the system no longer works. Hilary Swank could give Meryl Streep a run for the money. Clint Eastwood has surpassed Hitchcock when it comes to the element of surprise and story telling. Eastwood and Freeman were so finely tuned the score was hardly recognizable. And the title not only summed up the movie brilliantly but at the same time, bordered on being a misnomer. All I need now is to take a long recovery nap and then attempt to appreciate every day to the fullest. When this movie is released on DVD it should come with a set of emotional steak knives.",10

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

20 January 2005,boxing and fighting,"This excellent film is set in the world of boxing, yes, and sure enough it is about fighting - against oneself, against the restrictions of background, against prejudice and preconception. It links with Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN in being about that too - forgiving yourself, not forgiving yourself, forgiving but not forgetting. The screenplay, which is mostly wonderful, has one or two moments, that's all, of clunkiness, in which it feels just a little bit consciously contrived. The only reason I mention it is because nothing else does feel contrived. The rest has the inevitability of the very best drama. Swank is magnificent. The film is superbly directed - the man is indeed a master. Just one example: think of all the overuse that slow-mo gets in movies today, and in previous movies set in the ring. In this movie there is only one moment where it's used, and of course its power is tremendous because of the general restraint. Go see.

30 January 2005,Boxing film fails to deliver knockout punch,"Clint Eastwood's role as boxing trainer Frankie Dunn is by far the best thing about ""Million Dollar Baby"". His gruff, gravelly portrayal gives the film its heart and soul. He earns our sympathy for his character, without lapsing into cloying sentimentality.

As boxer Maggie Fitzgerald, Hilary Swank is limited by the narrow range of her role to giving a one-note performance. I was not convinced that her character had sufficient motivation to escape the confines of her life as a waitress. Swank is more believable in her response to her trailer-trash family. She is generous and well-intentioned at first, hurt when her generosity is not appreciated, and incensed when she finds out what vultures her mother and siblings really are.

Margo Martindale is excellent as Maggie's mother Earline. She strikes exactly the right note in both of her scenes as a woman who cares more about welfare payments than the welfare of her flesh and blood.

As washed-up boxer Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris, Morgan Freeman serves as little more than a chorus in this modern Greek tragedy. His voice-over provides expository material. In other words, Freeman tells us what the film should show us. This kind of exposition is deadly in a film, the opposite of what good screen writing and good cinema should be.

""Million Dollar Baby"" earned Clint Eastwood an Oscar nomination as best actor and best director. He richly deserves the acting nod, but his directorial skills on this film are open to question.

Eastwood's craft gets in the way of the story instead of helping it along. The music in the final reel is too syrupy and saccharine. Too many scenes are cloaked in shadow, as if to remind us symbolically of the darkness that lurks in men's souls.

A well-crafted film is one where the craft is seamless and invisible. When we become overly conscious of the director's (or actor's) craft, it becomes obtrusive and distracting. It keeps us from entering the world of the film, being enthralled by the story told.

This flaw prevented me from buying into ""Million Dollar Baby"". The film did not move me, or draw me into its human drama, but left me a cold, distant bystander, an observer. ""Million Dollar Baby"" failed to deliver a knockout punch. I ended up feeling suckered instead.",

9 January 2005,Definitely Should Be A Contender For An Award,"Although I am a fan of Clint Eastwood, as well as his son, Kyle, who I saw in one of Clint's movies back when he was a kid and who wrote some of the music for this movie, I was hesitant about seeing this movie because I have never been a fan of boxing.

But, I decided to go see the movie, anyway, mostly for the story revolving around the boxing, instead, and was glad I did.

The interaction of the characters was deep as they learned many of life's lessons from each other as well as ""about"" each other.

I was also glad to see Clint Eastwood's granddaughter have a cameo in the movie (she's the little girl holding the dog at the gas station when Hillary Swank smiles and waves at her and she smiles and waves back).

They also touched base on euthanasia, which I have had dealings with in the past and have supported for many years.

All in all, I think Clint Eastwood has made another jewel that is highly deserving of whatever awards it can win.",
10 January 2005,Clint Eastwood better win,"Hopefully people will see that Clint Eastwood deserves an Oscar for his directing of Million Dollar Baby. And hopefully he wont get jipped like he did for Unforgiven and Mystic River. Even though people may think Martin deserves it because he hasn't won an Oscar yet but i still think that Clint Eastwood deserves it just as much. He has directed a lot of great movies that he never got the proper recognition for. Million Dollar baby was a great movie, very inspirational and many people deserve at least an Oscar nomination such as; Hillary Swank for her great acting definitely one of her best films and of course Mr. Morgan Freeman who shows why he is considered such a great actor who was also shafted for his acting in Shawshank Redemption(Tim Robbins also got shafted) Great Movie.

3 June 2005,A Million Dollar Film,"When going into see Million Dollar Baby, I was expecting a film similar to that of the awesome Rocky saga. I was very surprised by this film that shows the rise and unfortunate end to the career of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress suffering from poverty. Swank and supporting actor Morgan Freeman definitely earned their Oscars, and I was happy to see Million Dollar Baby shut down The Aviator for Best Film. Clint Eastwood got the award for director, sorry Scorsese! The only part of this film that kind of disgusted me was watching Clint Eastwood cry. Dirty Harry does not cry! It was the perfect part for Eastwood, but unfortunately for him, Jamie Foxx pulled off a career ice breaker in Ray, leaving him without the little gold guy.

6 February 2005,Incredible.,"I have never loved Clint Eastwood more than I do after seeing this film. Frankie Dunn is a beautiful character, played with grace and insight by Eastwood. I positively fell in love with his character through the movie. Hillary Swank glides in and out of the film. Her acting sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you are in awe of her. Morgan Freeman is stunning. I felt that this was his best part since The Shawshank Redemption. The entire cast is phenomenal.

The fact that Eastwood not only starred in the film, but produced it, directed it, and composed the music for it blows my mind. There were so many subtle moments where I savored every second as it was unfolding. This film was truly a work of art. Pay attention to the lighting. Every flicker of pain and intensity in Eastwood's clear blue eyes is accented by the lighting. Every grimace, every line on his face speaks to his character. The story simply cannot be done justice with words. My vote for Best Picture of 2004 goes to Million Dollar Baby.",10
26 March 2005,God Bless Clint Eastwood!,"And i don't even believe in God! I think MDL was powerful. It was a movie that moved u without being too dramatic. And thats the beauty of this movie. Hillary Swank is an acting diva. She is one of the best actresses of this era. Clint Eastwood does a lovely job as Frankie.But more importantly he is one helluva director. he deserved not one but two Oscars for it. Morgan freeman is the best actor in the world. He never disappoints. The screenplay is really slow...but thats is to suit the style of film-making. The use of lighting in the movie really helps set the atmosphere required. And the world of boxers and their trainers is portrayed with complete justice.Dialogues are short, crisp and hard hitting.One of the best movies made in the past few years. God Bless Clint Eastwood.

14 January 2007,Surprisingly Great.,"I did not know what to expect when I first pressed play. Maybe I thought it was kind of overrated by the reviewers. But quite fast I sensed something special about it. It is not a boxing movie or a girl-power-Hollywood-waste-of-time kind of movie. It is really a beautiful movie about simple, yet strong things such as: Bravery, determination, hope, trust, compassion and the greatness of giving it one last chance. the last 30 min or so, are very strong and surprising and leaves you with a feeling inside that tells you that this is not just an average movie. To those of you who have not watched it, go ahead and enjoy a special powerful movie, with a good performance by the young Swank, a powerful and worthy performance by the great Clint Eastwood, both as director and actor. And of course a sparkling great performance by our very own Morgan Freeman.

29 May 2010,"Clint Eastwood Shines, Hilary Swank Does Her Thing","I'm not the biggest fan of this movie. It's like many other sports films: the underdog tries to make it big. But the beauty of this film is in Clint Eastwood. Like his later role in ""Gran Torino"", he plays an older man set in his ways and somewhat prejudiced who loosens up and becomes a hero of sorts. Morgan Freeman is also great, but when isn't he? Hilary Swank is not one of my favorite actresses, but she played this role well and I cannot see anyone else doing it. Someone mentioned that Sandra Bullock (for example) would have killed this role and therefore the movie. Absolutely right.

There was much to like in this one, like the featherweight who wanted to be the champion... but as well as it held my attention and was well-paced and acted, I wouldn't say it was a masterpiece. Clint Eastwood is a fine director, but for me he didn't get the power out of this one that he did with ""Torino"".

2 January 2011,Perfect,"Clint Eastwood is simply a master, and of all his directorial achievements, this for me is the sweetest of the bunch. A film adapted from a short story and fleshed out to be something so much more incredible, and which blindsided everybody as a great deal more than ""just another sports movie"". The story is told with so much cinematic swagger it should be illegal; it is perfectly paced, with not a frame wasted.

Clint and Morgan Freeman work as well as two masters should, to the extent that you could watch every scene with just them and simply enjoy the banter of the characters they create. Hilary Swank impresses, and together with ""Boys Don't Cry"", this performance shows that when given the chance, she can go toe-to-toe with the best and stand her ground.

The whole thing is beautifully played out; it is intelligent, surprisingly emotional, and finds its way into your heart. Literally a perfect film.",10

6 February 2005,M$B is a Must See Movie,"After seeing M$B I can say this is more than just a boxing movie. Hilary Swank, who won a Best Actress Oscar five years ago in ""Boys Don't Cry"" plays a woman named Maggie who at age 30 wants to be more than just a waitress and takes up boxing. Thats where she meets Frank played by Clint Eastwood who owns a boxing gym. She also meets Frank's longtime friend/partner ""Scrap"" played by respected actor Morgan Freeman who works at the gym. In one of the more touching moments in the film, Maggie offers to walk Scrap home at closing time, Scrap stops and turns his head to tell Maggie he is home as he lives at the gym in a room not much bigger than a closet. Watch Hilary Swank's marvelous performance as she is odds on favorite to capture her second Oscar for Best Actress! I recommend this movie.

2 July 2007,"Great film, always entertaining and very powerful at times.","Million Dollar Baby is a rare kind of film in that it manages to express so much more than what's happening on the screen and in the soundtrack. Even though the film generally has a very calm pace, it is never boring and although a number of scenes are very quiet and with little movement, they're always engaging and often quite powerful.

Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood all deliver great performances and manage to give their characters a depth that few movies can match. The script flows well and gives the characters room to breathe and take on a life of their own. It also has plenty of humour which is always welcome in a drama. The music by Clint Eastwood (he composes music as well!) is simple but extremely effective. It has the weight of someone working comfortably within their range rather than someone limited by some kind of inexperience. It enhances the impact of the movie and never distracts.

The boxing scenes are very well directed although as many have pointed out, Million Dollar Baby is not so much a boxing film as a film about a boxer. The third act is especially well made and is very powerful and beautiful. Those that suggest Million Dollar Baby is making some kind of stance on certain controversial topics are missing the point completely. It is about the characters, the decisions they have to make and why they choose to do what they do. Arguably it is all about love.

This is probably the best movie of the year (even though The Incredibles was also excellent) and everyone should definitely see it!",10
6 February 2005,"Greatest Film Sine ""Shawshank""","I myself am currently a film school student so to measure the quality of a film is much more complicated considering the things we learn to take into account. (Which characters have arcs, who's the mentor, who's the weight-and-mass character, where and when is the second act turning point, etc.) In the 22 years I have been in existence there was until recently only one utterly flawless film in existences and that was ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

But now this gem of a film must serve alongside the blatant brilliance of ""Million Dollar Baby"". Unlike most film enthusiasts I did not have the highest expectations of this film seeing as how I was not that big a fan of ""Mystic River"" so when my buddy convinced me to go I was skeptical. Fifteen minutes in I knew if the film just kept it bearings the result would be metaphorically orgasmic. Everyone from Morgan Freeman to Hilary Swank and Jay Baruchel played the emotionally draining script to a pristine glimmer.

This film is undoubtedly the best film of the year and one of the best I've seen in my entire life. (And I've seen than most.) The acting, directing, script, and plot are all top notch.

Igive this film 15 out of 10!!!!",10
11 February 2005,Give me a break! this movie is for Sado-Masochism purposes only!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
11 September 2006,Good but not excellent,"The film leaves many mixed feelings and emotions. First, the actors' play is always very good. Marty Freeman, Clint Eastwood and of course Hillary Swank are in all senses excellent actors, their delivery is impeccably smooth and almost close to perfection. It is not the acting that spoils the mood, it is the very tedious tempo of the film. Did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring? The acute, high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring ""real life"" moments, when we see that they are also people, that they have their problems too and so on. But, dear me, I always wait till these boring moments will be replaced with those sharp sporty scenes again. The same with MDB - as a sport film, this is great, as anything else, it is slightly slowish and boring.

23 May 2010,Cliché-packed amateur production,"I never cease to be amazed at how easily manipulated the American public can be: witness the rave reviews and awards lavished on Eastwood-directed movies: that pretentious excuse for a Western, ""Unforgiven,"" got the Oscar for Best Picture for Goodness' sake! As for MDB, its plot is full of clichés and inconsistencies that leave thinking viewers frustrated. (Judging from some of the reviews on this site it seems that I'm not the only one to have been mostly underwhelmed by this Eastwood amateurish confection.) After the first 15 minutes of listening to Morgan Freeman's sappy voice-over comments I felt like beating up Walter Brennan. The best I can say about this movie is that Clint Eastwood gives his best performance since ""Revenge of the Creature.""

23 March 2012,Eastwood is incredible!,"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.",8
3 February 2007,"Drags a bit, but decent character study","Another sports movie. In fact, a boxing movie. A boxing movie with Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. It's more of a drama, I feel, but it's still a sports movie, but a more individualistic one. Like boxing movies before it, it still has the training scenes, the fight scenes, etc. There is a quiet buildup as the characters reveal more and more about themselves. The movie isn't too sledgehammer, but at times it does put more in your face than it needs to. Like Morgan Freeman's running commentary track. Voice-over narration really isn't necessary for this movie and I think that it took away, rather than added to the film.

There is a whole subplot involving a priest and Clint Eastwood's character's faith (or lack thereof). If it had been ejected from the film, it would've only served to make the film tighter. It doesn't really complexify Frankie, nor does it substantially add to the film. Clint is a mostly talented actor and director (don't watch Blood Work, it's not very good). The cast does a good enough job.

The ending of the film (or, the falling action), dragged on a little too long and Eastwood is known for slightly languid pacing. He doesn't manage to pace any better here, but still, in the end, the film was probably the best of the airplane fare that I saw and I enjoyed it enough that I kept watching even though I was feeling quite sick. It could've been even better if the editing and direction were a little less kitchen-sink and plain, but not a bad movie. Not a happy one either, so don't watch it if you want to feel good. 7/10.",7

27 March 2005,My heart went to Million dollar Baby for 2005.,"I never expected it to be that ""very good"".

The film hasn't been shown in Manila when the Oscars were televised, and I was rooting for The Aviator (saw 4 out of the 5 films nominated for best picture). I am a big fan of Martie Scorcese, and I really do want him to win the best picture or best director Oscars. And I really just thought that Million dollar Baby was another dramatic boxing film like Rocky, etc. But when I saw the film, I was blown away.

Blown away? Yes, by its originality and realistic film making.

The film was not over-acted, and Swank was good. For Clint, I really don't know about his acting but the leading actor of Sideways is better than him and should be nominated for an Oscar (what's his name?). I think Clint lack the real emotion for a hurting father. He just squinted for an Oscar nomination. And Morgan's acting was not the usual (strong person-eloquent-type), and he deserves the Oscar.

But I salute Clint for his tasteful direction. Bravo! Simple and effective.

I hope Marty Scorcese will win someday, I am a bigger fan of his films, but not this year. My heart went to Million dollar Baby for 2005.",10

3 September 2010,"Would a Bright, Primary Color Here or There Be Too Much to Ask, Mr. Eastwood?","""Million Dollar Baby"" hit me like a punch to the solar plexus while I was watching it in the theater. But then afterwards, when I started to think critically about the movie, little nagging details started to really bug me and took away from the film's lingering impact.

Clint Eastwood does fine work as an actor, but my praise of his directing abilities has cooled somewhat over time. There's something overly formal about his films that always remind me I'm watching a movie. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is relentlessly gray and brown, both in actual physical production design and in tone. Though it seems like matter-of-fact filmmaking stripped of any pretense, Eastwood infuses his controversial story with very little ambiguity. He stacks the deck so much in favor of the film's final thesis -- that assisted suicide with dignity is better than living out the rest of one's life in a paralyzed state -- that there's little room for argument. And the goonish caricatures he presents as Hilary Swank's trailer trash family are an embarrassment to his movie.

This film clearly comes from a heartfelt place, but it's not without its flaws.

Grade: B+",7
18 January 2005,Powerful Boxing Movie,"Great story, great acting, great characters; Million Dollar Baby has it all. One of the most solidly entertaining sports movies of any sport, this one is a true winner.

Clint Eastwood shows why he is one of Hollywood's all-time great actors and directors. Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies that can be discussed for hours.

Maggie, played by a wonderful Hilary Swank, is determined to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Clint). Frankie doesn't train girls, and he sluffs her off. It isn't until Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who manages the boxing gym for Frankie gives Maggie some help and encouragement, that Frankie decides to take her on.

Frankie is taken by Maggie's enthusiasm, will, and determination. When he meets her family and realizes that the only person in the world that she can trust is him, he pledges to see her through and develops a strong admiration and love for her.

The movie tightens even more when tragedy strikes, and the closeness of the three characters is even more pronounced. All the characters stay true to form; Maggies family as opportunistic, greedy, trailer trash; Frankie as Maggie's best friend, and Frankie as the steadying influence throughout the movie.

Exceptionally strong acting by all the stars, which is to be expected. It is no coincidence that the narration of the movie by Morgan Freeman could remind one of another classic that he narrated, ""The Shswshank Redemption"". The supporting characters, especially Jay Baruchel playing a very entertaining ""Danger"", did a wonderful job as well.

Million Dollar Baby is as inspirational as ""Rocky"", but with better acting and a more powerful ending. You don't have to be a boxing fan to by overwhelmed by Million Dollar Baby.",10

28 January 2006,I can't figure out why people thought this was so good,"I think Clint is a fine actor and director and certainly Hilary Swank is a good actress. Of course I love everything Morgan Freeman has ever been in, he's the always great. But I can't understand why people thought this movie was so great. Sure we feel sorry for Frankie and Maggie but the story is a story we've all seen before. Poor girl finds grumpy old man and they both learn to love each other. So what. I also thought that the ending was totally made up. I work in the medical profession and I can tell you it would never happen like it was portrayed. A competent adult, especially one who can speak as clearly as she could with a tracheostomy tube in, would be allowed to make her own medical decisions. So though the performances were good the movie itself was just like the rest okay.

18 January 2005,I Don't Get The Hype,"Very good film, but hardly ""the masterpiece"" described by Roger Ebert. It is basically a very well done Hallmark Hall of Fame TV Movie. It has Clint Eastwood as a lovable curmudgeon with a heart of gold. Hillary Swank, who is terrific, plays a strong-willed survivor with a heart of gold. Morgan Freeman is cast in his usual role of a wise, quiet observer with a heart of gold. All this becomes ultimately too cloying. Perhaps I expected more because so much was written about it. A good movie, but still doesn't surpass ""Sideways"" as best picture of the year. Hillary Swank should get the Oscar for her acting, however. See it, but not with your expectations too high.

28 June 2023,An absolute masterpiece,"Million Dollar Baby (2004) is an Eastwood masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on MAX. The storyline follows a desperate young lady and a boxing trainer who lost his contender and doesn't want to train females. The young lady convinces him that she's worth his time, thanks to some coaxing by a janitor that works at the gym. A bond is formed between the three individuals that will change their lives forever.

This movie is directed by, and stars, icon Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven) and also stars Hillary Swank (P. S. I Love You), Morgan Freeman (Se7en), Jay Baruchel (Goon), Mike Colter (Luke Cage), Anthony Mackie (Avengers), Michael Peña (American Hustle) and Riki Lindhome (The Last House on the Left).

This movie is an absolute gem in every way. The movie has a tremendous cast, narration and perfectly written dialogue. The storyline is unique with great subplots and unpredictable circumstances. You really get bought into the characters which makes them easy to root for and every scene more dramatic. The background music is perfectly selected and the ending is magnificent, no matter how sad it is.

Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece and must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10
29 January 2005,"A Tour De Force for Freeman, Swank, and Eastwood","While much has been said for the performances of all three actors, Morgan Freeman steals the show in many ways. His performance here is as powerful as his work in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood subtly pull you in close to their characters. Watching their performances was like watching a well choreographed dance. As celluloid art, this film shines brightly, but the movie also serves as a great platform for discussion of very personal and profound life issues. This movie may not appeal to those who go to movies simply to be entertained or to see ""a heartwarming story,"" although in many untraditional ways, the story is heartwarming and moving. When I left the theater, my mind and heart was satisfied and my thoughts were challenged. Definitely worth watching!

20 February 2005,An instant classic,"Million Dollar baby is in my opinion the best picture of the year. I've seen all except Finding Neverland and I would have to say that this one is the best. (Sideways a close second). Clint Eastwood shows us again why he is one of the greatest actors and directors of all time. Hilary Swank clearly deserves to be the best actress, and hopefully Freeman will get his Oscar. I'm my opinion, Eastwood deserved best picture last year for Mystic River. This year, he will get the Oscar.I don't know if you will leave the theater angry, upset, sad, or moved, but you will leave the theater feeling a little bit different after you have seen million dollar baby. Could possibly be the best boxing movie since Rocky. 10/10

7 July 2007,"Rather overrated, but still a good film","Every once and a while, and sometimes even more often than that, there comes a film that critics practically drool over. Erupting headlines shoot like geysers from The New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. I get excited when there's a film like this, because I'm excited to see it and get my own opinions on it. Unfortunately, many times, I don't exactly like the film. For 2004, that film is Million Dollar Baby.

Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a southern 31-year-old from Missouri who has come from a broken home, and has one dream: to win the title of a boxing championship. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the acclaimed boxing manager. ""I don't train girls,"" is Dunn's immediate reflex once Maggie asks him to train her. Eventually, Dunn takes her as a trainee and eventually manages her boxing career, and the two of them begin an extremely strong, non-romantic emotional bond as Maggie advances towards her dream.

Of course, there's more complex elements to the story than that, but really, that's it in a nutshell. For some reason, I believe that the all-star cast (Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman) helped bring this mediocre film to it's blockbuster status, and also helped it go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Yes, you'll hear critics say it's ""Remarkable"" and ""The best film of the year"" but none of them will ever say ""Unique."" Quite simply, because, there is nothing original about this film at all. There are so many films about someone going after their dreams I've lost count, and frankly, most of them are better and less appreciated than Million Dollar Baby.

Of course, there are some huge highpoints this film has hit. One--Clint Eastwood really was the right choice for director. He did a superb job with the film, made it detailed without making it boring, and made it an easier film to watch without having to concentrate super-hard like you're taking the SATs in high school. Two--Paul Haggis's incredibly talented writing skills shine through like rays of sun through a thin white bed sheet in this film. It's not so much that the screenplay was original, funny, and creative like the Oscar-winning one of Little Miss Sunshine, but it was so extraordinarily well written and the dialogue is extremely realistic. Three--astounding performances by Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman (in my opinion, ALL of them worthy of Oscars) bring the film to its feet. Mixed with Paul Haggis's exquisitely written screenplay, it's almost like you're watching a documentary. And in no way is that a bad thing! Now we'll go back to the negative points for a bit. My least favourite thing about Million Dollar Baby is the ending. I can't really say much without ruining the film for you, but it was evident they were going for a very emotional and hard-hitting ending. Unfortunately, I didn't feel it. I get very emotional at sad films and am considered a rather emotional person, but the ending felt very rushed, overworked, and sloppily done. If they had spent another few weeks working on the ending, the ending alone would have made this film a classic.

Overall--don't get me wrong. This is a GOOD film. It's just very overrated, and in my opinion, isn't deserving of all people say it's cut out to be. And definitely not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.",6
14 January 2005,Eastwood is Hollywood's Savior... 4 stars!!!,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9
24 March 2005,Lingers in your mind for days and days,"Clint Eastwood seems to be one of only a few film makers around with any confidence. The confidence comes from the story he is telling, which he fully believes in and the way he tells it. So many directors today seem to use flashy editing and visuals in order to keep the attention of an audience with a rapidly decreasing attention span and also to cover up the flaws in whatever story is being told.

Eastwood knows what a good story he is telling and therefore he allows the story to dictate the visual style and not vice - versa.

What we then get is a film which is beautiful in every conceivable way from the production design, to the cinematography, and the performances. Morgan Freeman is not only one of the greatest actors alive, but also one of the greatest narrators. His narration for the film is restrained yet very powerful. It adds another dimension to a film already on the right path.

From the beginning to the very end of the film I cared very much for the characters and the different spiritual journeys they take through the story. This is when I noticed what films are meant to be. 'Million Dollar Baby' reminds us how entertained and enthralled we can be from watching a good story with characters we care for and are interested in. Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood, and Hilary Swank give the most moving and authentic performances in many years. The flawless script by Paul Haggis and the always assured direction from Clint Eastwood elevate this film to a masterpiece. After seeing this film it lingered in my mind for days. This is what great films do and Million Dollar Baby is no exception.",10
25 September 2006,Why? Why? Why?,"I just don't gettit - WHY do people like this movie? Why even bother making such a huge gigantic pile of poop? There's enough crappy stuff in the world without making movies about the worst of it. This movie is really 'victimy' too much like; 'oh look! poor little me!' My recommendation is to throw this straight from the wrapping to the waste disposal unit. Because its a wasted effort, it might make you cry but it won't hand you a hankie. Think of all the money they poured into it and wasted - kinda like taking Grade A Maple Syrup and pouring it all over your kitchen floor. Wasteful, Stickey & certainly not smart. Go outside and hug a tree, you'll feel good. But don't watch THIS movie if you want to feel good, coz you won't, can't. Depressing Nonsense. And Hilary Swank is way too butch and unattractive in this, so there's no hott chick content. Nor hott guy, coz Clint Eastwood I think is way way way past having sex-appeal! LOL

12 April 2005,its rocky without the happy ending,"a great movie one of the best I've ever seen. it is a great boxing movie but it isn't just about the sport. it also follows the dilemmas of the characters. i really loved how while the story went on you also saw another boxing hopeful by the name of danger i thought one of the best parts was when Danger was getting beat up so Morgan Freeman's character stands up for him. i also loved how at the end you find out that the whole story was narration of a letter written to Clint Eastwood's character's daughter. all in all i thought this movie was wonderful it was definitely worthy of the 2004 best movie Oscar winner. you should definitely go see it its worth your money

1 May 2023,Virtue-Signaling Boxing Fairy Tale,"The only time that I can recall a boxing picture in which the trainer was not extremely reluctant to train anyone because he was embittered by the ""fight game"" was in a movie directed by a former boxer, making arguably the best boxing movie ever: John Huston's ""Fat City"" (1972). Ostensibly about pugilism, this is a film that considers euthanasia as its primary subject. The movie, especially its ending, is utterly implausible. One gets the impression that most people in Hollywood, who make films about boxing, have never attended a match or even seen a street fight. Conservative Republican Clint Eastwood shows that he supports equal opportunities for women, can be close buddies with a black man, and depict a white boy, called ""Danger"" as being absolutely ridiculous, but white boys are not the audience being pandered to with this turgid schmaltz.

28 June 2005,Does it deserve all the praise?,"Grand old man Clint Eastwood is highly respected. Its nice to see that he finds time to do unusual films (by Hollywood standards) as he is most definitely talented. But seriously, just because its slow paced, it doesn't mean that it is a masterpiece. The story is full of clichés and underwritten characters. It also has a voice-over by Morgan Freeman, that was really the only thing needed to be given credibility, the same case as with 'Shawshank Redemption'. In my opinion its annoying in the same measure.

Sure, Clint, Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank are great actors, and they all do good roles of what they're given. I was quite impressed by the physical development of Swank in fact. And Clint is a capable director.

The storyline absolutely had the ability to move me, but for the most of the time it dragged.

Look outside of Hollywood to find real great post 2k cinema.",4
5 February 2005,'Million Dollar Baby'... Priceless,"Take a film, strip it of special effects, a drop-dead-gorgeous female lead, and a box office-friendly, money-making plot line. Replace with a soul-shaking story, timeless performances, and a bone-shattering punch that comes not in the form of explosions, sex, or gratuitous violence, but in the genius of its direction, writing, and soulful thematic delivery; you get Million Dollar Baby. The film with 'million dollar' integrity and bargain $30 million price tag lands a killer, cinematic punch square in the dignity of films with the $150 million price tag and Dollar Store insignificance.

Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), determined, full of heart and empty of pocket enters the boxing gym of the hard-shelled and well-respected trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Between her low-paying and hopelessly mundane waitressing job at a local diner, Maggie lands punches at Frankie's gym. Taking little notice to and simply no concern for the ""girl"" who has been so doggedly training in his gym; Frankie is approached by his old friend Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who has seen something in Maggie, not in the force of her blows, but the strength of her heart. Several times Maggie pleads with Frankie to train her and several times he turns her down. That is until, one night, when another shoebox full of un-opened letters returned from his daughter is filled and Frankie must decide to regain the daughter he lost. Finally accepting her offers, Frankie begins to train the scrappy and determined 31 year-old amateur. Having not in her unfortunate life seen a fraction of the love and care given to her by her new trainer, Maggie is bestowed a father figure in the most unlikely of places. Having not had anything to love and care for the longest of times, Frankie is given the daughter he lost so long ago. Fighting and sweating and bleeding, Maggie works her way to the Las Vegas title fight Frankie never participated in. All the way she is loved and grows closer with her trainer and all the way Frankie regains the fire to care for the person behind the gloves, and not just the gloves themselves.

Known for his classical and quiet approach to direction, allowing the actors and storyline to carry his films into the annuls of film hierarchy, Clint Eastwood reaches far beyond the industry's wildest expectations and lands a cinematic punch of unparalleled magnitude in this riveting modern classic. Pacing is done to perfection with well-built character development across the ensemble and general calculated patience in the maturity of the story. The viewer is allowed to ease into their seats early in the film so that they may be as comfortable as is possible before the film's enthralling climax. Simple camera movements and framing (a moniker of Eastwood) are utilized without the pretentious and dizzying camera spasms of Stone, Rodriguez and other ostentatious directors. The unadulterated ability, grit, and strength of character Eastwood exudes through the film give it its poignant, numbing effects. Simple, yet ruggedly-elegant cinematography bodes well for the overall might of the picture. Praised by his casts for allowing their ability as actors to speak through their performances and not through their costumes, make-up, or ""punch-lines"" and for his meticulous attention to emotions and not explosions, Eastwood's pioneering directorial integrity are ingrained in every frame of Million Dollar Baby.

Morgan Freeman delivers another Oscar-caliber performance as the warm-hearted, one-eyed ex-boxer, Eddie. Emotional presence is exuded into every line in a performance mimicking the timelessness of the role of Red in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Eastwood's unmistakable grit and emotional veracity in his Oscar-nominated performance is simply unforgettable and brings the driest of eyes to tears. But, out-doing even the thematic valor of Freeman and Eastwood is the simply breathtaking, inspiring, and mind-numbing performance of one, Hilary Swank. In the title role of Maggie Fitzgerald, Swank is immaculate. In a portrayal that can only be characterized as miraculous, Swank brings the audience's eyes to the screen as they watch her struggle to survive, taking half-eaten food from the plates of the customers she waits-on. She brings us to the edge of its seats when she enters the ring. She brings us to cheers and revelry with each bloody, pulse-pounding, jaw-shattering first-round knockout. She brings us all to our knees in her despair after being denied the slightest scrap of gratitude after buying her odious, gold-digging, ingrate of a mother a home with what little money she has earned in her early bouts. She moves our souls, touches our hearts, and reaches to wipe-off our tears in scenes of such moving poignancy, they are simply impossible to describe in words. A flawless, awe-inspiring performance at the apex of thematic capacity.

Without giving away Million Dollar Baby's gut-wrenching climax, I must touch-on its jarring inspiration.

How valuable is something that is two-of-a-kind? How priceless is something that has happened only once before in over 550 different experiences? It is timeless. It is priceless. Until Million Dollar Baby, I had wept only once before during a film. That prestigious honor went to one of the greatest achievements in the history of the arts, Schindler's List (1993). Accompanying me to the film were two of my closest friends, one of which would cry in Finding Nemo, the other has teared-up in only a small handful of films. One, as to be expected ran out of tissues and had tears cascading down her face long after the film's credits rolled across the screen. The other, doing his very best to fight off the torrent of water building deep in his eyes, could not help but choke on his emotions. I, myself truly wept. With each tear the film was elevated to a higher level. With each falling drop, Million Dollar Baby instilled more in me, the movie-goer and me, the human being. Astounding direction, astonishing integrity, miraculous performances why we go to the movies. An inspiration.

18 June 2007,Kind of Depressing Knock-Out Movie.,"This is an Oscar-winning film about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress from a dysfunctional family, deciding to become a boxer. She seeks training from the experienced Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). What we see is a lower-class woman beating all odds to be a boxing champion, thus earning her a career that would put her in a better place in society. Swank gave a committed and solid performance, knocking out her opponents one after the other. What I like about Morgan Freeman is that he is steady, calm, yet powerful and dramatic is his acting. Clint Eastwood portrayed Dunn as pretty tired-looking and socially retired. He doesn't have much spirit and zest, due to his character being shut out of his daughter's life - very powerful. Eastwood also did a good job directing. Unfortunately, the movie does get pretty sad towards the latter half of the movie and the events only add on to the depressing life of Eastwood's character. My favorite scene in the movie is when Freeman knocks out an opponent of one of his trainees, proving that he still got the zest after all the years.

Overall, a pretty powerful, but depressing film.

1 January 2005,Worth More Than A Million,"Excellent, excellent. One of the aspects of this film I appreciate the most is that Eastwood and Freeman portray old men as they are. Not stereotypical, not for laughs (even though there are some amusing moments), but as real flesh-and-blood men with opinions as well as regrets. Being an amateur boxer myself, I could totally relate to the love of the sport that Swank's character had. The interactions between the three main characters are letter perfect. Never has Eastwood played such an emotional character, and Freeman is great as his closest friend and Greek chorus for the story. Swank has the right amount of toughness and vulnerability. There are a lot of moments where the characters are filmed in shadows, to emphasize the isolation they often feel. It also emphasizes their isolation from the world at large; the three are part of a sport that is seldom given any time in the press. Swank's character is further on the outs because she is a female trying to gain respect in a male-dominated sport. Eastwood and Swank's father/daughter relationship is the glue that pushes this film along.

6 February 2005,Million Dollar Must See!!,"This is a must see Clint Eastwood film. His finest acting in years. He teams up with Morgan Freeman in a way that is very reminiscent of Unforgiven. They are truly a dynamite pairing. My only complaint about the film is Clint brought back to life the gravely voice from Heartbreak Ridge that at times can be a little unclear. Morgan Freeman has a center roll in the movie as a narrator (much like Shawshank Redemption) and as Clints friend and fellow boxer/trainer. The two together with a fine performance from Hilary Swank make this film a must see. Take your Kleenex and be prepared. The music is clearly Clint and at times may remind you of pieces from Unforgiven.

The film is simply awesome, moving and unpredictable. This is one time that parting with 9.00 to see a movie wont be difficult. 10 out of 10 easily. If Clint can top this, I can hardly wait.

8 February 2005,excellent,"I took my granddaughter to see the movie. We were both extremely moved by the story. Clint does such a great job, you feel the emotions of the entire cast. I think I have seen every one of his movies, but couldn't pick a best one if I tried. He seems to find the best material and make it better. He is one of a kind! I saw him on The Actors studio and was impressed by his comments and responses to the students. The simplicity he uses make the movies stand out. The silence is wonderful, I think he reflects all of these things in his own personality. He certainly has my admiration, and thanks for making movies that make me think. The foibles of life are there in front of you.

4 May 2023,"""This Is My Fighter""","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a former cut man who now owns a gym. It's one of those no-nonsense gyms where fighters live their lives among the peeling paint, the stained canvas, and the discolored walls.

Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) is the manager of the gym. He and Frankie have a long history built on hard luck and a mutual understanding of unspoken debts.

Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) picks Frankie to be her trainer, showing up one day with an eagerness borne of ignorance. He won't train her for various reasons, including her age, but she has heart, and even a hardened case like Frankie has respect for such desire, so eventually he gives in.

There is no chewing of the scenery here. These actors deliver unstated elegance, like the music that accompanies the film. Their characters have nobility and a charm chiseled from the granite of their lives. They are all emotional orphans.

Eastwood directs, acts, produces, composes; he probably swept the sets. He creates a piece of art that give the viewer characters that one can root for. Freeman is counterpoint to Eastwood. Voiceovers generally should be avoided, but here he provides a beautiful narration that illuminates. Swank's character has a yearning in her eyes. She lives her life in occasional teaspoons of accomplishment, always remembering her emotionally impoverished roots.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is intelligently filmed and edited. The story is a heartbreaker. The acting is superb. The Oscars won were totally deserved. This is a film guaranteed to touch the viewer.",10

13 July 2022,Eastwood plus Freeman equals CLASSIC,"Million Dollar Baby is a must see movie that has and will continue to age well because it's a great story and it's not because it's a woman boxing. Great story about redemption, acceptance and friendship. The supporting cast was amazing but it's Eastwood and Freeman that deliver the chemistry. Anything with those two will automatically plus up a review several stars. If Freeman narrated a documentary about paint drying no doubt it'd be a minimum 8 star review. It's in the Bible that once Eastwood and Freeman leave this world then the world will end.

4 June 2010,Clint Eastwood + Hilary Swank + Morgan Freeman = A Knockout Masterpiece!,"Bolstered by knockout performances, balanced in all aspects of storytelling & finishing on a high note with a gut-wrenching finale, Million Dollar Baby is a wonderfully crafted, brilliantly narrated & expertly paced sports drama that may seem like just another underdog story at first but changes its course in the middle to end up as something else entirely.

The story of Million Dollar Baby follows an old, rugged & experienced but under-appreciated boxing trainer who has spent a lifetime in the ring training some incredible fighters but also finds himself being haunted by his past mistakes, for which he tries to make up by taking an amateur boxer under his wing & help her achieve her dream of becoming a professional.

Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film presents the actor-director in prime form & is the finest work of his directional career, in my opinion. The screenplay also deserves a mention for its character-driven narrative & the exhaustive level of depth provided to its characters makes it all the more commendable. And further refining its quality is the accomplished work in the technical department.

Production design team chips in nicely with well-detailed sets. Cinematography is easily my favourite aspect for the way its camera employs the controlled zooms, close-ups, slow-mo & sharp focus makes the drama all the more immersive, which is then further enhanced by precision lighting. Editing patiently paces the story & the background score, composed by Eastwood himself is perfectly in tune with the story.

Coming to the performances, Million Dollar Baby packs in a highly impressive cast in Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman with all three delivering strong performances in their given roles. Eastwood is as good in front of the camera as he's behind it. Swank steals the show with her career-best performance while Freeman is pretty grounded in his role yet his input & narration play a vital role in the experience this film provides.

On an overall scale, Million Dollar Baby is one of the finest examples of sports drama that may give an impression of travelling the Rocky route for a while but a surprising twist in the middle completely ends up changing the whole equation & from there on, it's an entirely different experience. A profoundly affecting, deeply heartbreaking & thoroughly engaging cinema, Million Dollar Baby is — in pure & simple words — a knockout masterpiece. Highly recommended.",
10 February 2005,recommendation,"Hello movie-lovers out there! Do yourselves a favor and go and see this great masterpiece from the biggest movie star alive today.

I was not quite sure of what to expect when I sat down to watch this film. I mean - what was this all about? Rocky with tits? Nothing could be further from the truth.

This film leaves you emotionally drained and sits with you in a long time after you leave the theater.

I have been a Clint Eastwood fan since the early seventies and I certainly hope that Clint will win Oscar for best Actor, as well as best Director, this time.

4 October 2018,Very Heavyweight.,"Sometimes it's hard, years after a particular Oscar season to look back and assess why a particular film did so well. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, for me, one such film. Though there are some aspects to admire, much of it feels like a fairly overt attempt to tick off ""Oscar worthy"" boxes.

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) runs a boxing gym with Eddie Dupree (Morgan Freeman). Reluctantly, Frankie agrees to train and then manage Maggie (Hilary Swank) a tenacious and prodigious boxer. Eventually the pair work their way up to a Las Vegas Title Fight which has fateful consequences for the pair.

Questionable politics aside, Clint Eastwood deserves his legendary status in Hollywood and though ""Million Dollar Baby"" doesn't come close to matching ""Unforgiven"", his talent at framing a shot, and use of lighting is evident. His performance in front of the character her is a little.. one note, and brooding, misanthrope does start to wear then - even when the actions of the conclusion start to weigh heavily on him. His verbal sparring with Morgan Freeman is nice though sometimes crosses the line from funny to bizarre. I wasn't massively impressed with Hilary Swank's performance either, though her commitment to the role was admirable, the rest of the execution felt a bit forced. (I know she won the Oscar, and who am I to criticise, but still, in my opinion).

The Casting Agent did a really good job though, with early performances from Mike Colter, Margo Martindale and the MCU double bill of Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena. The trouble is, apart from Colter's Willie who serves the plot by making Frankie wary of committing to training again, the rest of the gym are just there to fill time, with a unresolved B- Story that doesn't serve the film's narrative in any way.

Did I enjoy ""Million Dollar Baby""? No, how could I? How could anyone given the miserable conclusion? But did I appreciate it - somewhat. I had heard a little of the ending before seeing the film, so it wasn't as much of a bait and switch as it would have been at the time. It has, to be fair, stayed with me for the 24 hours after seeing it, but I'd also don't feel like I'll ever want to sit down and watch it again.",6
16 March 2005,The best movie I've ever seen...,"And that is saying a lot...because I consider myself to be a lover of movies...This ranks right alongside if not above Braveheart, The Godfather, and E.T. I can't say it is the movie I liked the most...but it is SO well acted...so well directed...and the story, although seemingly contrived worked for me. Swank has proved that she is in a class all by herself, with her second Oscar and quite possibly the best female performance I can EVER remember...it is the subtleties of her portrayal that makes this performance work... I was wondering if my assessment of this flick was way off, so I started surfing reviews...and for once, Roger Ebert has fully encapsulated my feelings...check it out...

30 September 2018,Clint Eastwood's Masterpiece,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) is a masterpiece - pure and simple. It knocks you to the bone. I have seen this movie like 3 times in my life, and it never looses it powerful punch. That is because of simple and simply perfect directing work by Mr. Eastwood, powerhouse performances by Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman both won Oscars for crying out loud!) as well as one of the best (if not) by in his carrier by Eastwood himself. And the heart of the movie lies not in a boxing sequences (although they are brutal and real) but in a relationships between these characters we do care about. And when the ending comes, prepare to have some pure small tears in your eyes - because this movie earns it.

Overall, as a director C.Eastwood made a lot of great and amazing movies, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" in my opinion is his crowning achievement. Movies are hardly being made better then this one.",10
3 January 2022,An Eastwood Story,"Eastwood once again presents a character and a story that you can really sink your teeth into.

The film at times can feel a little bleak but that fits well with both the story and the sport. Let me be clear this is not Rocky, it has no captivating soundtrack or uplifting training scenes etc its bleak and full of grit.

The performances are as good as you would expect.

Can be challenging to watch but well worth it.

27 March 2012,Aamzing story........,"Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.

I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was.",8
6 February 2005,Clint Eastwood weighs in on assisted suicide,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
22 October 2020,Heartbreaking,"Oh wow, this film really has an effect. It starts out with a typical rags-to-riches underdog story and peppers this with memorable characters like Clint Eastwood's trainer and the other patrons of the gym. The protagonist Maggie has a level of determination and energy that she uses to power through the fighting tournaments but then something tragic happens that really throws everyone off kilter. Some aspects of this reminded me of Eastwood's other film Gran Torino, in which he also plays a gruff mentor figure. However, Million Dollar Baby is a bit more depressing and he is nobody's saviour.

3 November 2013,Return To Sender,"What a dull disappointment. Clint chose to make a movie about boxing and all the mawkish 'rising underdog'/too old to succeed-meets cranky mentor with a heart of gold clichés.

The idea seems to be, take the best parts of ""Fat City"", ""Rocky"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", etc., stick them in a saucepan and boil them down to this, and it's guaranteed to be tasty.

Do we need to hear Freeman as the god/narrator again? Really? But Clint figured the movie couldn't function without him, as he seems to think the audience needs to explicitly hear him receive forgiveness from the deity.

The genre has been done to death, so if one is going to make a boxing movie, the movie needs to be about something other than boxing: ""Raging Bull"" was really about sado-masochism; ""Diggstown"" was really about con artistry; ""Fat City"" was really about the agriculture worker underclass.

And one area that Clint always gets right is his depiction of the blue-collar world and his effective promotion of young, unknown actors up the ranks. He would get this right in the superior ""Gran Torino"". There, he takes chances and succeeds; here, he takes absolutely no chances at all. It is contrived, and radiates this fact in an offensive way. No thanks.",5
26 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby is a great film,"I went to see this last night and was enthralled. There will be the comparisons to Rocky, but as a fight film this is closer to Raging Bull. Unlike the villainous tragedy of Deniro's Jake LaMatta, though, Eastwood and Swank both portray tragic heroes who are beautiful in their dignified, but inevitably doomed struggle. This film takes the viewer to a deep, uncomfortable place where no one would go unless compelled. Compelling is only one word to describe this movie, though. Masterful and artistic, while at the same time touchingly human, and ultimately, tragically real.

Like many great sports movies, Million Dollar Baby transcends its subject, and sport itself. This film is about respect, and pride, and dignity.

Rocky leaves the audience in the ring, and one has to remind himself that Balboa lost the fight. Million Dollar Baby consumes the viewer with loss, making us watch painfully as the story winds up. If there was bittersweet triumph in Rocky, there is subtle, quiet, and touching triumph here, that is unquestionably more real. Sadly, some stories just do not have happy endings. I have heard this film called ""depressing"", though, and I cannot agree. Sad, yes. Humbling and perhaps disturbing, but there was victory here and Swank gives an inspiring performance.

I have not seen the other films nominated for Best picture, or for some of the other awards, but this should win something.",10
28 July 2006,Thousand Dollar Baby,"Eastwood and Freeman are good as the grumpy and wise, respectively, old men running a boxing gym but the film belongs to Swank, who is terrific as a determined female boxer. The boxing scenes are well staged. However, some of the characters are cartoonish and the plot is implausible. Maggie's family is portrayed as poor white trash without a single redeeming quality. It is hard to believe that Maggie, who is an angel, could have come from such a family. The plot device of Eastwood unable to connect with his daughter while building a relationship with Swank is too obvious. It explores some serious themes but treats them superficially. All in all, it is well-acted by the three stars but it certainly is not worthy of Best Picture or Best Director Oscar.

My ending will be different, but I will be that powerful. The acting was superb. The directing was amazing. The twists were awesome. I totally recommend this movie for the whole world to see. There are no words to describe the greatness of this film. Hilary Swank was perfect for the part and her body build couldn't have been better. This is the kind of movie that inspires one to be greater. You walk out of the theater saying to yourself, ""That could be me one day."" It is inspirational and moving. Clint Eastwood did a spectacular job in his acting and his directing as well. My advise to you...GO SEE IT!

13 January 2023,Giving up the fight,"I don't know what it was about the early 2000s that turned Clint Eastwood's directing output around from largely middling fare to seriously fantastic filmmaking, but it honestly could be no more than him suddenly deciding to direct better scripts. He should keep doing that. What he found with Million Dollar Baby, a script by Paul Haggis, was a tragedy that gave him time to shine both in front of and behind the camera. I don't often get a bit choked at movies, but this is the first Eastwood movie to do that to me.

Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a gym owner and trainer whose latest protégé, Mickey (Bruce MacVittie), is becoming impatient with Dunn's very slow approach to getting him a title fight. As Dunn's business partner and friend, Eddie (Morgan Freeman), says, Dunn could have gotten Mickey the shot two years before, but Dunn won't commit. And that is the early crux of the story. Dunn is a fighter who doesn't want to commit. He's always on his heels, unwilling to charge into the fight, and he does that on every facet of his life. Into that life comes Maggie (Hilary Swank), a poor, approaching middle-aged woman with dreams of becoming a successful boxer. She wants Dunn to train her to be a fighter, but Dunn is simply not interested. However, when Mickey leaves Dunn for another manager who will give him his shot at the title, Dunn suddenly finds himself a bit lost.

This is a character piece at heart, and Frankie Dunn is a great central character. With a shadowed past of sin, in particular around his estranged daughter, he goes to mass daily where he seemingly just shows up to needle the priest (Brian O'Byrne) with borderline sacrilegious questions, a front to mask the guilt he carries around with him everywhere. Something in his past has kept him from reaching higher or faster, and then Maggie comes and is his exact opposite. She's untrained and overeager, winning small bouts messily in ways that show she's not ready to move up in class. She's also completely determined on getting Dunn as her manager, and she will not back down. Every time she moves in, he backs away, until he feels like he can't back away anymore, especially with Eddie encouraging them both at the same time.

Maggie is an eager student and eats up Dunn's advice, quickly becoming queen of her small class and obviously ready for a move up. She is alone in Los Angeles, her family living off of welfare back in Missouri, and in Frankie she sees a potential father figure, the kind of caring, attentive person she'd always lacked. Considering Frankie's cantankerousness, there's a certain irony in it, but like Frankie's treatment of the priest, it's a front.

And this is where the movie would feel the most generic save for Eastwood's directing style. If he were more of a chameleon, he'd ramp up the sports feeling of this middle section where Maggie begins to fight under his tutelage. However, Eastwood (for good or ill across his filmography) is just going to make movies his own, lowkey way no matter what, and it really ends up being an asset to Million Dollar Baby. Maggie has her rise to the top, but it's not handled in an over-the-top fashion, it's handled with tact and a certain quietness so that scenes of Maggie easily winning matches can rest surprisingly comfortably with small scenes of two people talking in subdued tones, like when Eddie explains to Maggie about how Frank tried to get him out of a fight decades past that Eddie refused to back out of where he eventually lost and lost his eye. Frankie never brings it up, but Eddie can see it in Frankie's face every time he looks at him.

Frankie cannot let go of the past. It's why he goes to mass every day. It's why he acts so slowly in advancing in life. He's been hurt somehow, and he's carried that hurt for a very long time, and it's Maggie who finally finds a way to let him reach out to someone else again.

And then, of course, the movie takes a hard turn in Maggie's title shot fight, and we suddenly see that no, we were not in a sports movie, but we've definitely been in a tragedy the whole time. This is why Eastwood's lowkey approach to the middle section is such an asset. We do get the standard elements of the sports underdog story, but keeping it muted in tone doesn't lead to a whiplash at the turn. We know we're in a drama primarily through the first 90 minutes, so when there's the turn, it's an evolution of that rather than a complete undermining of the more general sports take it could have had.

The finale is dominated by Frankie's newfound determination to fight for Maggie. He fights for her health, for her money, and for her life. She has become his replacement daughter and he her replacement father. They are all they have in the world, and Frankie is going to do everything he can. He's going to fight for the first time in decades up until the point where Maggie stops fighting and gives up.

This is the controversial part of the film, but much like the ending of Mystic River, it's an embrace of the morally complex. Frankie has an impossible decision to make, something that if he does it he will destroy his soul, as the priest says. This is a greater sin than anything he's committed in his life up to that point, and his scene with the priest is probably Eastwood's finest moment as an actor. He's completely torn apart by this, and his moment where he finally reveals himself (in part) to the priest is heartbreaking. He's going to do something wrong. He's going to hurt the woman who has become his daughter, but he feels like he has to do it because she wants him to.

Could Maggie have lived a full life in her state? As full as any other handicapped person, but she doesn't see it that way. She's outright suicidal to the point that doctors have to keep her permanently sedated. She won't accept the life she suddenly has, and no one will convince her otherwise. What Frankie does is a mercy, but it destroys him in the process. He essentially vanishes, like a ghost. I remember reading the short story collection that inspired the screenplay (Rope Burns by F. X. Toole), and the writing there makes it more explicit that Frankie destroys himself in doing what he does. Of course, anything outside the film doesn't count, but Eddie's voice over (which wonderfully reveals itself to be a letter to Frankie's daughter by the end) reinforces the same idea. After it's done, Frankie has nothing.

This is an awful choice that Frankie must make, and I was there with him. It was a gut wrenching decision that I might not have taken myself, but which I understood. He's finally found something to fight for, and he has to give it up. Not only is he losing his one real connection in the world, but he's also been defeated in reversing his entire outlook on life. She had opened him up to fighting again, to leading instead of falling back, and her pain knocked him back as well, but it was her giving up that knocked him flat. That's just good writing right there.

I think Eastwood himself is the centerpiece in the acting round here, but the rest of the cast is wonderful as well. That starts with Swank as the white-trash with a dream Maggie, who's full of fight, not all that smart, but is willing to listen and learn. Her earnestness in her attempts make her a great scrappy figure at the center of a typical sports film, and the tragic direction in the final third she handles well in her limited physical state. Freeman is a rock that operates almost like a Greek chorus, especially in his voiceover (the mere presence of which was becoming something of a cliché at this point in cinematic history, for sure) while also offering up some of the film's small lighthearted moments. He also has some nice screentime with Jay Baruchel who plays a hopeless, all-heart welterweight wannabe who could never get a real fight.

This is one of the triumphs of Eastwood's career. This is a hard-hitting film that perfectly matches with Eastwood's directing style. It's some of the finest acting in an Eastwood movie, all laid on top of a foundation written by Haggis that understands its structure and characters incredibly well.",10
9 February 2022,"Marvellous, just marvellous","Unreal! I didn't expect 'Million Dollar Baby' to be so astonishingly brilliant.

I've said it many a time before but for full context, I do not read up about films before watching them - aside from making sure the film isn't part of a franchise, checking the run time and seeing the genre - so I was expecting this to be a cliché-filled, but still great, sports flick. It's so much more than that.

It's way more deeper and has an everlasting impact that I hadn't anticipated. Even across the opening chunk I was predicating the obvious cliché ending, but as the film progresses and, especially, as the final portion rolls around it just absorbed my total attention - I was fully engrossed... hook, line, and sinker. Some film!

The cast are simply stunning. Clint Eastwood gives an absolutely fantastic performance, Hilary Swank is truly sensational - especially at the end, damn - and Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman; what an actor and what a voice, using him as narrator was a great move. Elsewhere, and though less dramatically, Jay Baruchel, Anthony Mackie, Margo Martindale and Michael Peña also feature interestingly.

It's quite the journey the film takes you on, which I just found utterly enthralling to watch unfold. Perfect pacing, perfect acting. I loved watching every second of it and will undoubtedly be revisiting it.

I noted days ago that I was rather surprised to learn that Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' had been so heavily acclaimed, on this occasion with this 2004 film I am the complete opposite. I don't care much for awards et al., but I am delighted to see all involved receive their props for this. Chapeau!

Marvellous, just marvellous.",10
26 March 2005,"A must see, in my humble opinion","""It is what it is"", watch it for yourself before you judge it based on what someone else says about it. Most all of Clint Eastwoods movies live up to the hype and this one is no different. Well written, well acted. Most everybody will have something to pick out as to what they are disappointed by. But not all of us are bent on dissecting everything we see and analyzing its meaning. I took my two sons, One who is 17, the other who is 14. Both did not really want to see it based on what they saw in a commercial.I really had to talk the oldest into going and forced the youngest. After the movie I could tell it really had an effect on them. They both will tell you it wasn't what they thought it was. They both will also tell you it was one of the best movies they had seen in awhile. Chalk it up to a history of Clints movies and me being a fan of them. Or ""Father knows Best"".

2 February 2020,million dollar baby,"Million dollar baby is defienetly one of saddest films ever at least for me,the thing that distances this film from other boxing ones is that is more a big epic drama about life and forgivness and then a boxing film,simple said if you want to watch enterteining film with fights and silly plots you watch rocky films,if you want something more then that this one is for you,everyone in this film did a masterful job starting with eastwood who proved that he can be a great director when he wants,to freeman who was great and hillary who stole every scene with her spirit and likeablite,million dollar baby is a film that is hard to watch but it also shows why films like this are memorable and regonisable by every film lover that apprieciete true art

19 January 2005,Simply amazing,"Before i saw this movie i wasn't to excited about it. Just because i've never been a real fan of Clint Eastwoord. But i'm a movie-fanatic so i watched it. Now i've completely changed my point of view about him.

In one word: masterpiece!

The acting phenomenal, visually well brought, the music is good, the story, and so on, were all extraordinary. It makes me want to see Boys don't cry, Unforgiven and Shawshank Redemption again (the best movies of each of the main actors).

One last thing (and I think not many will like what I'm about to say...), to hell with The Aviator, this one has to get as many Oscars as possible!

7 February 2005,"Good, but not great film","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",6
14 February 2005,Typical Clint Eastwood 5/10,"TYPICAL CLINT EASTWOOD 5/10. Not a Hollywood ending (you are warned); shock ending. Not very good. He just puts typical hyper-emotional damaged characters together to battle it out. He doesn't worry about some of the logic to end the movie properly. The movie goes from drive to 'reverse' without reason-ability. His characters are about street people making barely audible 'smart' comments about life. Clint acts like Clint with his typical restrained and inaudible voice. He just puts typical hyper-emotional damaged characters together to battle it out. He doesn't worry about some of the logic to end the movie properly. The movie goes from drive to 'reverse' without reason-ability.

14 November 2017,A soulpunch,"A heartbreaking experience, a film that literally punches you in the face, in all its sincere and genuine emotions. Eastwood's directing style is sober and clean, and the story is truly touching in its simplicity. The performances are outstanding, Swank in particular was born for the role, but all the actors did well.

15 February 2019,Minimalism yields emotions,"This is one of Eastwood's most distinctive looking films. Using very static camerawork as well as a very subdued color palette Eastwood's film is rendered as a dance of light and darkness. The characters always seems to be floating in and out of shadows. It is as if they are on the edge of the abyss. The critical car scene when Maggie discusses her father and dog is especially striking in this regard. It is almost in the light is drawing the story out of her while plunging Frankie into darkness, or maybe it is the other way around. In any case the film is pushed in the quasi-Noir that fits the story perfectly.

This feature greatly enhances the performances by providing a ironic counterpoint to them. Eastwood, Freeman and especially Swank raw naturalism is all the more painful because of the direction. It is also worth noting that Frankie is among the most complex characters Eastwood has played and his steely masculinity is put to good ends here. Swank found her signature character in Maggie and boy is her turn heartbreaking.

The script isn't quite as good as the actual film. Eastwood as director really does enhance the story. The script is a bit too simple in its characterizations. The Blue Bear and Maggie's mother especially suffer from one note portrayals. Nonetheless, it reworks the genre into a power exploration of bodily autonomy and has one of the best uses of voice over I have seen, especially in how it is justified. It is quite literally a solid first draft.

The 3rd act twist and the treatment of the underlying issues will greatly bother some people. I am bothered by the central metaphor that Maggie uses to express her final desire. I can't fault the script for realism on this point; it is how Maggie would think of it. The expression is truthful for *these* characters but social it is a deeply troubling idea. The film is strong enough to treat its ending as ambiguous.

This is quite a film. It is so simple on the first pass. But the more you look at it the more graceful it seems.",10
24 May 2017,I was amazed when I saw this movie.,"In this story a woman, Maggie wanted to learn boxing. So she finds a coach who never trained girls. But Maggie would not give up and the coach's friend helps her to convince the coach to train her. I think this was a wonderful movie. I think everyone should go for it. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.

10 October 2005,a fine new addition to an American tradition in film-making,"Since the days of silent film and pioneer filmmakers such as DW Griffith, and the days of the Western and its main contenders like John Ford, and through the time of the gangster films of Raoul Walsh and the like, and until today, there has been a tradition in American film, a tradition of film-making and storytelling that chronicles the great struggle for self-fulfillment and achievement. In ""Million Dollar Baby"", we have a grand return to this form by Clint Eastwood, one of the quintessentially American filmmakers still working today. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is by no means a virtuoso film, or innovative in its use of the camera or cutting. Here is a film that sticks to tried and true methods such as continuity cutting, smooth tracking shots, and atmospherically centered and balanced mise-en-scene. The film establishes a true sense of place in the boxing ring, the gym, and the hospital. The camera takes us through the world revealing to us the truth of things rather than telling us the truth of things. The characters play out their interactions thus without stylistic interference. Indeed, Eastwood has mastered the Hollywood style. He has stripped it of all its commercial coverings, and shown us what American film-making is really all about: honesty. A character study of enormous depth that plays out in a tried and true narrative, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a hard nut to crack. It is a film about finding peace with oneself, about the generosity and determination of the human spirit. It is a film about the battles each of us fights but that no one likes to talk about. A great movie, it is about hope and redemption in the end. I was profoundly moved.",9
13 March 2005,Great movie.,"This is a really great movie with some really great actors. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman are so amazing in it. It really deserved all the Oscars they got. The cast and the script is great. I hated the end not because it wasn't great done but because it was too sad. Clint Eastwood is a great director and Steven Spielberg knew what we was saying about Clint Eastwood. Hilary Swank acted so amazing and Morgan Freeman totally deserved the Oscar. I hope you get to see this movie because you will love it. It'a a great drama story and i hope you'll enjoy it like i did. It's an amazing movie and in my opinion the best of 2004.

15 April 2006,"Good flick, but a bit overrated","This was a pretty good movie. Clint Eastwood directs in a reasonable, straightforward way that does not detract from the story or the acting. Some directors just have to find a way to say ""LOOK AT ME!!!"" Oliver Stone comes to mind. Excellent athletic acting by Hilary Swank. And Eastwood's acting is by now as professional as it gets. Same for Morgan Freeman. I'm sure everyone is aware of the ending by now, but I will follow the rules and avoid writing a spoiler. I wish that I had not known what was coming. I can imagine how powerful all that must have been to people who thought that they were just watching a boxing movie. While I may not agree with the politics involved, it was done powerfully, and relatively tastefully. While I enjoyed the film, I don't believe that it is the 61st best movie of all time. I don't even think it was the best film of 2004. It is good, though, and I recommend viewing it.

10 February 2005,Good but not great,"I liked MDB but not as much as some did. It portrayed the gritty boxing gym scene OK in parts, but had some glaring boxing technical mistakes or oversights that bothered me. Why didn't Eastwood run the film for boxing technical advisors before the final cut? Oh, well. But it did convey the emotion and drama of ""fight night"" pretty well, however Eastwood's very spare acting and direction have gotten quite threadbare for me over the years, and often I wish for a bit more emotional ""ooomph"" in his films. I get kinda weary of the Joe Friday, ""just the facts, maam"", school of acting and direction so typical of Eastwood.

Swank was terrific in her role but too was way too angelic and saintly for real life as a vicious knockout fighter, Freeman didn't ring true for today when he did not take any offense at all when called the N-word over and over by a mentally defective, wannabe fighter, and Eastwood was not terribly convincing as he vastly underplayed his role as a crusty and irritable trainer and manager. But the film did make a creditable attempt to show that sometimes a life just may be worth dying for certain people in certain situations, especially after a tragedy takes 99% of it from them beforehand. Very controversial issue in America's ""just say no to assisted suicide"" position of today.

Not nearly as good a film as Sideways, but worthy.",
13 October 2006,"No boxing film per se, but an old-fashioned drama & tear-jerker","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",6
6 February 2005,Extremely moving,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. Tough, violent and extremely moving. Million dollar baby is his best third work before the camera, (I think his first was Unforgiven, and his second Bird- unbelievably underrated-). Eastwood knows about boxing movies, and He knows that black and white is the best to shoot a boxing movie, but he also knows that nowadays everybody remember excellent Ranging Bull, so He tries a new way to shoot it: Lights and shadows. He creates the atmosphere with lights and shadows in the gym and in hospital scenes. It's an old game that Eastwood plays along the movie. But he has another trick... A great storyline. And Eastwood, a very good director, turns a typical boxing movie into a powerful losers drama which would make Eastwood himself cry. The best American movie of this 2005 Oscar, very far away from dull and dusty The Aviator.

19 July 2005,"$500,000 Cliché **","(Spoilers Galore):

Here it is in a nutshell, so don't read if you haven't seen the movie or if you don't want the whole thing revealed to you: Clint Eastwood is a crusty old fight manager whose latest client decides to bail out on him, so when a feisty and determined girly boxer named Maggie (Hillary Swank) shows up at his gym and begs him to train her, he eventually agrees after first putting her off. The girl becomes a really good fighter, knocking all the competition out in the first round, but ultimately meets her match in a dirty-fighting opponent who breaks her neck in the ring and sentences her to a fate at the hospital, where she loses her will to live.

Here we have another one of those non-deserving Best Picture Winners. Let's not get carried away here -- the film is ""pretty good"" at best, and certainly watchable, but this is nothing more than a retread of so many other boxing and heart-tugging tearjerkers that I'm surprised so many embraced it. All I can guess is that a lot of people never saw the ROCKY films, LOVE STORY or TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. This is a familiar old tale: ""Struggling boxer wants to be managed by the best, and an aging old trainer wants one more shot so he hesitantly accepts the challenge. And then, toss in a heaping helping of sudden tragedy from other tearjerkers which causes everyone to pull out their handkerchiefs and Kleenex"". The End.

The assets of the film come from the performances of Eastwood, Swank, and also the dependable Morgan Freeman, along with heart and soul and a collection of characters that really relate to one another well. Clint's trainer in particular is given a complex nature, as he goes to church every day to talk to his priest and is haunted by the mistakes he feels he's made during his years. But Swank's Maggie turns out to be a real phony in the end, as she decides that life without one of her limbs is no longer worth living. I don't have a problem with that decision in and of itself, but up to this point we've been hit over the head again and again that Maggie is one tough cookie who never says ""no"" and doesn't stop fighting. I didn't buy for a minute that she'd give up the real fight of her life when the going really got tough.",6

4 May 2012,"""Instead of running from the pain""","While sports movies have never been a major genre, boxing movies have probably accounted for more than half of all sports movies ever made. It must just be something about the idea of boxing basically being an organised punch-up, or maybe the scope for philosophising about the spectacle of violence, that has rendered it the stuff of drama.

But conversely to the usual male pride arena of the typical boxing picture, Million Dollar Baby sees Clint Eastwood settling into a father-daughter dynamic as an ageing trainer with his protégé Hilary Swank. Eastwood's acting has improved as he's aged. He's become less active, so his whole persona has receded back into his face. All his past roles are written there in that tortured visage, a former tough guy trapped in this old man's body, facing difficulty and failure for the first time. Swank gives a deceptively quiet performance for someone playing a boxer. What she's doing is matching Eastwood's steely, laconic demeanour, albeit with a good deal of youthful optimism. The rapport between the two of them seems completely natural.

All boxing matches look more or less alike, but ways of shooting them have differed from one movie to the next. Martin Scorsese's direction in Raging Bull was the much-lauded camera-in-the-ring approach. Eastwood's camera on the other hand is often prowling around the edge -the manager's position – the ropes half obscuring the screen. Throughout the movie there seems to be an emphasis on low ceilings, dark corners, and long, barren hallways. It's a seedy, gritty world these characters inhabit, a world with few exits.

For all its modernity and plot twists Million Dollar Baby fits a well-worn mould. Most of the great boxing movies are about failure of sorts, and perhaps victory of other sorts. And there's no shame in its sticking to the pattern; it's what makes good boxing movies good. Million Dollar Baby is part of a cinematic tradition, and a worthy heir to its predecessors.",9

But other than that, Clint Eastwood's talent for acting and even more so directing really shows with this movie. It was an amazing film to watch and you were routing for his character every step of the way, along with what was best for Hillary Swank's character. Morgan Freeman did a fantastic job too as always and so much of the production was done profoundly.

12 February 2005,One of the best movies ever,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

13 July 2005,one of the best movies of all time,"This movie is the best boxing movie since the movie rocky the films about how a woman (Hilary Swank) who wants to be a boxer and then after some persuasion a man (Clint Eastwood) decides to train her.This movie has to be one of the best movies of 2004 if not all time and Hilary Swank does an amazing acting performance in this movie and so do Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman.I recommend this film to rent or to buy for $25 or less and this is a must see movie and if u like this movie u should see the movie rocky.Over all this film was GREAT with no boring bits and it keep me entertained from start to finish and my rating is 8 and a half out of 10.

18 May 2005,"A Wonderful, and Important Film","As I sat through ""Million Dollar Baby"", I was very pleased about the quality of the film as a whole. Then, the film took a dark turn, and it became a multi-dimensional film, one that I will never forget. The acting, writing, directing, music, and even the lighting of the film was perfect for what it was. I happen to agree with the choices of the characters of the film. Does that make me biased?, I don't think so, because if you really think about it, nobody wins. It's about bonds that we make with people. An unspoken love that we have for the people that we connect with in life. Clint Eastwood is a master. He has proved that throughout his career. With ""Baby"", he not only shows us his mastery as a director, but a spot-on acting job as the grumpy gym owner. This IS his masterpiece. Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always as Scraps. I can't imagine the film without his narration. The film, though, belongs to Hilary Swank. She is both mentally and physically perfect for Maggie. Swank makes you fall in love with Maggie, makes you cheer her on in the fight scenes. Swank brings that character to life. She is honest in every way in her acting. I was sooooo happy when ""Million Dollar Baby"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Thank You Academy!!! This is a beautiful, haunting film. If you haven't seen it yet, go now!",10
16 January 2006,I have some questions,"Why wasn't the fight stopped when the 'champ' took the -first- blatant ultra-cheap shot, (hitting the opponent already down), -especially- after she'd been repeatedly warned for -much- lesser offenses? Why wasn't the corner going nuts trying to get the fight stopped? Why weren't the -judges- demanding that the ref stop the fight? I know the movie is focused on other matters, but a just little bit of police action after the ATTEMPTED MURDER in the ring would have been nice. Why did her hospital-visiting mother say that she ""lost"" the fight? Why did Franky say she ""didn't win"" the fight? Are they saying she was disqualified for not being able to continue? Is this some kind of a joke? Am I missing something here? There must be a way to make the villain a villain without straining suspension of disbelief so severely. This,after all, was not a movie about professional wrestling. How can these absurd errors be tolerated by so many reviewers?

23 March 2005,A million dollar question,"Million Dollar Baby... a good film? Yes. Good enough to be the year's best picture? I have my doubts. Don't think it deserves the best picture Oscar, although the best director, actress and supporting actor awards were richly deserved.

Clint Eastwood has always been an intense character, whether in his acting or in his film-making. He displays his vast directing experience and channels it out well through his own, as well as his co-stars' acting performances. Hilary Swank once again shows that she is in complete control and command of the tough characters she takes on, snagging another Oscar after Boys Don't Cry. The danger though is that she runs the risk of being typecast for such masculine roles and limits her versatility, thus restricting her from taking on other roles. To me, Morgan Freeman is the one who truly deserves his accolade. It's tough to find such a humble and well-respected actor in plastic Hollywood, and even tougher for him to put in such understated but highly influential and impressionable presence in every show he has been in. His superb touches in gems such as the Shawshank Redemption and Driving Miss Daisy alone more than makes up for the many crap films he has taken a part in.

So why is it that the film, with masterful directing and convincing performances from the actors, fail to stir up my emotions? I hope I have the answer, but even I'm stumped. It's just one of those movies that has almost everything, yet a vital 'something' is lacking and leaves you feeling not completely satisfied with it. Perhaps it's the way the show gradually ended... it could have taken a tad too long, which could have taken away much of the emotional impact it had intended to make.

Who should watch: Fans of superb acting and audiences with the patience to sit through lenghty and intense dialogue

Who shouldn't watch: Boxing fans, because there isn't really that much punching going on

Rating: 7.9",7
14 November 2021,Structured Very Welly,"Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby stirs you slowly and smoothly through a female boxing story, only to jump out of nowhere and literally shatter you emotionally. If this doesn't send buckets of tears down your cheeks, what will? It begins as the typical kind of sports movie, where we're introduced to a woman's journey through boxing. But Million Dollar Baby takes a devastating turn, definitely hyping as something you'd wanna avoid spoilers for.

The best thing about this near-masterpiece is the depressing theme, but on the other hand, the performances are brilliant, too. Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are amazingly perfect. It's almost as if we're witnessing real-life footage of these events. The music is also a frequent, noticeable and beautiful component to the overall effect on its strong-hearted audiences. Whenever you hear it, the tragedy and hope of Million Dollar Baby will immediately set foot in your head.

However, there's reasons why this unforgettable hidden gem isn't a definite masterpiece. Although it's entertaining, gripping, inspiring and loveable, a lot of the messages and themes can be quite clichéd. Those clichés are thankfully the only flaw, but aren't going to leave the list of improvement needed.

16 May 2005,Far from knock-out,"There are some good boxing movies, but they all share the same problems: The boxing scenes aren't realistic. In ""Million Dollar Baby"" we meet the same problem. There are raw swings here, that wouldn't be accepted even by drunken gold miners in the West. It's obvious, also to a boxing ignorant.

But surely Hillary Swank is good and Clint Eastwood too. But until the last half hour, you can't understand all the fuzz about this, except for the famous people who are in it. Swank does the boxing trash broad who fights herself up. You have seen it before, I promise.

But in the end there is a discussion about existentialist matters, that you hadn't expected and Swank is really great here. It doesn't save this picture, but make it bearable.

21 October 2005,The Most Non-Self Indulgent Film Ever Made aka Possibly The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichés and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only Cliché (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichéd at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE.",10

5 July 2005,Million Dollar Baby......Out of this world Great,"I never went to see this film at the picture as I do not like the idea of women boxing, that is something that I really regret now after seeing the film on DVD. There is so much more to this film other than the boxing, in truth it is not the fighting, training or action that has drove me to write this review. If you like your films character driven this is the film for you. Loyalty, courage, friendship, heart, trust, respect and determination are just some of the qualities of the human spirit that are displayed in this film all perfectly narrated and brought together by the great Mr Morgan Freeman. 10/10 not a chance this is one of those film that is really off the scale.

29 March 2005,"More like a thousand dollars, I'd say...","With the pedigree behind this project, and everyone's tendency to love an underdog, it couldn't lose. This should not blind people to one or two glaring flaws that slipped under the radar; all thanks to the public willingness to happily accept a 'pat' story that rings all of the old bells.

There were indeed a boatload of clichés that could almost be found in any number of daytime soap-operas; however, I did like the focus on Clint's character and his shaky confidence - since he's one of the only ones out there still doing 'hard-luck' stories about craggy old men, instead of plucky young dynamos! Put it this way; I can think of many more deserving recipients of Best Picture in the past that somehow missed out. Yet the Academy eats stuff like this up - triumph over adversity/finding redemption. It doesn't surprise me that this nabbed the top award of that year, despite my thinking it may not have been quite worthy...

22 December 2005,this movie has deeply knocked out me!,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is far more than a movie to me: it's just a real piece of life. If you don't feel anything after watching it, you're either dead or lifeless. It's quite difficult to hold your tears back throughout its running time. It's full of sympathetic characters and it is, morally speaking, infinitely more complex than the greater part of current movies. This movie is not primarily about boxing. It's not an essay, it's art, a movie about human beings as close as I expected. It looks like a classic one, full-blooded movies which the characters, the director and the screenplay (regularly written by real writers) were a lot more important than special effects or box office. An interesting movie in itself, because of there are a lot of heartbreaking feelings inside. I have seen this movie several times. The first time I left the movie theater so impressed that I couldn't get out of my head for a while. That's why I bought its stunningly Original Motion Picture Soundtrack three months later. I recovered it on DVD as soon as it released to realize how endearing the relationship between the leading threesome was. Besides, they are losers but they fight to change their spells of bad luck with dignity. For example, Clint Eastwood's character doesn't stop sending letters to his only daughter in spite of the fact they are always send back to him over and over again. They don't lose hope because they insist on getting a second chance for themselves. Sometimes I believe that Clint Eastwood is not who he really is. Maybe he is John Ford reborn. He has taken from the everlasting master the style, the feelings and their reasons for I think old-time movies will never be forgotten. The future looks bright for Clint Eastwood. Even though he's a 75 year-old-film star he's at the top level of his profession thanks to his two latest masterpieces which have been a roaring success all over the world and has no plans to retire, anyway!",9

2 February 2016,Possibly Clint's best film as a director,"""Million Dollar Baby"", the Best Picture Oscar winner for 2004, was the second of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts to claim that prize, the first being ""Unforgiven"". Here, the story concerns a raw but determined female boxer (Hilary Swank) who seeks the aid of a grizzled trainer (Eastwood) in her quest to become a professional.

At first glance, ""Million Dollar Baby"" appears to conform to the standard template for an underdog sports movie; not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, within those parameters, the movie holds its own against the classics of the genre. However, what elevates the movie to another level is the dramatic heft of the unexpected final act. I'm reluctant to divulge any details about the territory that the movie finds itself in but I can say that the story is ultimately satisfying on multiple levels.

As compelling as the story turns out to be, the cast is just as good. Living legends Clint Eastwood & Morgan Freeman shared the screen once again here, reuniting the duo that made ""Unforgiven"" so memorable. They were joined by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, soon to nab another (well deserved) statuette for her work here. Speaking of Oscars, Morgan Freeman finally managed to win one for his wonderfully understated performance and distinctive narration. The movie also offers early glimpses of Jay Baruchel, Anthony Mackie & Michael Peña, not to mention a memorable turn from the always dependable Margo Martindale.

Eastwood's direction isn't too flashy but that suits the movie just fine. The attractive cinematography also supports the film's realistic look. Yet another key piece in the puzzle is the restrained yet affecting score, surprisingly penned by Eastwood himself.

All in all, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner that still endures today as a modern classic. Not just a sports movie, the story defies expectations and successfully tackles some tricky subject matter. My only reservation is that the movie has an old-fashioned feel from time to time but that's really part of Eastwood's style and not worth dwelling on considering all of the things that the movie excels at.",8
29 December 2019,Solid 8,"Clint Eastwood at his best. This might be one of his best all time movies. It's got the punches. I like Clint's character. He is a boxing trainer who's rough but has a sweet spot. Not the richest guy, but he's been around. Freeman had a great performance also. The actress is interesting to watch. I don't think it's too great of a performance or anything memorable. But the story is almost flawless. Fun all the way through and gets you thinking. She tried to achieve so much, and pushed herself so hard, only to end up handicap. Was it all worth it?

You should've already seen it a few times

13 August 2021,Best after long time,"Million Dollar Baby is not that type of sports drama movie which we see now and then. It's so much different. It is one of it's kind.

Everything in this movie; plot, direction, acting, pace setting, tone built-up was great. The scenes between two main leads are so good, you want more. The pace and tone setting was also good. Everything in the movie looked real, not forceful. There was nothing about this movie which I didn't like. The way this movie is made, by the end of the movie you get touched by the movie.

Overall, a treat for movie fans who love sports drama. You must give it a try, if you haven't.

10 June 2006,Eastwood does it again!,"First of all I just wanna say that I hate everything about sports and the reason why I wanted to see it is because Clint Eastwood directed it. And after seeing Mystic River, I wanted to see Million Dollars Baby cause Clint Eastwood is an incredible director that brings the actors in his movies in good light. I had only seen Hilary Swank in Boys don't cry so I didn't knew much about her but she just blew me away. They way she talked and living herself into that part were just amazing. I believed her. She's brilliant for being so young. And giving her an Oscar was the right thing to do. Also, Morgan Freeman. He's so ordinary in that movie and brilliant. You just wanna feel sorry for him for being so alone in the movie. I mean living in the gym? Who wants that? The story is gripping and you just wanna comfort them all. Everything in that movie is so human. It's all about making it through the day no matter how hard that is. And sometimes, you just want it all to take it all in the end but you just need a little help to make that happen. It's all about that. It makes you think what would I've done if I was him or her.

8 September 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"Million Dollar Baby starring Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I think that it deserves most of the awards that it won. This movie is about Maggie,a southern girl who works as a waitress and will take the leftover food from her customer and lie that it is for her dog because she can hardly afford anything for herself. Then she starts to want to box. In the opening scene you see her watching a boxing match. At the end of the fight she tries to talk to one of the managers of one of the boxers to see if he wanted to manage her. He denies her and then the next day she decides to go over to his gym. After she has been at the gym everyday and working very hard, Scraps, Morgan Freeman's character, comes and corrects her on some of her mistakes. Frankie, Clint Eastwood's character, finally manages her. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens next. This is a sad, happy, moving, amazing, and very unpredictable moving movie that shows how much effort and work you have to do to become a great boxer. I recommend it for everyone (even though it is rated PG-13 your kids and kids everywhere should see it), you will end up loving it and it will touch your heart.",10
5 February 2005,Not a review as such.,"To not see this movie based on any comments on this or any other site would be a terrible shame, an opportunity to watch what I consider to be the best movie of the year lost. While not in any way a ""female Rocky"" (who'd wanna see that anyway?, and not a feel good popcorn flick, it's beautifully written, cleverly but simply directed and acted with true passion. To be a good boxing movie is tough, no sport has had more movies made about it, yet Million Dollar Baby succeeds with aplomb. Hilary Swanks portrayal of Maggie is full of joy and love for life, despite hardship, and this contrasts nicely with Eastwoods Frankie, yet ultimately he seems to find some joy in his relationship with Maggie. While not likely to make you smile all the way through, if you don't find yourself smiling a few hours after you leave, you may not have really understood the film, which is ultimately about what all good movies are about, the indomitability of the human spirit, despite the ending. A film about people far, far more than about boxing, this is what makes it so worthy of acknowledgement by the Academy, and by yourselves. Enjoy!

26 June 2016,Mo cuishle,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",8
29 January 2005,Please see this movie!!!,"Clint Eastwood is a master director and with this movie he is at the top of his game. If you liked Clint's directorial efforts in Unforgiven and in Mystic River, you will love his efforts in Million Dollar Baby. Brilliantly acted with Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank at their best, the movie is one of the best movies of the last few years. The three actors all deserve their Academy Award nominations and maybe this is finally the movie that gets Morgan Freeman his long deserved Oscar.

The movie is very poignant and funny at the same time. However, be prepared for a very dark turn in the last 30 minutes of the movie. I was crying at the end and so were many of the rest of the audience.

If there was ever a movie that deserves a 10 (on a scale of 1-10), this is the movie. You will not be disappointed!!!! Please see this movie!!!!

16 July 2006,How does Eastwood do it?,"Time and time again, the old school of Clint Eastwood has demonstrated that quality over quantity is the name of the game in the art of movie making. He manages to pluck winners with a pristine and clarity that would rival any producer/director of age today. He churns them out slowly, but when they arrive at our movie screen doorstep, the reward is well worth the wait.

This movie rivals the effort and result that came from ""Unforgiven"". It will be regarded as a classic modern tragedy in the years to come. No one will forget seeing it. It deserved every Academy accolade it was given, if not short a few more.

Morgan Freeman is the world best supporting actor of all time. Very few have the ability to debate this fact. No one fits this role better, or has mastered it better than he. Don't believe me? Rent ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Seven"", ""The Power of One"". Hell, you could even rent ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" for all I care for the sake of argument. He shines even in a weak film.

For Hiliary Swank, all I can say is that I misjudged her early. This woman was made for intense dramas. I had earlier thought that Hollywood propped her up as what was ""in"", but she has time and again since ""Boys Don't Cry"", proved me wrong. She is the real deal, and she has one hell of a career still ahead of her to dominate the industry and the acting peer space as one of the best of her generation.",9
27 July 2005,Not a knockout but a solid effort,"In some ways Million Dollar Baby is as simple as movies get. It's a story about three people. And one of the three seems to be there really just to tell you some things you otherwise might not know about the other two. The two principals in question are aging boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood who also directs, and the aspiring female boxer he will soon train, Maggie Fitzgerald, played wonderfully by Hilary Swank. The only other character of any great significance, played by Morgan Freeman, is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Scrap, a former boxer himself, now helps Frankie with the operation of his rather seedy boxing gym. But perhaps more importantly for the film, Scrap serves as the narrator who tells us things about Frankie and Maggie that otherwise would have taken too long to flesh out. We get to know Frankie and Maggie as much through what Scrap tells us about them as by what we see them doing ourselves.

The three main characters are brought together by boxing but it's really not a boxing movie. It's more about the life's journey of Maggie Fitzgerald and how Frankie, a man near the end of his own journey, will help her fulfill her destiny. Maggie and Frankie's unlikely partnership drives the movie forward and Swank and Eastwood each do a great job in bringing their characters to life. As the determined and somewhat naive underdog Swank shines. Very few actresses would have been able to handle the emotion and the physicality of this role. Swank absolutely nails it. Eastwood's character has a lot bubbling under the surface and initially we're not really sure if we should like this guy. But despite his initial misgivings (he is very emphatic in stating that he doesn't train girls), Maggie brings out the best in him. They have an unusual but undeniably strong bond and they go on a fascinating journey together.

The story is an intriguing one, the characters are compelling and the acting, from Swank especially, is excellent. But Million Dollar Baby seems to lack a certain energy driving the film forward. For much of the film it seems we're just biding time waiting for the inevitable climactic fight. And that climactic fight? Well, it's how shall we say, quite interesting, and certainly puts a different spin on all that has come before. Part of the charm of movies is in delivering the unexpected but I'm not sure how many will be charmed by the climactic events here. In the end, Million Dollar Baby is certainly powerful, thought-provoking and full of emotion. No all-time classic but a fine story well worth seeing.",7

24 September 2020,The most depressing movie (not the quality but the story),"This feeling.. a sense of depression lingers on for while. I did not cry but was deeply sad and hit the bottom of that emotion. 'Million Dollar Baby' hit me so hard and amplified hopelessness as time goes on even after the movie like an ink dropped on the water. Typically, most literatures (not just movie but also books, plays, or operas) incorporate poetic justice. The good triumphing over the evil. However, Maggie is so desperate, gives all her best, and is nothing but kind; however, she does not triumph over the fate. The thing that makes me sadder is that it so much happens in real life.

'Million Dollar Baby' is a great movie because it wakes up emotions, makes them roar, and engulfs me. That's what movie should be about, making people FEEL.

23 December 2010,A very sincere drama,"So many years down the line, Clint Eastwood has proved that he still has what it takes to be a great actor, as well as director. Million Dollar Baby is one of his finest efforts, so much so that he took home the best director and best picture Oscars for the film. The film is about fictional female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, who wants nothing more than to make it to the top and to be the best. To do so, she convinces hard boiled Frankie Dunn to train her. The two become like father and daughter as Maggie becomes better and better. It is a very sincere and dramatic movie. It is not light hearted by any means and is successful at being serious without being pretentious. It is a very good film.

In one sentence this film is a dramatic character study. It is very emotional but also very smart. The story is very rich with sincere dialouge to drive it. The characters are all real for the most part. There is some melodrama, but it is always fitting for the morose dramatic tone of the film. The film is definitely not a happy one. It can be uplifting in some respects, but overall it is very depressing, but very real. It doesn't provide all the satisfaction we want in a happy ending. It doesn't try to brighten things up just to give us some sort of cathartic relief. It develops very emotionally and with utmost sincerity. It's rough but it's worth it.

The film is very well driven by great characters played by a very high quality cast. Clint Eastwood is at his emotionally charged best here. He plays the detached Frankie Dunn who is weary about training a girl at first, but grows to love her like a daughter. Their relationship is beautiful and so compelling. Hilary Swank does a fantastic job as Maggie. Her and Eastwood have a lot of chemistry and it keeps the film at a highly emotional level. Morgan Freeman plays the washed up ex-boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris and his performance as well as the character himself is amazing. He plays this tragic role with such focus and sincerity. He is a sad character and it so easy to love Morgan Freeman that we feel a lot of empathy for his character as he develops. Then of course there is one final reveal in the last line of the film that rounds out his character so perfectly and, while not resolving anything, still provides some sort of hope in the bleak reality the characters find themselves in at the end of this film.

I can understand why some people wouldn't like this film. It can seem unrealistic and over-dramatic at times, but in the big picture, it is all fitting. The film doesn't try to be anything more than the dramatic piece of cinema it is. It still provides a great story with emotionally compelling characters. The only problem I had with the film was one storyline point that was left completely unresolved by the end of the film. I would have to give away too much to explain it, but it is something that should have at least been mentioned. Other than that I found this film to be a very sincere piece of dramatic cinema that was very well made in every aspect.",8

28 August 2005,Thank God for Clint Eastwood.,"Thank God for Clint Eastwood. Every time I am tempted to despair of the American cinema industry, along comes Clint with one of his masterpieces. In this film, he starred, directed and produced. He even composed the music ! Clint Eastwood has a gift for avoiding the typical Hollywood clichés and superficialities without sounding pompous and yet manages to reach the true depth of any given situation. His films avoids any distraction which would not help the story along. This film is long - over 130 minutes - but it seemed short to me. The very tragic ending of this film could easily have been mishandled, but Clint keeps it simple, concentrating on the essentials. For the first time in years, I admit that I cried. Eastwood also made me doubt for the first time about my moral positions on euthanasia. I am still against it, but readily admit that reality has a way of creating situations which are more complex than what a philosopher would imagine. The main actors, Clint Eastwood along with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, are all simply superb. Now we expect that from veterans like Eastwood and Freeman, but Hilary Swank was an agreeable surprise, at least for me. She is a stunning actress and I hope she will be given other opportunities to star in quality films. Won't Hollywood ever learn ? Don't 'they' ever watch films made by Clint Eastwood ?",10

9 January 2005,Once In A Blue Moon Movie!,"I see a LOT of movies being both in the business,and being someone who loves being in a dark theater and being transported to another time and place. I'll just state here that I had nothing occupationally to do with this film, although I wish I had.

The sad thing is that most often, something is either over-done or under-done in the films that make it to the market. Usually, it's the script that hasn't quite been thought through and finessed.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a once in a blue moon type of movie that satisfies the audience member in pretty much every way possible. The story in the script is strong, and most important, simply told. It is essentially about a man who has lost his ability to give both support and independence to others due to a failed relationship with his daughter. It's about a young girl who is so driven toward what she wants, that she affects others around her. And essentially, it's about the man learning to let go when he needs to.

The scenes are shot with such care, just the right length, just the right amount of dialog, just the right amount of information, and just the right amount of emotion from the actors, that I must congratulate the director for doing what so many strive for, and so few are unable to do.

I also think that the cinematography is beautiful in this film. When I think back, I feel like I saw a beautiful black and white film. This tells me that the Director of Photography must have taken care to look for interesting shapes with light and shadow to create a sort of film-noire ambiance in many scenes.

I have recommended this film to everyone I know.",

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",
29 December 2009,2 hours well spent!,"I'd been watching a lot of shallow movies of late, the depths being American Pie present: The Book of Love, which put me off Hollywood movies for a bit.

However, I remembered this movie garnering a lot of critical acclaim and winning an Oscar, so I watched it and, I have to say, it was the best movie I'd seen in quite some time.

In a nutshell, the movie's about how a rural girl comes and experiences basically everything a person could possibly experience in their life.

That line, however, does not do justice to what a good movie it is.

Morgan Freeman's narration is really good, but Hillary Swank's acting is absolutely what you'd expect of an innocent girl who hasn't been through the evils of life. Clint Eastwood does enough to convince me to somehow get all his other movies and watch them.

However, the ending could've been a bit better, which is the reason for the missing star. To give you a modern-day example, you could compare the ending to Law-Abiding Citizen.

However, don't let this put you off the movie as the preceding 1 hours and 40 minutes are absolutely top class, covering up, to a large extent, for the ending.",9
12 March 2015,Nicely done drama about a VERY interesting subject.,"Million Dollar Baby is half boxing movie, and half... Something else (I don't want to give away spoilers). If you go in expecting inspiring Rocky-type heroics, you're going to be VERY disappointed. If on the other hand, you want a moving, sombre experience who two of America's great modern day actors (Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, in case you haven't guessed) and Hilary Duff matching her amazing turn in Boys Don't Cry as a female boxer, then step this way.

The relationship between Duff and Eastwood forms the centrepiece of the film... She comes from a rubbish family, and is reduced to stealing leftovers from the cafe where she works just to eat. All the money she does make goes towards her dream... Which is to be a professional fighter. Eastwood is a gruff, dismissive owner of a local gym... Who doesn't believe girls should fight and that at 31, she's too old anyway. But she insists on bothering him, until he reluctantly agrees to train her... And as they begin to spend time together, she becomes sort of a surrogate daughter to him. Seeing as how he made such a pig's ear of his ties towards his flesh and blood one...

Some of the dialogue exchanges feel a little too calculated in the context of the film and a few situations seem a bit overly 'set up' for maximum dramatic impact, as opposed to feeling authentic. Nevertheless, this is an extremely involving two hours, whether it be the brilliantly directed ringside sequences, or the well maintained interaction between the three main stars. And when the shift focuses to... Something else in the devastating third passage of the script, get those hankies out. The acting muscles REALLY emerge, and we see why this cast is so renowned.

Seriously, get the Kleenex along with the popcorn. You'll need it. 7/10",7
30 January 2022,eh,"I mean it's another clint movie. Well made and all, but also a certain slyle that isn't for everybody. Personally the story felt a little tryhard. All in all, it wasn't that good.

9 February 2005,The baby who can't reach the million dollar target,"Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's most recent appearance on big screen after Bloodwork. Witb the strong cast of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman together with Eastwood himself, it was supposed to be one of his best films he made.

However, i would say i prefer his previous production, Mystic River.

Million Dollar Baby is more of a journey of how Maggie Fitzgerald, which was portrayed by Hilary Swank, becomes a female boxer, whom she insisted to be trained by ex-fighter, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), who now runs a old gym, together with his previous fighter, Eddie Scrap (Freeman). This somehow goes a distance from what the plot should be.

Million Dollar Baby do not have the suspense of Mystic River, but magnifies the ugliness of human being. From the style of how the boxer fights, the training session in the gym to Maggie mother's attitude on preferring money over a new house when Maggie bought a new house for her family members, Eastwood brings in the ugliness to the audience through the group of less fortunates social level.

Hilary Swank makes another excellent performance after her award winning role in Boy's Don't Cry. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, seems to be suffering from malnutrition in terms of dialogue. He doesn't have much dialogue in the film, and neither did he make any breakthrough performances. However, he narrates the film, which will be discuss later.

Now back to Eastwood. His performance as a former boxer cum Maggie's coach has not been affected by his 'cowboy image' from his previous well-known cowboy shows. But in terms of direction, it brings back the wordy dialogue, minus the suspense.

What makes the movie watchable was the narration by Freeman. Beginning with how Eastwood becomes a trainer, Freeman tells the story of the main characters through his eyes and his experience. If the film was narrated by Eastwood, it would gives us another side of the story, which can make Million better.

In all, the baby fails to earn an million, but managed to earned 3/5 of a million.

There are times where",6
21 May 2007,This won movie of the year?????,"Unbelievable that this type of movie would win so many awards. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The content was as depressing as depressing can get. And many parts of the movie were UNREAL; they didn't ring true. It was contrived dialogue and inappropriate emotions.

Let's start with boxing. Boxing is a brutal sport and how anyone can get excited about people knocking the crap out of each other and risking serious injury is beyond me.

Then the entire second part of the movie was about the fallen champ becoming a bedridden vegetable. Depressing all the way to the end! Of course, Clint wants to help her out of sheer guilt. So he somehow forces himself to pull the plug despite any legal consequences and despite the fact she IS conscious. Unreal. Didn't buy it for a minute.

I also didn't buy her family. There are redneck hillbillies and then there are just people with absolutely no moral fibre, good judgment or sensitivity in their body. Her ENTIRE family was the latter. Nobody's entire family is that bad.

Piece of contrived, depressing art is all this movie was. And I like Clint. My friend's Irish old dad is a dead ringer for him.",6
14 September 2021,Fighting Spirit,"Million Dollar Baby is a strong contender when it comes to well-executed, emotionally driven dramas. While I am not a big Clint Eastwood fan (I think his acting is stiff and too recited) the performances all around were phenomenal. There was a fighting spirit and a true drive at the core of this film. Every scene had purpose and each performance knew the endgame.

Even when the film took unexpected turns (especially when the film took unexpected turns), I was on the edge of my seat, eager to see what would happen next.

29 January 2005,Fine Movie,"This film certainly deserves the Oscar nomination and to my mind is a better movie than The Aviator.

The film focuses on a wannabe boxer who like most boxers is from a poor background. The only difference here is that the boxer in question is a woman. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) wants Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to be her manager. He doesn't want to manage a woman, but I don't think it's giving too much away to say that he finally takes her on.

One of the best things about this film is that the boxing is realistically shot and the fact that it's womens boxing doesn't feel out of place. Whilst Swank deservedly takes the honours for acting, Eastwood and Freeman are as dependable as ever. The final act is very well played and if you're into fell good movies I'd steer clear of this. 8/10

26 January 2005,Wonderful Masterwork from Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood knows how to craft a story with human relationships and emotion as the framework. This is a beautiful piece of acting, screen writing, cinematography, and directing. It is tragic but always uplifting. I loved every minute of ""Million Dollar Baby"". Hilary Swank gives a strong, very human performance. She is able to carry the weight of her back story in her shoulders and is able to communicate triumph with her face alone. Clint Eastwood does give the performance of his career as the aged trainer of Swank's character. I found Morgan Freeman's ""Scrap"" is the best supporting character he has done since ""Shawshank Redemption"". Wonderful, subtle, unobtrusive screen writing lets the character's stories develop at a slower, more human, very touching way. The best film of the year.

28 September 2021,I don't watch boxing but I like good boxing dramas,"Clint Eastwood might be my number one favorite movie-making-guy. Because he's a both a great actor and director, and he has also done very different kind of movies from macho action thrillers and westerns to emotional dramas.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a title I've seen a...million...times everywhere but probably never watched the movie before. It starts a bit Rocky style but the plot is original and very moving.

Besides mr. Eastwood, Hillary Swank does a great role as the young boxer who needs a coach. Then there's also Morgan Freeman as a side character. Great cast.

I don't have more to say that it's a very strong drama even if you're not interested in sports in the first place. And it made me even more Eastwood fan.

21 February 2005,Bravo!,"Clint Eastwood really has become an extremely skilled director. It amazes me how he can put so much emotion, depth and feeling, into what really is just a simple story, with simple characters. He did it last year with Mystic River, and again he triumphs this year with Million Dollar Baby.

Very moving, totally flawless movie. I can't really think of one thing that I didn't like. Most things people will not like about this movie are things that really have nothing to do with what this movie is trying to achieve. This is a character driven movie, not a plot one. It is not trying to be true to the real world of boxing or any other inaccuracies people might find. Don't take everything that happens so literally. This is a movie about a man ridden with guilt searching for redemption, and a lost woman looking to find herself and find acceptance and love from a ""parental"" figure. Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank, along with all of the supporting characters deliver on every level.

Even though I loved this movie a lot. I still wouldn't give it the Oscar. Aviator and DiCaprio should get it. Although Mystic should have beat out LOTR last year (*ducks from all the LOTR fans gunning for him*)",
19 April 2005,Top rate movie,"I am not a fan of boxing movies in any shape or form & only watched this as it was given to me to view on DVD from overseas. I was very surprised at the interest it held from the very beginning. The acting was excellent & the characters fully believable while the story showed the results of determination & dedication. It is easy to see why Hilary won the Oscar for her outstanding performance. Seeing the background from where our heroine evolved adds to the degree of admiration at her determination & will power to succeed in a sport that is very competitive & one that by all reason she has passed the expiry date as she is competing with much younger fighters. The message here is strong also the message of faith in others as she fully believes that only one trainer is going to get her where she knows she is capable of being. People taking chances on others is always open to good interpretation & is very well done in this movie. Although a long movie it is very sad when the story actually ends. I have recommended this movie to all who will listen.

30 April 2005,Uplifting Yet Sad..Not typical Eastwood Fare...,"this is the kind of movie you have to see only once. Not like any of Clint Eastwoods other movies, either as director or actor, where the 25th viewing is as enjoyable as the first! This one hits you so deep in the gut(pardon the boxing pun) that once is definitely plenty. You will most likely never forget it. There have been only a few movies so sad and so heartfelt that the emotional chord it strikes leaves you in such a state you don't want to go there again. Kind of like a funeral for someone you loved. I sincerely admire Hillary Swank as an actress. Her 2 most amazing roles that both won her Oscars, have her dying in the end. She does it better than anyone. She has a humanity to her roles that reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at her best. The only other actress I know today that has this same quality is Natalie Portman. Watch her amazing performance at the age of 13 in The Professional. It is like she and Hillary are cast from the same amazing mold. MDB is a great movie. It may have an ending some may not agree is right, but it fits. It almost seemed like 2 different movies. A Rocky type of story at first, then a story about the issue of life. I highly suggest watching it once. That is all you will need.",10
21 March 2006,Just A Few Words,"This is a great film to see once. Acting by cast is always in the moment. Feelings evoked are operatic in scale, and humanely humble. Narration is authoritative, precise, and penetrating. The stories, by F.X. Toole, on which the film is based, richly reveal the true grit of human nature. The boxing is as good as that in Cinderella Man. That is good.

There three major characters in this film. Freeman, as Scrap, doubles as the narrator. Whenever he narrates, his voice brings authority, precision, and penetration to each and every word.

Eastwood, as Frankie, doubles as director, and writes much of the haunting score.

Swank, as Maggie, has to deal with a character not quite as finely-drawn as the heroine of Girl Fight, but she, like Eastwood, brings pathos to many scenes that require ""doing nothing, very well."" She reaches peaks of performance she aimed for in Boys Don't Cry. She brings authenticity to the role of Maggie, the poor girl struggling hard to overcome poverty.

They all earned Oscars for their work.

Some of the dialog in Million Dollar Baby is terse, telling, and subtly beautiful. For example, Scrap tells Frankie that people die every day thinking they never got their shot. It is a short speech, but worthy of the line of poetry about people leading lives of quiet desperation. It should remain in the living language for quite some time.

The film may suffer, however, from the rash decision by director Clint Eastwood, to shoot from what was essentially screen writer Paul Haggis' rough draft. On repeat viewing, some of the longer scenes that evoke true empathy the first time seem to drag. The whole work then becomes clunky and manipulative.

On the DVD, the bonus features are great!",8

11 January 2006,the best laid plans of..............,"i don't see what everyone is all up in arms over this movie about. true the actors do fine jobs in their given rolls but the movie seems like a cross pollination of rocky and Of Mice And Men. The hints that are dropped throughout the movie of what is coming at the end seem pretty clear and so the end doesn't come as much of a surprise. Clint Eastwood is great as Burgess Meredith and Morgan Freeman plays the same roll he plays in every movie, that of the aged, wise, and world weary man with hints of narration. If Freeman wasn't so good at playing the roll it would be unforgivable but try seeing if his roll from Glory, or Se7en, or Shawshank, or Unforgiven, or Kiss The Girls, is any different.....

What really leaves a foul taste in the mouth and holds this movie back is the utter lack of reconciliation. The only bit of it comes between Freeman and a cocky young boxer. I'm shallow i like vengeance in film and too many characters do to many evil or annoying things without some sort of closure. The dirty boxer, the ex-con punk kid, the lazy mother, et cetera.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
30 January 2005,Not as great as I expected!,"i went to see this film expecting it to be amazing like a lot of people say but, having seen it i would rate it as an average film.

The first problem is that the acting is so underplayed that, as an audience member, i found it hard to really feel any connection to the characters. If i had, perhaps i would have cried but i didn't, i just felt like a distanced spectator. Clint Eastwood, as a withdrawn boxing owner played his part well, the problem was just that, he was withdrawn. Realism in film is good to a point, here it was overdone.

However the film was well made and kept my attention throughout. Hilary Swanks portrayal of a gutsy boxer probably does deserve an Oscar nomination.

Overall a good film, but overrated, and there are films/actors out there far more deserving of academy awards - not that that makes a difference.

8 January 2005,Disappointment: Ruined by Bad Ending,"I'll avoid spoilers at the beginning of this review. MDB was well-acted and directed and had me interested in the story up until the ""twist,"" which took the film in a different direction for the final 45 minutes.

An important element in a good film is being able to make the viewer care about and sympathize with the protagonists. MDB lost me and I stopped caring about the main characters because of some of the decisions that they made near the end of the film. MDB tries to be a drama, but a number of unrealistic scenes make it play more like a melodramatic comic book. One scene, in particular, involving Morgan Freeman, is laughable in its lack of believability. In the end, the film comes off as being preachy. Out of the blue, it tackles a controversial societal topic and tries to force its point of view upon the audience. In doing so, it betrays the integrity of the film and ruins everything good that had built up to that point. The last half hour was torturous to watch and just dragged on at a needlessly slow pace.

***SPOILERS BELOW*** I get the feeling that the intention of MDB was to make a case for euthanasia all along and just use the boxing story as a disguise. I strongly disagree with the message of the film: that it is better to die as a championship boxer than to live a life in a wheelchair. The film is a slap in the face to all those who have achieved great things after paralysis, such as Christopher Reeve. Maggie could have used her celebrity status to go on to do great things and raise money and awareness for her condition, as Reeve did. Instead, she makes a terrible decision. I am truly baffled as to why some people applaud the films ending or are emotionally moved by Maggie's death.

On a final note, I am not against euthanasia, per se. I think it depends on the situation. For example, in ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,"" I was deeply moved when the Chief took Jack's life at the end, and I agreed with the decision. This was a case of someone who had a lobotomy and had his personality robbed of him. Maggie, on the other hand, had her personality and intellect still in tact, which is more important than her body.

27 January 2005,I am speechless!,"This film is remarkable! The actors are using real people dialogue with no cutesy standard fight expressions or expletives.

If I were a member of SAG I would vote for this film in EVERY category in a heartbeat.

Eastwood's musical compositions were perfect and Bruce Forman's solo guitar was expressive and poignant.

I recommend that everyone go see this film.

Hilary Swank was playing herself. She is every bit as selfless and kind as her portrayal. It is so refreshing to see a woman of her age with such grace and simple beauty devoid of ego.

14 October 2006,overrated movie which is predictable after the 2nd act.,"I must say that I am really disappointed that this movie got the best picture Oscar. It starts as a promising movie, the opening act is wonderful. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is a young adult woman who is trying to be a professional boxer asking help from an old, experienced boxing coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Eddie (Morgan Freeman) is Frankie's right-hand and possibly the only one who really understands him. Frankie is haunted by guilt about something happened between him and his daughter in the past and he is reluctant to coach Maggie. But Maggie has been through many hardships and is not a quitter. She is determined to get where she wants and she is willing to do what others are not (actually this is from a sign in the gym they are working out: winners are willing to do what loser are not). Soon enough, she wins Frankie's heart and Frankie finally warms up to the idea of coaching a female boxer. Maggie, in a way, could be thought of as a ""female Rocky"" as she, too, is an underdog, someone who is poor, had many hardships but willing to fight until the end (only, unlike Rocky, it's a she). Then the championship games begin and after the 1st act is over, the movie takes a tumble. From then on, everything is downhill and very predictable. I can honestly say that I knew everything that was going to happen in the last 45 minutes of the movie. I could have walked out the theatre and wouldn't have missed a thing. Because everything that happened in the last act was just predictable. There was no room in the story for any improvement. It's like the plot has been decapacitated. It was very painful to watch. I felt all the buttons that the director was trying to push to activate emotions. They were just too obvious and in our face. Overall, this is not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar.",7

The performances from Swank, Eastwood and Freeman are gritty and nuanced. The music score is memorable. It is just perfect in every possible measure.

Story is solid, maybe overused, maybe simple, maybe easy to imagine... but the Story is so solid, no fissures... pure rock! Actors in this film are just incredible. Clint, Morgan, the boxing lady... OMG! I just can't imagine how to run a character better than Clint or Morgan do. They are so incredible that they made me cry like a little girl when watching this film 2x and 3x. This film will make you to think for sure. This film will make you to think about when and how watching it again... and this film will make you think about life, about family, about love, about diseases, about... check yourself!

23 November 2022,Million Dollar Baby is an extremely well-done film that takes an abrupt turn to deal with incredibly sobering subjects that are definitely not what I thought I signed up for.,"I know it's supposedly a masterpiece, and I will lose some cred for saying this, but Million Dollar Baby was a dreadful movie. I spent the first half of the film falling in love with the hopeful, talented, and inspiring Maggie Fitzgerald and her redeeming of the cranky and lonely trainer, Frankie Dunn. But when the second half takes its giant turn, the story shifts from an endearing sports narrative about overcoming opposition and redemption to hopelessness and agony. Clint Eastwood directed a powerful story with impressive mastery, but the subject matter robbed the film of any enjoyment. For many, Million Dollar Baby deserved Best Picture at the Oscars. For me, I wish The Incredibles had claimed that victory.

6 March 2005,Outstanding would be an understatement,"This movie had just about everything a viewer could possibly want. There are very few movies I see that I think deserve the awards they receive, but million dollar baby more than earned the four ( I believe it was four) academy awards it received. I think just about everyone is expecting a ""Rocky"" style plot with a female for the twist, and at first it seems as if it might be just that, but in a good way. You quickly realize, however, that this movie takes it's place among the truly greats, with more than just a twist of originality. This movie is not a modern ""Rocky"". Clint Eastwood is a genius in his own. As for Ms. Swank, the only other work of hers I am familiar with is the fourth Karate Kid, but after her performance in million dollar baby I think we will all be seeing a lot more of her.

20 December 2012,Eastwood at his best,"Clearing the best picture award in the 77th academy Award is a film that makes you smile and cry at the same time. The movie's twist ending is what makes it a grand slam and Hilary Swank, finally after a long time pulled out a role that can be said to match the one she performed in the 1999 drama Boys Don't Cry. She also won an Academy Award for best actress twice one for Boys Don't Cry in 1999 and the other for her role here in Million Dollar Baby.

The movie is about a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who helped an underdog amateur boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) achieve her dream. Frankie only decided to help Maggie when she persisted to keep training at his gym till Dunn finally deciding to help her to become a professional boxer.

All with the aim that when she is up on her feet he will give her up to another manager, during training Dunn always tells Maggie to defend herself at all times.

Morgan Freeman's inclusion in this movie is one that makes you know that a film with this guy as your supporting actor is going to be a hit. Freeman managed to shine behind the huge shadow of Clint Eastwood and he delivered my favorite scene in the movie, where his character Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, an elderly former boxer and Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) partner, who is blind in one eye went into the ring to take on a younger boxer who had just bullied and knocked the wind out of an autistic young man. Dupris steps in the ring and squares out with the younger boxer who was hesitant ay first to go toe to toe with an old man, but later decided to square it out. After he (the younger boxer) has given the one eyed blind Dupris enough jabs in the face, Dupris landed only one punch and well, the younger boxer learnt a lesson he will never forget.

The movie does have its controversy, as the trailers makes you think this is a movie about a fighter who managed to conquer some fits to become great, when actually it is a tragedy waiting to happen. The movie's ending too is not without its nay-sayers, who feel the ending was just too sad and it mocked and gave the wrong idea for what to do about your disability.

Whether you get all depressed although the movie or you applaud the great movie for its insightful portrayal on female boxing or maybe you are like me who just love a good movie and give it is due credit, one thing is, you have to see Million dollar Baby yourself to come to a better conclusion.

8 September 2020,One of the Most Emotional Movies of All Time; Has Some Trouble With Pacing and Tone,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a movie that will definitely subvert expectations and leave you a more emotionally engaged than you first thought. The first hour or so kind of just feels like a female version of ""Rocky"", or any other number of under-dog sports movies. It's definitely well-produced though, just kind of generic and straightforward. What really makes this one memorable is the last hour and the ending, which both took me completely by surprise. Definitely not in a bad way, and honestly the movie's much better for it. It would have been extremely forgettable otherwise. The biggest problem is the slow start; I feel like a good half hour of the film could have been cut out and we probably would have been given a better paced movie.

Frankie (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxing trainer who has no interest in teaching women how to fight. Maggie (Hilary Swank) persistently asks for his training, which he consistently refuses. It is only due to the request of Eddie (Morgan Freeman), Frankie's friend and employee, that Frankie reluctantly agrees to begin training Maggie. She slowly begins to fight her way to the top of the women's welterweight class before she is given a shot at the world title.

My previous criticisms aren't a knock on the film's overall quality; it's a phenomenal, moving work of art that I definitely recommend. It is very moving and emotional, but bear in mind that you will have to wait until the second half to really cut into the juicy emotional bits of the movie. Not that the first half is bad, it just feels very lacking when compared to the second.",9
20 February 2005,One big joke...,"Is this one big joke I'm not in on? I can understand how people might like LOTR (although I thought the series was...boring), but Million Dollar Baby was just horrible. I don't think Eastwood could have jammed more over-used clichés in if he tried. Morgan Freeman played the same character he does in every movie these days (I actually laughed out loud when I heard he was nominated for an Oscar). The writing was awful, the acting was bad...so why did everyone like it??? Some brilliant ""foreign films"" have come out, but the award shows group them into one category...so we are left with pathetic attempts at cinema like this to celebrate.

18 February 2023,Together with Rocky the Best Boxing Movie!,"I've been waiting a long time to get the chance to watch this movie. Winner of four oscars including best picture, Clint Eastwood as director and actor and several recommendations by friends. I had high expectations.

After watching it, I can definitely understand the praise this movie got, because it tackles the topic brilliantly without lacking in great writing. Clint Eastwood just knows how to make movies! The cast is excellent, Hillary Swank in the main role delivers supported by the powerful duo of Morgan Freeman and the legend himself Clint Eastwood.

However it is not one of the greatest movies of all time! It is a very good movie, especially if you like boxing movies.

29 March 2011,"A very depressing, yet fresh punch of filmmaking.","Clint Eastwood remains and is still known as a legendary person. He's acted in terrific films like 'Unforgiven' and 'The Good, Bad, and Ugly', as well as directed 'Mystic River' and 'Unforgiven'. You CANNOT despise him of his works, because they are all fresh pieces of art. I had high expectations for this film and it succeeded thoroughly, but in a very grief way.

'Million Dollar Baby' is a fresh punch in the face with a total knockout. It features outstanding performances; as well as a trustworthy script. Unfortunately, it falls under a film I won't see again, because of the depressing atmosphere...

Acting is basically the category that really makes this film. Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman give staggering performances with lots of characterization. Eastwood is a true genius; he plays 'Frankie' with aggressiveness, courage, and confidence. What a show! Swank is almost better than him; shady, determined; and achieved. Freeman is probably the best; a great narrator, showcased, and calm.

The script is 'second-best'. Joining forces with the incredible acting; it really works. Again, lots of credit towards Eastwood.

Depression though cannot be under defined. The film is thoroughly grief-full and a bit of a set back. Basically, tearful and the only thing I didn't like about this film.

Overall, if you are a movie-goer, go see it right now; you won't be disappointed. Though, be WARNED; its depressing and will make you cry. Clint Eastwood really is even more achieving with this film...",9
30 June 2015,Much more than just a boxing movie!!!Excellent acting!!!!,"Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film directed, co- produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, and starring Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a veteran Los Angeles boxing trainer who keeps almost everyone at arm's length, except his old friend and associate Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). When Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives in Frankie's gym seeking his expertise, he is reluctant to train the young woman, a transplant from working-class Missouri. Eventually, he relents, and the two form a close bond that will irrevocably change them both.

17 September 2005,One a Million - No make that a trillion.,"This is the best film this side of the year 2000. It is a moving tribute to Clint Eastwood's superior film making abilities and a film that has made an everlasting mark on the film industry. This film sports a beautiful cast of wonderful characters who are genuinely cared for by the audience, and the performances by Hilary Swank (who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role), Clint Eastwood (who shoulda won the Best Actor Oscar, but had to settle for the Best Direction and Picture Oscars instead), and Morgan Freeman (who procured the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are fantastic, to say the least. So we know it is an Oscar winner, but so what? Well I'll tell you so what. This film is not only deserving of these awards but more praise and recognition than any other film made after the year 2000, and that goes for Gladiator, Training Day, Adaptation and even Clint's earlier film, Mystic River. Not only do the performances gleam, but the story is brilliant, moving and even based on true events. The moods created by Clint's unique direction and the superb acting talents of these main actors, is incomparable to any of the aforementioned films, and the style is not only beautiful but often mesmerising. You want to jump with glee as you see Clint and his boxing prodigy Hilary Swank aspire to great success, but you also feel the horrible snapping of your own nerves as you watch what becomes of them when Hilary's character Margaret Fitzgerald, is left paralysed after a fight. The film will definitely have some in tears, as I had to control the urge to let go and sob my eyes out myself, which I find is hard for a film to do. It is compelling to watch and the overall experience has helped me understand why my most respected director Martin Scorsese missed out on his Oscar. The truth is that Clint out-directed him and made a film that was a lot better to watch, and I think that if there is only one film worth watching this side of the millennium, it has to be Million Dollar Baby.",9
13 February 2005,"*sniff* Dammit, Clint Made Me Cry!","MILLION DOLLAR BABY (4 outta 5 stars) Clint's movies seem to be getting sadder and sadder as he gets older... not his trademark good-guy-gets-the-bad-guy stuff... but realistic, human stories of heavy emotion. ""Unforgiven"", ""White Hunter, Black Heart"", ""Mystic River"" and now, his latest, ""Million Dollar Baby"". I was leery of the premise of this from the start... Clint playing a crusty old curmudgeon of a boxing coach who takes on a spunky young gal (Hilary Swank) against his ""better"" (i.e. male chauvinist) judgment. Well, of course, the young spunky gal proves herself and they go on together to fight a championship bout... but then things take a darker turn. A very powerful movie... with great performances by Eastwood, Swank and, as usual, Morgan Freeman. Some of the other performances are a little off-putting. The redneck parents of Swank's character are played a little too broad (especially the clichéd ex-con husband covered in tattoos). The slow-witted kid who hangs around the gym serves no purpose. And the priest that Eastwood talks to after mass every day... well, he's kind of a jerk, isn't he? He started out as an interesting character... but when called upon for compassion or insight towards the end he doesn't seem to have much to offer. Oh well, minor flaws... but a little tweaking here and there could have made this a truly Oscar-worthy pic. As it stands, I still think ""The Aviator"" ranks a tad higher.",8
5 March 2023,Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!,"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby.""

My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.

In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.

While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort.",8
5 June 2020,"For everyone, love is another dream","I always like to watch such films, because I feel a little warm. In such a world, the short and weak life of mankind always carries too many pursuits and dreams. Busy, stumbled, stolen and secret, and so exhausted that he even forgot-- For everyone, love is another dream.

26 March 2008,"Dreams, Hopes and Loss, Million Dollar Baby is a sure winner","Million Dollar Baby was watched by myself and my mum just last night. Between us we knew nothing of boxing or the world that lived within its grasp, so we were anxious of the outcome of a boxing movie that had fantastic reviews. But Clint Eastwood didn't let us down. Million Dollar proved an insightful, honest and beautifully captured picture. With top-notch performances all round especially from Hillary Swank getting Best Lead Female Role in a film at the Oscars and Best Supporting Male Actor from Morgan Freeman also at the Oscars. The point is don't be discouraged from watching this film from your lack of boxing knowledge, this film perhaps from a point of view like myself is critical of the sport saying how barbaric and inhuman hitting each other is. Million Dollar Baby is a sure winner for all.

1 April 2005,Not the best picture of the year but still pretty good,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",8

22 March 2005,Million Dollar Baby - Million Dollar Experience,"Heavy. Not in a ponderous way. More like overwhelming. While the movie has many parts that are light hearted and pleasant, the confluence of its undercurrents and themes towards the end seems almost too much to grasp. It left me deep in thought, struggling to deciminate this striking portrayal of human relationships. Acting was superb. The plot moved. I cared about the characters. Violence was sometimes difficult to watch but meaningful. Only criticism I had was some of the scenes could have used a little more lighting (too film noirish) and at times I had problems following the dialogue. One of my co-workers said this movie was not about boxing. I tend to disagree. It was about boxing, but was also about life, love, caring, redemption and dedication. Tough at times to watch, it was tough to forget. If you want ""Singing in the Rain"" or other family fare, this isn't the picture. If you want to feel emotions, whether they be happy, sad, or anywhere in between, if you want to care about the characters you watch and think about them later, put this one on the list.

6 August 2005,"Great acting, powerful story but ""What did he say?""","Acting: Overall, the acting is superb. Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swanks were brilliant, and Clint was good but not great. How difficult is it to play a crusty old man that grouches at everyone? Clint's acting could have been a bit more nuanced at those times in the story when he is supposed to feel sad or uncertain or frustrated. Most supporting characters were also tremendous - totally convincing and they did a lot with their characters. A priest and a family lawyer were the two characters that did not work for me.

Cinematography was good with an effective gritty realism to the first 70% of the movie. There were some some noticeable lapses in story-telling and continuity.

Worst problem with the film was the sound. Much of the narration and dialog early in the movie were hard to make out, Morgan Freeman is occasionally unintelligible. And in a climatic scene, Clint Eastwood chooses to deliver the most memorable line in the movie in a whisper that left my wife and I asking ""what did he say? What did you hear?""",9
1 March 2022,Depressing,"This is a heart-wrenching drama from the Master of Psychology, Clint Eastwood. Here, we see that his directing skills are as great as his acting skills. The movie moves slowly at a regular pace with no intention to hurry. Every character is studied delicately until the viewer identifies with them. But this is not all. He also composed the gloomy background music that accompany dark depressing scenes. Top-class photography is also worthy of mention.

20 December 2019,You'll either love it or hate it.,"I loved it. The only problem I found was the pace of the movie. It's sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow. The boxing matches are very short. It's not the usual matches we've seen. And there isn't much of training either. Clint Eastwood looks and acts the same in both of his movies(Gran Turismo) I've seen. Anyway, watch it and decide for yourself.

9 May 2020,Great Film,"My Clint Eastwood appreciation goes on and on.

One thing I remember from this movie was the stool on the corner of the ring. This is such a deep, emotional, and toughing story. It fits the mold of the cast who played each character.

The filmmaking complements the theme as well. And for that reason it's an all around great film. But I can't give it above the 7 star line because certain things didn't check off for me and it was on the slower side.

So, for my preference and observance in movies I give it a 6 star rating. Even if I put my interest aside, I would give it a 6.5 at most.

Still.....great work cast and crew.",6
30 May 2022,Could not have been better,"The three characters around which this drama revolves are perfectly drawn by both script and actors, allowing their sparky relationships to come alive with barely a foot put wrong. In consequence the emotional heft of this drama is considerable.

It's hard to see how it could have been better.

3 February 2005,Excellent movie,"Clint Eastwood just keeps getting better. There is a definite sense of realism to the part he plays. Hilary Swank is awesome, she too makes you feel her character. I don't normally comment much on movies or music, but this movie touched me in such a way that I sought this site out so that I could post a comment. There are some things that are left somewhat hanging, but in a sense that you feel OK coming to your own conclusions. I can't wait for this to come out on DVD so that I can buy it and watch it in the comfort of my own home so that I can let my emotions and mouth run amok ;) Excellent movie that reached down and grabbed a hold and shook the roots of my soul and tugged on my heartstrings.

6 December 2005,Review of Million Dollar Baby,"We ordered this movie last night on PPV, and I didn't know anything about it except that it involved boxing and starred Clint Eastwood. While watching the last Oscar Awards, I saw Hillary Swank's acceptance speech and thought it was a bit over the top with emotion. Now I understand why, and I also understand why it's so important to see the nominated films before the awards! I have never seen Ms. Swank in any other movie, but as of today I am a die-hard fan. What a gut-wrenching, heartfelt, sincere performance she gave us! Not to mention her efforts put forth to recreate the physical and conditioning demands of such a role.

As for Clint Eastwood, his character holds immense content to create such a beautiful film. He is an inspiration to those of us who may be feeling less 'able' as we age. Although the narrative role of Morgan Freeman's character made me hearken back to 'The Shawshank Redemption', I did not mind the similarity. Like Shawshank, I found great comfort in hearing his voice. It provided some sort of calming reassurance through all the swirling emotions I felt as I watched this film.

I urge everyone who loves films to see this one and to tell everyone you know to see it as well.",9

4 April 2005,A girl boxer defies her own odds with unsuccessful success,"I did like C Eastwood so much in my youth, one of these people like Borris Beker who was not supposed to be cut for ""it"" (no other comparison intended). But I had difficulty to keep the same enthusiasm with his aging and film direction. When he finally got an award for ""unforgiven"" I felt uncomfortable with it The movie did not do much for me and made me wonder if there were other reasons for the award. IE ""May be we ought to"" Million dollar baby I saw a week ago restored my appeal with C. Eastwood and my only real criticism would be the voice volume being too low, my hearing is not the best and I missed a lot of dialog so could not join with the appreciative reaction from the rest of the audience during the film session. Here I saw a new C Eastwood who had aged gracefully and gave us a touching story MB

20 January 2006,Rare glimpse into the goodness of mankind,"I can tell you that seeing the goodness of mankind in a movie these days is so rare. In this movie, you see raw passion that is not driven by revenge or anger. The characters are so believable and real - you feel like you want to know more and more. The story was simple, but the emotional tones were complex and interesting. Clint Eastwood has a unique talent in showing an audience kindness and sincerity in a person's character without making them look or appear meek or mild. I took away a refreshed hope and relished in the wholesome quality of his artistry. So many people heralded this movie as a ""best yet"" or ""movie of the year"", but it surpasses these statements as a BEST EVER. I am so thankful Eastwood took a rather unattractive story line (woman boxer) and made it a legend!

22 March 2005,"pretty good, not great","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

17 February 2006,Clint Eastwood-excellent Actor/Director,"I admire Clint Eastwood a lot and think he is a genius film director comparable to John Huston and John Ford proving again and again that he is capable of handling any subject and giving it a fine finish. The talent of Clint is not limited to film direction only but he has excelled in acting as well. His forceful acting and direction has given us many good films: Fistful of Dollars, Good bad & ugly, Where eagles dare, Paint your wagon, Breezy, Play misty for me, Outlaw Josey Wales, The gauntlet, Beguiled, Pale rider, The unforgiven, Bridges of Madison, Midnight in the garden of good and evil and now Million dollar baby-the list is very impressive. Well done Clint but we want more films of high standard from you as we can't accept less than that. So please continue producing and directing and for that we wish you a long and healthy life.

20 January 2005,Absolutely essential - Eastwood has done it!,"OK, I will admit from the outset that i like Clint Eastwood. I like his style, both his acting and directing style. I like the look of him, and whats more i think that he lends a certain gravitas to any movie he's involved with (whether he be on or off screen). However i will also say that although i found both 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River' to be satisfying movies on the whole, they each suffered problems which kept them from being all they could.

I'm happy to say that with 'Million Dollar Baby' Eastwood has finally done it. His direction is as precise and exact as one could want, and with a unbelievable sense of balance he still manages to create a truly intimate and obviously personal picture. For me it is balance that is the key to why 'MDB' outdoes his previous efforts and elevates itself to the practically flawless. The emotion and atmosphere is never over the top (and if anything is slightly restrained) this maintains a hard-to-watch realism which demands your attention, draws you in and keeps you involved throughout.

The real star of this picture is the beautiful Hilary Swank. As Maggie Fitzgerald she has done something many (including myself) thought impossible and surpassed her Oscar winning performance from 'Boy's Don't Cry'. With this mature, subtle and thoroughly expert turn she has proved that she is one of the most promising and talented actresses in the world today.

Swank becomes the character. Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. In this picture, Swank doesn't steal scenes, She owns them. She holds her own and more, even when sharing the screen with Freeman or Eastwood.

This is a perfect example of classic direction, real emotion and fantastic acting from all involved. Swank deserves Best Actress without a doubt and likewise the Best Director should go to Eastwood.

9 July 2006,"A little melodrama, but still as good.","Heard so much in regards to this Oscar-winning movie and it's amazing how generally I had read over here over the comments. It proved why this won the Best Picture Oscar last year.

Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a waitress who wants to be a boxer and met Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and asked him to be her trainer. Narrated from the point-of-view of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), it tells how Maggie is so determined to be a boxer that even Frankie has no choice but to coach her.

The narration somehow added a little 'darkness' into the movie and that is almost like the general feeling of the movie. It may look a little draggy for some, but then looking at how Maggie is so determined to make her mark and not just being a waitress for her entire life, at times we really need to ask ourselves about our purpose of life. Sounds a little cliché, but always worth considering about.

It's a little dark at times, but the plot is enough to make us ask about so many things in life.

Hilary Swank is so into her role as the determined female boxer Maggie that it's hard at times to remember that she is just portraying Maggie. Clint Eastwood as the trainer Frankie, quite good. Morgan Freeman being the narrator, not bad.",8

11 October 2005,"A bit overrated, still the genius of the actors made it good enough to call it great.","I've now seen two recent boxing films in two days. And I'm astonished (and glad too) to find out how much ""Million Dollar Baby"" differs from ""Cinderella Man"". The latter one is a highly passionate presentation of a heroic, though predictable, true story. Million Dollar Baby is not stylish or passionate, its simplicity in direction or cinematography is a necessary marker of the harsh reality it depicts, unlike the fairy-tale truth of Cinderella Man. One can easily divide the film in two parts, and the first one is truly about boxing.

Cinderella Man is primarily a story of a man's struggle through life, only his profession is boxing. But the first part of MDB is about boxing and its technical details. In this case, according to the opinions of the viewers who know about boxing, Eastwood made some serious mistakes (some of them are listed in the 'Goofs' section). But the last half of the film shows us that boxing and technical details are not the point of this film too. How Eastwood and the screenwriters bring about the shocking plot twist and the brilliant ending is truly the best part of the film.

Now speaking of the actors, what can I say, it is one of the few films where all of the main cast members are at their best. I'm sure soon Hilary Swank will be type-casted in such roles, she's so good at them. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's cold chemistry with Frankie Dunn is quite enjoyable. For Eastwood, I don't know what to say, but I'm sure there are few performances that supply constant inspiration to all the people involved with cinema industry, it's one of them.

But as a director, Eastwood falters from his last year classic standard of ""Mystic River"". Maybe because as I've said earlier that this film is about harsh reality, not passion or style, Eastwood's direction is surprisingly bland, without any moment to praise whole-heartedly. Especially the boxing matches are utterly below average display. It's funny he got the Academy Award for direction, not acting.",8
17 May 2021,One of the... Three?!? Smart sports films.,"'Million Dollar Baby' is highly emotional and intelligent. It uses subtle, hugely original personalised metaphors to incredible effect. These metaphors are incorporated whilst, more blatantly, larger societal issues are explored.

My first taste of Eastwood direction - Knockout.

16 March 2005,"Overrated and over hyped, typical of Hollywood","I heard so much hype about this movie with the Oscar and all I decided to see it against my better judgment about Hollywood's history of awarding bad movies top awards. Unfortunately, the movie, while entertaining and fairly acted, failed to impress me, not to mention live up to its hype. I continue to be puzzled by Hollywood's award giving standards.

The story is very typical and too simple. Hilary Swank is a highly motivated woman from a very trashy family with a very unlikely dream of becoming a female boxing champion. She seeks the help of a very skeptical trainer Frankie (Eastwood) who eventually believes in her and trains her. Of course she did not disappoint him and quickly rose to the top (way too quickly) to face the evil German boxer. They unnecessarily over demonized Swank's family and the German boxer, a cheap way to glorify and gain sympathy for the main characters. I never understood why Swank's character has such an unrealistic passion for boxing (very rare for a woman). The movie never really explored her motive other than the fact that her family was quite mean. The movie, while well directed, never developed into a true boxing story. It was like they were trying to remake Rocky, the female version of it, but failed to bring the realism and emotions of Rocky. I never really understood the point behind that movie. May be someone or some people are attempting to promote female boxing. Swank is a fine actress and she did a good job portraying a boxer despite her soft and feminine quality. Eastwood did not fit the part of a boxing trainer who is a loner with an odd relationship with Freeman that included a mixture of guilt and regrets. He was acting more like a cop than a true boxing trainer. Freeman's character, a very wise and calm washed out boxer, was typical of every Freeman role I've seen. I think his in good company with Eastwood, they both lack acting versatility. They are only good for one role. The movie never really took off and it almost ended as it started, except with fewer characters.",6

15 May 2006,Exceptional!!!!!,"I love to talk about the latest films with my co-workers and Million Dollar Baby was no exception. As I was talking about the film, it seems that there were a lot of people that went into this movie looking for the female boxer-version of Rocky. However disappointed they might have been with this misconception, most were not disappointed with the movie as whole. What an emotional roller coaster! Clint Eastwood has definitely fashioned a masterpiece! And finally Morgan Freeman was rewarded for his career of exceptional work!It's about time. The camera work and use of light and dark is second to none. Loved it. Two thumbs way up!

8 April 2006,"Strong, believable and emotional!","Plot: Maggie (Swank) is an ambitious woman who walks through boxing trainer Frankie's (Eastwood) door with nothing but guts and her wish of becoming a pro boxer, but she is too old in in his opinion. Oh, and the fact that she's a girl doesn't make it easier for her to be accepted. Frankie doesn't like to lose and is convinced he will with a girl boxer. Frankie finds himself being persuaded by Maggie and former boxer Eddie (Freemind) and at last gives in. Then starts the hard work, but Maggie is eager to learn. As other reviewers have mentioned; there are some subplots, but it's more fun if you're not aware of them before after you've actually seen the movie. And you should see the movie. There is a lot more that happens, but you need to see it for yourself.

It took a while getting used to Swank playing anyone else than Brandon (Boys Don't Cry), but it didn't take long before I realized what a great actress she is to be able to make the character her own. Swank, Freemind and Eastwood make a great team and that is probably why Eastwood has not included a broader cast when directing.

This is quality!",10

4 June 2006,An inside look to a well read story!,"This film is made ever so much better by the fact that; for the most part, it is narrated by the attractively engrossing bitter truth that Morgan Freeman brings to everything he reads aloud. If you've seen the film 'The Shawshank Redemption', and enjoyed the narration within, you'll once again find the same comforting friend tell you another story.

Hilary Swank, (as Maggie Fitzgerald), gives the performance of her career, as a woman not quite middle aged, but not exactly young either, chasing a dream of her youth that she just can't let go of. Clint Eastwood's, (Frankie Dunn), portrayal of a burnt-out & cantankerous boxer/trainer character, is so believable, it makes you feel as if you'd be anxious to try to please him, were you in Maggie Fitzgerald's,(Hilary Swank), place. How she plays into that interaction is the key to the tenderly complicated relationship that Maggie & Frankie develop. Morgan Freeman, (Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris), plays the character that ties everything together & bears witness to it all. His elocution of the facts are the base of the narration given throughout.

Needless to say, the cast is exquisite, and the collision of fates within the story is inspiring. Definitely a must see!!!",10

It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9
26 February 2009,This film will endure,"Every time I see this I get something new out of it. Before a film can be judged as great or classic it has to endure the test of time. Will people still watch it 10 or 20 years later , or better yet 50 or 60 years later. MDB is very unique with a plot that goes one way, veers a little about a third through, and then about two thirds goes off in a totally unexpected direction with fabulous results. It reminds me of Psycho in that way. Very brave and extremely unique. I can't think of any other film that does this. I believe this film will rise in popularity whereas Gran Torino(which I also love) will decline. I would love to glance 50 years in the future and see where this film stands. I bet it would be among the all-time greats.

15 November 2005,A Million Dollars Worth Of Disappointment,"Eastwood is revealed yet again as a mediocre director, who is not capable of making a decent film from a script that clearly needed some viagra injected into it.

Looking back at my viewing experience, I mainly feel disgust. Disgust at having someone pressing my tear glands so unceremoniously.

What Million Dollar Baby fails most miserably at is creating a believable interaction between it's main characters. As all the actors for the main parts have shown they're capable of better, we must blame the director. Especially sad is Eastwood's own performance. Usually very dependable, Eastwood is so weak in this film, it's almost irritating to watch him. Swank and Freeman manage to make the most of their weak roles but to call their appearances ""noteworthy"" would be an exaggeration.

Of course the real baddie in this drama is the story itself, which is chuck-full of crudely-drawn clichés, caricatures and plain stupidity. Even a B-movie deserves better than this drivel.

Eastwood is badly in need of material for a rehabilitation after this latest performance.

By the way, putting this movie on a par with Raging Bull is both ridiculous and an insult to Martin Scorcese. Even Clint himself would be appalled.",4
9 February 2017,People that love this movie are sick. Why people like to watch cruel movies?,"Let's make a movie about torturing kitties and puppies... apparently people love cruel movies so it should be a success. Right?

Well, this movie is not about torturing kitties and puppies but you get the idea of how bad this movie is in those terms. I really don't get it.

I loved the first half of the movie, but after that it all goes down.

I like the performance of all actors, the director was good, music was good, all was good, but the story turns 180° and I hate it after that.

If you think this is like rocky but with a woman instead of a men, you are wrong. I enjoy all Rocky movies, but this movie takes some of rocky ideas and put a twist you could only desire to your worst enemy.

So they make you care about the main character and then play with that in a cruel way.",1
27 September 2012,A little to slow to be a 10,"This was a pretty good girl boxer movie, but for me the slow monotonous pace just didn't quite make it as good as all the awards it won. The story is solid, a girl boxer, broke and living in poverty seeks her dreams of becoming a big-time female boxer. She seeks out a down and out trainer and begs her way into his heart, and ends up...well you have to see for yourself.

I give it an 8, because yes, it was a pull on your heart strings, make all the ladies cry type story. The acting was very good, and everyone seems to love Morgan Freeman no matter what he does.

Clint Eastwood directs and plays the hardened, down and out trainer, which is not far from the character he always plays.

The only real problem I had watching this movie is that the pace of it was awful. Unless you live in a nursing home, you may fall asleep before you even reach the mid way point. Then again, awards and raves always seem to come easy for movies that are the equivalent of prescription sleep medication starring actors that draw people into the theaters by reputation alone.

For me, it is a very good story with some great acting and worth watching but I cannot say that it was worth all the critical raves, glowing banter, and sheer brilliance that was heaved on to it.

Like my reviews? Hate em? Have a DVD that you want reviewed? Shoot me an e-mail at subliminal.lithium@gmail.com",8
12 October 2006,Tremedous,"I steered clear after this movie even when it won best picture. I suppose I wasn't interested in watching a film about female boxer just as Eastwood's character wasn't interested in training one. That said, I finally watched it. The movie is simply captivating. Each character is equally interesting. Watching Freeman and Eastwood interact is brilliant. The story itself is about a desperate, white trash, waitress, (Swank) who dedicates her life to a sport that doesn't necessarily want her. Eastwood is a jaded boxing coach with a deep past. And Freeman plays a long retired boxer who was never able to make good with his big chance. It's a dark film, and the cinematography is appropriate to that. The only issue I had is that the antagonists are simply too easy to hate. They are not complicated enough. However, considering everything else in is to its advantage i rate this one 10/10.

16 January 2005,Wonderful Film,"A brilliant, thoughtful film from Clint Eastwood. The 3 main performances are very realistic and excellent and the acting is deliberately and delightfully underplayed. The theme of a women boxer may seem trite to UK audiences but stick with it - it's worth it.

Eastwood has a role befitting his age and his trademark minimalist style. Freeman's acting , as a seen-it-all ex-pro boxer, is sublime. But it's Swank who catches the eye in a role that she was made for.

Its a typical Eastwood film - slowish with artful camera angles and empty spaces. The central setting is a run-down gym and this is beautifully realised. Also typically for Eastwood , the film has more plot than one would imagine from the first hour-or-so of set-up.

28 August 2005,Uninspired,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

28 January 2005,"Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and I'll show you a man who's waiting for a beatin'.","Masterpiece. Engrossing. Heartbreaking. All words that describe a Johnny Betts movie review. But they can also be used to describe Clint Eastwood's latest project - Million Dollar Baby. Make no mistake about it; I'm a huge Eastwood mark. So you might be inclined to believe that since I'm a fan, I'm just gonna praise whatever he does. That's not entirely true though. The man has an Oscar resting comfortably upon his shelf, so he certainly doesn't need my validation.

Clint is no stranger to critical success, but for my money Million Dollar Baby is a better movie than his other two most heralded movies - Unforgiven (which I felt was overrated and one of Clint's weaker Westerns) and Mystic River, Clint's Oscar-hyped wristslitter of 2003. They all have their merits, but Million Dollar Baby has a fascinating combination of deliberate, gripping storytelling, great acting, sparse but well-placed music, engaging drama, and subtle humor that the others don't have. Oh, and the boxing in the movie is very realistic, nothing fancy or over-the-top.

Speaking of boxing, the word alone is enough to turn off some viewers. One of the first responses I get whenever I start explaining the plot to this movie is, ""Oh, I don't like boxing movies, so I probably won't like it."" One thing you need to understand is that this is not a boxing movie. It's a movie about human relationships that just happens to use boxing as its backdrop.

There's the relationship between Frankie and Scrap. Frankie worked as a cut man for Scrap many years ago, and twenty-three years later, Frankie still feels responsible for Scrap losing sight in his right eye after a particularly brutal fight. But their friendship has remained strong. Clint and Freeman display such a great chemistry that you actually feel like they've been friends for over twenty years. Well, I did at least. They sound like an old married couple at times, arguing over silly things like the holes in Scrap's socks or Frankie's less-than-jovial demeanor. The dialogue is funny and crisp without being overly eloquent. Exactly what you'd expect from a couple of guys who've been around boxing their whole lives.

Then there's the father/daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie. Frankie has no relationship with his actual daughter - as evidenced by the fact that the letters he sends her every week always return un-opened and marked ""Return to sender."" We never really find out why his daughter hates him so much, but I assume his involvement in the boxing business kept him from being around her, and she hasn't forgiven him. Maggie's dad died when she was young, but Frankie reminds her a lot of him. Once he starts to train her, Frankie is really the only person she can depend on, and they form a strong bond that both were previously missing in their lives.

Hilary Swank, as Maggie, is impressive enough to finally make us all forget about The Core. I didn't expect to like her character very much, so I walked away pleasantly surprised. Her southern accent just sounded too fake in the trailers, but I got used to it, and I was shocked to find myself caring about Maggie. Note to Hilary: KEEP YOUR HAIR LONG! I like the movie's straight-forward message about how sometimes in life, having the heart and desire to do something isn't always enough. It's like Frankie says, ""Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and I'll show you a man who's waiting for a beatin'."" It's not a lesson a lot of people want to hear, but it's just the kick in the pants that a lot of people need.

I wasn't as pleased, however, with the movie's ending. And this is something that might cause a lot of people to be really upset. I can't say much because I'd give too much away, but I can say that a couple of characters make some decisions I don't condone. But it's done in a way not to be preachy. A character is even advised against taking a certain course of action, and then the audience is left to see what choice is made.

In a recent interview, Clint was asked about the controversial ending, and he replied, ""I'm just telling a story. I don't advocate. I'm playing a part. I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do."" That's honestly the best way to look at it.

Is the ending depressing? Sure. Do I have my own ideas of how the movie could've ended on a better note? Yep. But that's life. Reality isn't always pretty, and this movie does a good job of capturing that realism, regardless of whether we agree with certain decisions or not. You can choose to put a situation in God's hands, or you can attempt to solve it on your own. You just have to be willing to accept the consequences of your decision.

THE GIST

Million Dollar Baby is simple at its core - a movie that uses great performances to do a great job of storytelling. If you're a fan of anybody in the cast and you can handle something with a less-than-cheerful ending, then Million Dollar Baby will keep your interest. Just make sure you bring some Kleenex. But if you prefer to walk out of a movie whistling and tapping your feet, then I suggest looking elsewhere.

Oh, and guys, if you happen to notice a salty liquid substance forming around the rims of your eyes, then don't worry too much. It's like the Memphis Tigers football coach (Tommy West) says, ""Men don't cry, their eyes sweat."" Keep that excuse handy, and you'll be fine.",
13 March 2005,Hilary Swank is an acting goddess,"First, I would like to say that every actor hopes to land a role of a lifetime. This is that one role for Hilary Swank. I know that we will see her for years to come in other roles but this could be the role that defines her career. She deserves it. She is the most gracious person to walk the red carpet at the Academy Awards. I don't know if anyone caught it but when she was interviewed on the red carpet, she thanked her 5th grade teacher for giving her the chance to do a skit in front of the class. She even said his name. She is one classy individual! She really conditioned hard for this role. She is ripped in the gym! She really looks like a boxer. It's a gritty performance. That is what makes it such a pleasure to watch. She is not afraid to take on the roles that do not show off her beauty. She is gorgeous but she chooses not to take the fluffy, cutesy romantic leads that too many others get sucked into doing for the big money. That is why I applaud her. She will be remembered as a great actor.

Morgan Freeman is also exceptional. He is such a good actor. He does it so effortlessly. He said in an interview that Eastwood doesn't like to do a lot of takes. Freeman said that is okay with him but you better come to the scene prepared to deliver. Eastwood likes to use an economy of scale method in order to stay within budget. He's very professional and likes to work with others that hold the highest standards of excellence as well.

I like films that have conflict and good character development. This movie has both. It is a touching relationship between Clint Eastwood's character and Hilary's. It develops so expertly. You really have to hand it to Eastwood. He has reached a level of directing others in his class envy. He is doing some of his best work in his later years when most actors his age walk off into the sunset.

He's an actor's director. Although it is a formula film, the characters are so strong and compelling, you just can't help but care about them. This film made me misty eyed. Any film that can evoke emotions from its audience such as this is definitely worth the price of admission. Don't forget to bring the Kleenex.",
28 July 2007,Best movie in a long time!,"This movie is a masterpiece. It deserves, in my point of view, to be higher up in the ""top 250"" list. I was flying from England to America and it was on the plane, I was 10 and unfortunately, Madagascar beat out this film. About a month ago my dad added this DVD to are vast collection, thinking that none of us would watch it. My dad had seen it before and said it was amazing, he also told me it was true, for some reason. So I sat down and watched it when I had conjunctivitis and stayed off school. I was bawling my eyes out for half the movie, I'm 13 so its not that big a deal, but my dad cried too, which was weird. One of the best films ever made with three of the best actors/actresses. Watch it!

It shows you how Maggie can take hits emotionally and physically but all that with the help of his coach that she insisted to have, but gladly was able t have, Overall a really great movie and highly suggest this movie if you like action/ sport movies.

24 August 2008,This is just Hollywood sentimental rubbish.,"Million Dollar Baby does not solve any questions it presents. I can't believe it's in the top 250.

OK, where shall I begin? Well, for a start, it was incredibly predictable. Clint Eastwood plays one of the most clichéd characters ever. He's a tough man with a heart of gold. John Wayne anyone? Also, Hilary Swank was garbage in it. She was so wooden, and I didn't believe for a second she was a remotely good boxer. I hated it how she got all the good scenes instead of Morgan Freeman who was the only good thing about this film.

Paul Haggis is perhaps the most overrated writer in recent times. He uses such formulaic dialogue, it makes a Tarantino fan like myself vomit feverishly when I hear a line like ""You're all I've got."" There are tons of other examples but I can't remember them because I was so bored.

Also, it tries to do too much. It tries to deal with the father daughter relationship, Rednecks, euthanasia, how you have to take chances, how you shouldn't gamble etc. Never heard those issues being discussed before have we lades and gents? Especially not in one film. I can imagine Haggis at his typewriter thinking ""How can I spread the plague of my crap TV writing to the wider audience? I know, I'll try to make a boxing movie, WITH A DIFFERENCE!! I'll deal with tons of issues to win the critics over."" Sadly Paul, I'm not fooled.

I admit, the cinematography was good in the car scene where the light moves and you can't see their faces and stuff but this light dark thing didn't work for a lot of the film. There were countless scenes where a character stood with their head in darkness. That's not an overused technique is it? And the ending, oh God the ending was abysmal. For those who haven't seen it, let me just let you know it is predictable the second she gets knocked out by a one dimensional East German evildoer. Ahhhhh! I hate characters like that boxer. They don't exist in the real world and how the hell is she world champion? She would get disqualified for breaking the rules obviously. It's such a cop out from the idiot that is Paul Haggis of making poor innocent Hilary, who has just knocked like 20 people out with one punch (realistic huh?), get knocked out by a cheating communist bitch.

If only Pauline Kael was still alive and writing. I am certain she would have shown this film for what it is, sentimental garbage. She is famous for hating unrealistic idealism and that is exactly what this appallingly overrated film is about. R.I.P Pauline, one of the few critics who saw through the sad state of most Hollywood movies.",3

28 January 2005,"Aviator, Schmaviator....Go see what it takes to live life without a trailer, a deep fryer, and some Oreos.","I swore I would not write another review, but here goes. Given my history, I will probably not write one again for another two years (my average). That should be a blessing to anyone reading my previous entries.

I am a sucker for good stories, particularly ones about ordinary people attempting extraordinary things. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of those films, and because Clint Eastwood knows how to cast, how to act, and how to get out of the way of the actors he uses, this film makes for a great story even if you don't like the conclusions ( and for ethical reasons, I didn't).

Anything I say about this film will spoil its impact but suffice it to say, Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood do a great job telling a tale about how people work around their personal limitations to achieve their dreams and how to deal with the options when those dreams fall apart. The boxing business, particularly women's' boxing, is simply the canvas around which such issues are played out. Through this canvas, the characters figure out the meaning of love, loss, separation, and courage in a style that is truly enjoyable and memorable.

I am sure that this picture will not win Best Picture at the Oscars because those cinematic elitists will assume that it is a stylistic mimeograph (now you know how old I AM) of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Morgan Freeman even narrates this film as he did that one. I promise you that this movie is not ""Clone of Shawshank"". Paul Haggis' screenplay is friendly, funny, and for the most part not ad-libbed. There is enough humor and realistic pathos to carry one though 137 minutes without being bored in the process. Hillary Swank puts in an admirable performance as a girl without a dime and with a dream. Eastwood and Freeman interact classically with one another as trainer and former boxer and confidant. Their banter and one-liners are both poignant and funny. Eastwood is also good (though kind of predictable as in previous offerings) as a trainer who has made many mistakes in life for which he seeks redemption and from which he can never fully recover. Freeman is as comfortable as an old shoe as the has-been heavyweight who still holds the heavyweight title in common sense, courage, and character.

I won't say anything more that this. I despised greatly the ending of this film. If you feel the same way I do about some fundamental issues, you will also despise it. That being said, the issues being presented might be one reason why one should SEE this film. It will certainly be a cause for frank discussion with your family, significant other, or friends. It ought to be. If it isn't a source of discussion, then one probably has no soul.

To cut this short, it ain't the Godfather I and II, but it's a damn nice film. One might well forget about this film in a few years (though I did not forget ""The Shawshank Redemption""), but one won't forget the impact it has immediately after one leaves the theater.

Find out what it takes to avoid having to live life with a trailer, a deep fryer, and some Oreos. Go see Million Dollar Baby. On IMDb's scale, it ranks about a 7 with me.",7

30 January 2005,Very exciting and guarantee to make you cry,"I rarely see an Oscar nominated movie, but this motion picture is worth all the hype. The movie starts out like an old-school Rocky movie starting with exciting boxing scenes. I liked this movie for the unhappy ending and I found myself crying even four hours after the movie was over. Clint and Hilary have a great rapport that makes me like the two main characters. Hilary Swank is a great in her character as a boxer and she is very lady like also. I was surprised that Eastwood can still perform like his younger days. The locations were very well chosen and the cast was well chosen. It is very sad, but it is an excellent script and great direction by Clint. I loved it and I hope it wins some of those gold little statues.

31 December 2004,i don't get the fuss,"I went to see Million Dollar Baby with every expectation of being entertained, maybe even exhilarated by the end-of-year accolades for what, in Toronto, was essentially unheralded and unhyped. Well, I tried. And after half the film I was distracted by the many plaudits it has earned, the number of #1 ratings it has accumulated from critics everywhere. I found the movie formulaic in the extreme, predictable at every turn, written with the sophistication of a middling junior high school student and portentous when it wasn't pretentious. We won't begin to discuss Mr. Eastwood's score. Clichés tumble over each other and the narrative device, better by little than phone conversations that tie up creaky plots, made me squirrelly. And all the earnest acting, barely audible grunts and endless fadeout shots made for another ersatz experience in Hollywood. Is the American scene so desperate for an auteur, someone they can claim has the rights to immortality, that they leap over themselves to find a winner? Sideways makes this movie look like kid's play. A Very Long Engagement is head and shoulders above this corny and Oscar-focused pulp film. And sure, it will win plenty of awards, much money will be made from the fraudulent effort to tell a story that we could have done ourselves. So, what's all the fuss about?",
30 December 2007,Just wonderful,"For me ""Milion Dollar Baby"" is one of the best movies made in Hollywood. First of all, it contains a superb cast full of top-actors like Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and then Clint Eastwood is the director of the movie. I think that all Clint Eastwood movies are just great and he has a certain feeling how to let the audience take part at the movie in such an intensive and emotional way. With his wonderful soundtrack which he composed for this masterpiece, every moment becomes valuable and does not make the movie kitschy like many Hollywood movies.

I give ten points, because for me there is nothing which is criticizable and i can watch the movie over and over again and it always feels like the first time watching it.

11 May 2005,Best Boxing Movie I've Ever Seen,"This is seriously, the best boxing movie I've ever seen. What a great story of hope and redemption. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank are excellent....It is completely understandable why this movie won the Oscar for best direction and Hilary Swank won for best leading actress. It was completely deserved. Clint Eastwood continues to please Hollywood and movie lovers around the world. I hope he continues his trend with more excellent movies such as this and Mystic River......BRAVO! I think the major key is in the script writing/production/set direction and the talented actors that are utilized to insure a great performance. Clint Eastwood has done this with Mystic River and, now, Million Dollar Baby. Here's to more excellent films...

21 March 2005,Mental disasters,"Despite the fact that the movie makes friends of the main 3 characters, too many drama's on top of each other lead to some disconnecting feelings. Next to this I asked myself afterward why people (like me?) visit a movie which shows this big of a portion of human bad luck. And yes the movies gives some food for thinking but most of the time in a black and white simplistic way. Still I got hooked by the atmosphere,characters and (sometimes predictable)development of the story. Especially interesting for those fond of tearjerkers and fans of Clint, Morgan and Hilary. Three totally different character create sympathy in their own original ways. Great acting! Last: make sure you'll see the movie but choose the right momentum being sure the movie won't spoil your mood for the rest of the day.

3 June 2006,I don't see what the big deal was.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

21 January 2020,"The art of boxing, the art of cinema","I liked ""Million Dollar Baby"" a lot, it has a great story that takes its time to develop but it rewards you at the end. The cast was fantastic, in particular I loved Morgan Freeman's performance in this one, and the direction by Eastwood was solid as well. Another aspect I liked was that in the end the movie shows a particular situation that is very delicate and a source of dialogues on moral and ethical principles. I don't think it's explored profoundly but it's there and induces the viewer to think about it and to immedesimate with the characters involved. The only thing I didn't like was the score because in my opinion it was uninspired, and the piano jingle that frequently recurs was meh. But other than that great movie, very suggested.

Clarification: IMDB doesn't have the half votes so I had to give it an 8 but it's better, I would give it an 8.5.

27 July 2018,Million Dollar Baby Review,"Million Dollar baby is a film directed by Clint Eastwood. I wanted to watch the film but circumstances didn't allow me to do so. Finally, Last night I decided to watch it and was blown away.

Plot: Follows Frankie Dunn, an old boxing trainer who decides to train an aspiring female boxer, a thing Frankie has never done in life.

Story and direction: The film is just not about boxing (as I thought it would be). It is about the bonding and emotions formed between characters in the film. This is very well crafted by writer, Paul Haggis and director Eastwood. I was actually quite shocked of the themes the film dealt with. I was just fascinated by each and every scene of the film. The dialogue felt so real and struck a lightning bolt in my heart. I could relate to each and every scene in the film. The cinematography in the film is awesome. The boxing scenes were shot in a beautiful way. What added to the intensity of the boxing is the razor sharp editing. In addition to directing and producing the film, Eastwood also scores the film. Although the score is very minimal (which was apt considering the storyline the film was going for) and employs mostly pianos and guitars, it was very effective. My only flaw of the film was the sudden change of tone. It felt the first half was one film and second was another. If the flow would have been even, thw film would have been a notch higher.

Performances: Clint Eastwood is a multi-talented personality. He acts perfectly. The grumpiness and mellowed version of his character was balanced perfectly by him. Hilary Swank was believable in every scene of the film. The hard work gone through by her is visible clearly. Morgan Freeman, who does serve as narrator too, does a wonderful job in supporting our main characters as well as guiding the audience through this emotional and soulful journey.

Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Maggie faces her first match with Sally as her manager and Frankie and Scrap watch from the other side of the hall. Frankie repeatedly tells Maggie to keep her left up. But when Frankie realises that Sally is making the match go his way for his own benefit; Frankie steps up to help Maggie. This scene showed the bond formed between Frankie and Maggie and how much Frankie cared for Maggie even if Frankie wants to hide it.

Verdict: No wonder this film won big at the Academy Awards the subsequent year. Filled with earnest performances and a heart-filling emotional story and set-up, the film is definitely as must watch for those who feel that emotions surpass everything.

I am going with a 9/10.",9
22 August 2022,somewhere between nowhere and good bye.,"This quote is in a whole another level.

Amazing touching emotional.

Nothing less than impressive.

If you have not watched the movie yet what are you waiting for an invitation??!

3 January 2010,Thou shalt not kill,"Watching this I kept thinking 'oh this is really great, Eastwood is great, the girl is excellent,,,.........etc etc' Then suddenly it was if someone pulled the plug on the film and it sunk to an absolute crummy dead end around half an hour before the finish. It's hard these days to watch any Hollywood film without realising you're being propagandised somehow. Some rich and powerful people want the power of life and death over you and they're using the media as a way to bring the subject of euthanasia up in order to familiarise you with the concept that killing is OK under certain circumstances. I've seen loads of articles recently in the news such as 'The case for killing Granny' and others. Sorry, but killing is killing is killing and thou should not kill. End of. So they serve up the 'exception' to the rule ie. in this case it's a merciful thing to do. But as we all know and especially alcoholics know, the exception to the rule can rapidly become the rule. Before you know it they'll be popping you off 'cause your insurance ran out just like they pop off unborn babies for free 'cause you don't want the hassle of looking after one. Hell, life is cheap these days didn't you know? Also they brought the Church in on this one to get the Christians on board too. Nothing Hollywood puts out these days is just innocent entertainment. It all has a political message. They want your mind. And what was the dumb white boy there for? 'Oh we're all fighters and it's the spirit of fighting that counts even if you're really a sorry stupid loser.'= be a loser and let us have control over you. Apart from anything else these subjects do not make good drama. Maybe the key to realising the propaganda part is being pushed is to know when you're feeling bored suddenly. Another intelligence insult. Another one for the recycle bin.",1
21 June 2019,Nice and Good.,"Well, movie's plot is just nice and good and the actress's acting is so good and she herself looked good in this movie. Morgan Freeman is always stunning at any movie. Ending was supposed to be more unique but i think it was something that i was not expecting for sure. Otherwise i found this movie good and ultimate.

30 November 2005,simply overrated - borrowed formula,"I realize that there are a lot of people who like this film, but I for one hated this one. I like Clint and Morgan movies. This one was just too much copy and paste from their roles in other movies. Morgan sounds like he is back at shawshank redemption. Clint plays his traditional tough guy role and Hillary comes across as the tom-boy. There was nothing in this movie that one hasn't seen in other movies from these actors and actress before. The boxing scenes weren't even exciting and the whole story line is not even original. There are scenes that are suppose to be real sad, but all the characters are hard-boiled people who try not to show emotions...and it just didn't come across as a movie that elicits any sympathy. Nothing. Bottomline, full of clichés, nothing new and just Clint's name bringing the Oscar home to an otherwise substance-less movie.

9 June 2016,"Clint is surely one of the greatest directors, actors to make movies","Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, Ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.",7

28 January 2005,Thanks,"While my Mom was significantly older than the Boxer in your movie I had to make the decision to end her life. That moment tortured me for years but I did what I had to do.

What I thought was most interesting about your movie and, I will attach an email that I sent to friends and family, is the rock and the hard place that this government has placed American citizens in as a result of ignorant religious fundamentalism.

I am a religious person but I also believe in ""revelation"" (small R).

Thanks for a brilliant and thought provoking movie.

Peace always,

Bart

Message to Friends Family and and a few Newspapers.

Have you ever been caught between a rock and a hard place? While I am not a movie critic I find myself in that position after seeing Million Dollar Baby. My critic would not be based on the artistic value of the production or indeed the performance of the actors (although both in my opinion were excellent), I am not qualified to do so. My critic has more to do with the position that some folks have regarding the subject matter (and it is not Boxing) and their refusal to allow science to deal with alternatives to the end result of this painful movie.

I would really like to talk more about this but I think the movie stirs a debate and people need to see it. Trust me, I have no financial interest in this movie, but I do have a spiritual connection that I would be more then happy to share after most people see the movie.

26 December 2018,"Hard hitting, emotionally wrenching","I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be.

29 January 2005,"No special effects, no glitz, just raw human emotion","The best movie I have seen in ten years! There's no special effects, hype, glitz or glamour! Just a wonderful movie that highlights the power of dreams and raw human spirit. The nominations it has received are well-deserved! From the opening scenes to the closing credits, I was enthralled. Hilary Swank (the new Julia Roberts?) makes Maggie come alive. From joy to sorrow to struggle, she IS Maggie. Her fighting spirit and determination to achieve a goal are inspiring. Clint Eastwood out did himself on the direction of this film and his portrayal of Frankie. A man who finally opens himself up to another, he will never be the same. Morgan Freeman's (okay, I'm a sucker, I like ANYTHING Morgan Freeman is in!!) role as Eddie (a former boxer) is the kind of guy you want in your corner. Have a great time.....you'll love every minute!

28 December 2022,The second half hits different,"This is not the usual underdog story. I think I was going to watch something like a Rocky or creed but this movie hit me different. Hilary swank was just amazing as maggie. The hunger, the desire to excel and to win can be seen in her eyes. She gets a amazing character arc and she performes it amazingly. Clint Eastwood is amazing as always. I really love him as a director. I think he has done some amazing work when he turned to be a director. Morgan Freeman is just amazing as always. The second part of the movie is reality, it's hard to digest it, but it is what it is. It says something about the human nature. How desire is the driving force of life and when one becomes incapable of persuing his desire, he really loses his will to live. I don't in anyway justify what clint Eastwood's character does, but many humans can't handle the suffering after a limit. I would like to take a good moral from this movie that life is always highs and lows, when one enjoy going through his highs, he must also prepare himself to go through the lows mentally and physically.

It's kind of a depressing movie. But I like to look at the good part and learn from it.",10
23 December 2006,"Worthy ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a Champ","Despite its subject matter, ""Million Dollar Baby"" will bring a million dollar smile to your heart, if only metaphorically. As with the previous year's ""Mystic River,"" a similarly dark though decidedly different film, veteran filmmaker Clint Eastwood reveals his authority with the art of storytelling through the nuanced behavior of his characters. In this, the director's 25th feature film, Eastwood proves there is such a thing as a quality film that can appeal to the masses.

Based on Rope Burns: Tales from the Corner, F.X. Toole's collection of stories about prize fighting, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a throwback to the kind of films that Warner Bros., the studio which financed it, produced in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Eastwood's mastery with the material is such that he has crafted a timeless film, one that will be as much of a treat fifty years from now as it is today. And what a treat it is.

Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the curmudgeonly owner of the Hit Pit, a gritty, money- losing boxing gym in downtown L.A. Once known as the ""best cut man in the business,"" Frankie now spends his days going to church, reading Gaelic poetry, and training Big Willie Little, a fighter whose desire for a shot at the title is hampered only by Frankie's mantra that he'll be ready in ""two or three"" more fights. That Big Willie disagrees becomes not only a point of contention between the two men, but also an early turning point in the plot.

Overseeing the day-to-day needs of the Hit Pit is Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, in one of the best turns of his career), an aging former fighter who lost an eye in his last bout, and whose tendency towards gambling has left him virtually penniless. It is to Freeman's credit and astute understanding of the character, however, that Scrap is never pitiful. On the contrary, the quietly philosophical janitor, who is also Frankie's best friend, is the emotional glue that anchors the film and keeps its center intact. He not only maintains order in the often chaotic, testosterone-laden gym, but also provides advice to Frankie in subtle, ambiguous ways. The moments when these two interact on screen, as in the scene about Scrap's holey socks, provide much of the film's comic relief. They also illuminate into the bond of affection the two share.

Into this unlikely mix comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Academy Award winning Hilary Swank, for ""Boys Don't Cry""), a big-hearted young woman from the wrong side of Missouri's tracks whose only desire is to have Frankie train her. ""I don't train girls,"" Frankie tells her, but Maggie's headstrong ways prevent her from accepting this as a deterrent. Despite Frankie's resistance, Maggie continues to show up at the gym, trains well into the nights she doesn't wait tables near the beach, and begins to improve her skills under Scrap's occasional, secretive training tips.

Frankie's multilayered defense mechanism is no challenge for Maggie's determination. His warning to her that ""tough ain't enough"" only further encourages her. In a scene that lays the foundation for the rest of their relationship, Maggie tells him that boxing is the only thing she ever felt good doing. Frankie relents, with the understanding that the two will part ways as soon as her training is complete and she's ready to enter the ring. But Frankie's own heart, ""so big, he's doomed to take a fall,"" overrides this caveat, and he winds up doing ""something he hated doing."" He takes a chance.

In addition to teaching Maggie the necessary mechanics of the sweet science, Frankie constantly reminds her of the first rule of the fight game: Always protect yourself. But as Scrap's voice-over tells us, people never take their own advice, and Frankie is no exception. As time seamlessly passes during Maggie's career development, Frankie embraces her and her winning spirit in a way he cannot with his own estranged daughter. Such magnanimity can only be rewarded by heartbreak, and from there it's only a matter of time before they careen into the inevitable.

Much has been made over the years of Eastwood's quiet style of working, and the fact that he repeatedly employs the same creative team. One benefit of this practice is the work of the nearly ninety-year-old production designer Henry Bumstead, whose desaturated color palette contributes to the film's somber tone. The conjunction of Bumstead's production design with cinematographer Tom Stern's mostly chiaroscuro lighting creates a spare and haunting look that is rare among modern films, but one that works successfully in this context.

Such a backdrop calls the greatest attention to the actors, and one would be hard- pressed, even during this mad-dash-to-Oscar season, to find any better. Hilary Swank once again proves dauntless when it comes to taking on physically demanding roles without compromising the characters' humanism, but it is Eastwood and Freeman who turn in the kind of nakedly honest performances that suggest a natural understanding of character that comes with age. While one might expect this from these veterans, it is the rare film that provides the opportunity for them to display their skill. That alone makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" a winner.",10

4 March 2005,Best Picture - My thoughts exactly,"I told a friend of mine that I would be very disappointed in the Academy if this film didn't win a number of awards. I agree that Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman were fantastic in the movie. Their characters were rich and full and easy to believe were real people with real dreams and feelings. The ending could have been better, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie very much.

The development of MS Swank's character was excellent. We saw her character grow as a person as well as an athlete. I found myself caring whether she did well or not. The addition of the supporting cast used for her family did very well in making her personal values even more amazing. Cudos for the script on that account.

The directing of this movie deserved the recognition it got too. Flow and pace were good and the feel of the sets were very true to life. It got a 10 on my scale all the way around.

25 October 2005,Silent masterpiece,"Picked this one up off Sky box office and have to admit that I had never heard of it. Not quite keeping up with the latest movies as much as I'd like recently. Scrolled through and the synopsis looked good... and Clint Eastwood directing won me over..

An absolute masterpiece that pushes you through a roller-coaster of emotions. Brilliant. Clint Eastwood plays his usual, difficult and unforgiving role with a touch of brilliance.

Casting for this movie was really thought out by someone. Morgan Freeman, do I need to say any more.. The guy is an acting god and provides a kind of a Shawshank similar narrator role, along with an outright perfect performance on set.

As for Maggie, prepare yourselves to metaphorically adopt the girl during the movie and feel the ups and downs of the boxing world.

The film is based around boxing but I would say it draws more from human values. Do not put this one back on the shelf just because of the boxing, you'll be missing a classic.

Brilliant, watch it!",10
9 March 2008,What a movie!!,"I did not see this for a movie till today. Great movie with two great performances. Hilary Swank, I must say suited perfectly for the movie. Looked tough like a professional boxer. Clint Eastwood is a gem of an actor with even greater ability in directing the movies. Hillary's character depicts how to be tough, resolute and stay focused on the ambition.

Clint Eastwood's genius shows that a great movie does not require too much of budget of special effects. Just with dialogues the movie is great enough to move anyone. Easily the best sports movie I have ever seen.

17 April 2021,Tragic yet Inspiring,"As cliché as it may appear, it is a story about a stubborn middle aged lady who aspires to be a boxer who doesn't have any kind of proper training and then goes on to become a great boxer. It's pretty mainstream upto this point. Then comes the turning point in the movie which is the actual beauty of the film.

How the past stories of the characters unfold throughout and how it affects them now has been successfully portrayed.

Clint Eastwood plays the role of a grumpy old trainer who's not very willing to train Maggie( played by Hilary Swank) but eventually goes on to share a beautiful bond. The side stories of Morgan Freeman's character and a few fellow boxers are also beautiful and makes it a worth watch.

And perhaps the best thing - Morgan's voice as narrator- we've been there before right ;)",8

5 July 2010,Million Dollar Baby: Stunningly Brilliant,"If I'm not wrong, Million Dollar Baby was the first Clint Eastwood directed film I ever saw. A good number of years having passed since then, I recently decided to sit down and watch this again, to see if the original impression still stuck.

Having waitressed since her early teenage years, Maggie Fitzgerald has yearned for years to make it as a professional boxer. Introducing herself to aging trainer Frankie Dunn, she latches onto the crotchety sceptic, insisting he take her under his wing and refusing to take no for an answer.

As with all of his films, Eastwood's direction becomes instantly evident as a facet within the very first moments of Million Dollar Baby. The literal gritty darkness of his scenes form the basis of his work's appeal for me, the corresponding themes in no small part furthering this. Our early introduction to Dunn shows him as a classic Eastwood character of the latter day era: curmudgeonly; emotionless; granite- faced. His blank refusal to acquiesce to Maggie's unending requests comes as no surprise. The eager friendliness of Duff is a delight, her continual hope in spite of Eastwood's gruffness a bright and warm antithesis to his cold darkness. The inevitable change in this dynamic is well constructed, neatly avoiding the potential pitfall of seeming contrived and uncharacteristic. Fleeting moments of kindness punctuate Dunn's continuing harshness, gently developing him over the whole span of the film. Worth noting, most certainly, is Freeman. An exquisite supporting character, his Scrap is the sagacious guiding light of Dunn's conscience and morality, forging a formidable double act offering solid laughs as well as essential and unmissable dramatic scenes. The progress of Maggie's career is perhaps a little too cinematic, though never much the focus of the film. It relies constantly on the strength of the relationships of its characters, and on the fact that these are expressed almost wordlessly. Maggie's family, when we are unfortunate enough to encounter them, are sickeningly horrible people, telling us a great deal about her character in a most wonderful way. The film's final act is what sets it above most others: a beautiful, compelling, touching, unexpected, and masterful finale to a captivating character drama. Harder hitting than anyone in the film, it remains one of the most stunningly brilliant segues in cinematic history.

Bearing the hallmarks of Eastwood's ever exceptional direction, Million Dollar Baby combines a darkness in both lighting and subject matter with universally inimitable performances. Getting the very best from his actors as only he can, Eastwood takes us on an intoxicatingly enticing journey, dragging us through a minefield of emotion and giving us a truly unique experience, one of the best American cinema can offer.",8
8 July 2006,Hollywood does it again,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
21 October 2011,A haunting masterpiece... Disturbingly beautiful,"This movie defines beautiful. Hilary Swank delivers an amazing performance, as do the rest of the cast. As a female boxer myself I thought this movie was just so... Indescribable. You have to see it to believe it and every time you watch it again you notice something you just missed before. The themes and characterization and EVERYTHING is truly beautiful. The movie is a drama about two people who try to use each other to redeem their lives, however, the themes are far more complex than just that. An absolute must-see, this is an unforgettable story about the power of love and will and how even in the most unlikely of places-a boxing ring-it can affect peoples lives.

22 January 2005,A Gut-Wrenching Masterpiece,"I wonder why Clint is just up for Best Director and not Best Actor as well? He's phenomenal. Morgan Freeman is the epitome of acting, period and hopefully will win Best Supporting Actor. And Hillary Swank IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF. ""M.D.B."" is more than a movie--it's like a religious experience. I classify it as one of the greatest American movies of all time and in 50 years, they'll still be raving about it. Yes, it is overcast. It's dank, dark and seedy. It's depressing but nonetheless it is a REVELATION. A testament to the human spirit. A slap on the back to anyone who refuses to stop following that dream. A fantastic rags to riches to..to..that's all I'll say because I refuse to spoil such a brilliant film for anyone. If you have to stand in line an hour for a ticket, it's worth it.

The things that stand out in this is the performance. It's one of those films where everyone does an excellent job at performing their roles from Clint Eastwood to Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank and a star making role for How to Train Your Dragon's Jay Barushel. The lesson and story is also very well thought out given you a surprising ending to this seemingly Rocky-type movie that I was applauding but also sad when Eastwood didn't go generic. However the film does have it's flaws but none that really stand out that I can think off the top of my head. Even when I think about it I stubble to find many huge flaws. But I'm sure there are some flaws somewhere, not big ones but flaws nonetheless because there is no such thing as the perfect movie but this is pretty close to it. Now to grade this. Acting: A+ Story: A Characters: A- Music: C+ Overall: B+

31 July 2005,This Movie Changed My Life,"I saw this movie 2 weeks ago, and I still cannot stop thinking about it. It has made such a lasting impact on me  I watched it a second time a few days after the first viewing, and I cried at different moments in the film, the story is so rich and the movie is so well made. I must admit, I have never been a huge Clint Eastwood fan, but he has hit it out of the park with this movie. His directing, acting, the music - just phenomenal.

I realized when I was crying my eyes out at various points in the film that I had given up the fight in many respects in my own life. I don't want to ever give up the fight again, just like Maggie. Bravo to everyone involved with this film. Anybody can lose 1 fight. It is how you bounce back from the defeat that determines what you are truly made of.

12 January 2017,A searing movie,"I can not give this movie enough praise. I just can not. Acting. Direction. Story. Pacing. Just everything. I am afraid of saying too little for fear of not doing justice to the film but I am afraid of saying too much, I would rather just suggest you watch it and enjoy. This is by no means an easy film. I can however state with firmness that with each watch, it will unravel more layers to the story, the acting and the dialogue between the characters.

This movie will haunt you for a long time, for more reasons than I dare to put down here. I can only hope my minds picks up on the more happier scenes than the darker ones.

13 January 2005,"Heart-Warming, Amazing and very Thought Provoking","Not knowing anything about the film before watching it, I was amazed and taken aback by what seemed a ""by the numbers"" sporting drama was done.

Morgan Freeman's narration, and 2 of the most moving performances by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank all add up to a moving masterpiece that should live on for many years, and left me wanting more, yet glad that it ended when it did.

Within the space of 2 hours you see each character transform and ""grow"" as actions, decisions and consequences affect the life they lead. Comparable to Shawshank Redemption in terms of the mood of the film, the cinematography and the uplifting feeling, only good can come from watching this film and I urge you all to see it.

26 October 2022,Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood,"Not much to say. Just played my DVD of the movie that I bought almost 20 years ago, because tonight I needed some serious inspiration. Clint has made lots of good (and some bad).films. Hillary has chalked up fewer hits because she's so much younger. Not because she has less talent. But anyway, this combination is really hard to beat. It's true entertainment and not many movies really give you that. Especially when you watch them several times. I keep coming back because I respect and applaud both actor's talent..Plus all the behind the scene's people who flush-out the details that allow the actors to display why we love to watch them do their thing. My regards for everyone involved in this forever hit..

1 July 2005,Best film I have seen for a long while,"Maybe its my age, but I haven't seen a film so poignant for years. The acting is superb, the script is full of surprises.

I went to see this because I love Boxing and boxing movies. This is not a boxing movie, and Clint Eastwood is on top form both as Actor and Director. Morgan Freeman just goes from strength to strength, and Hillary Swank pulls off an acting performance that must have been both physically and emotionally demanding.

This would have been a 10 but for the simpleton character in the Gym who is not believable. Such characters exist in real life, but my experience is that Gyms never let them be ridiculed or bullied. It was also less than germain to the plot and a distraction with a highly predictable outcome.

I just wonder why I took so long to get around to seeing it.",9

15 October 2015,"A Profound, Mature Boxing Movie","There are two movies that Million Dollar Baby will immediately draw comparisons to--Raging Bull and Rocky. The reasons are obvious: boxing movies are a well-established genre, and any movie that enters the genre has to go up against the best. The good news is that Million Dollar Baby is not really like either movie, and attains a spot all its own in the genre. It does so by being a movie that locates its boxing plot within a very profound and mature view of the world, a view that sees the world's ugliness very clearly and moves its characters through it very realistically. It is a very truthful movie and a moving experience for the moviegoer.

The plot involves an aging boxing trainer, Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, who trains champions but has a bad habit of protecting them when their opportunity comes. He is currently training a potential champion, but the prospect leaves his gym when he realizes that Frankie is gun-shy. Frankie is devastated by this, but finds a new prospect in an enthusiastic young woman, Maggie, with knockout power and a completely dysfunctional personal life. The victories begin to mount, and it looks like Frankie's (and Maggie's) chance at redemption is on its way. The rest I can't reveal without tripping the spoiler alert, but I will say that those expecting a girl Rocky are going to be thrown off-balance.

In its outlook, Million Dollar Baby is a complete contrast to Rocky. While Rocky was made by a new, young filmmaker (Stallone) who captures what is ultimately a story of optimism, Million Dollar Baby is a story made by an old filmmaker (Eastwood) with a viewpoint which, if not pessimistic, is very sophisticated in identifying the particular aspects of life that are truly painful and difficult. This may seem like a downer, but the fact is that what you see is real--it is very refreshing to watch a real life and characters who show substantial courage as they make their way through. Frankie faces estrangement from his daughter, Frankie's janitor and resident sage, Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman) faces having gone one fight too many (he was a boxer) and Maggie, with her disaster of a family, faces the challenge of discovering some form of identity. The triumph of these characters is that they live at all, and in some respects they do transcend their circumstances. Unlike Rocky, it is an imperfect transcendence, and in some respects it often goes horribly wrong. But nonetheless, the richness of the conflicts and their resolutions makes this movie what it is. This and they amazing performances by veterans Eastwood, Swank and Freeman, and you really get the feeling of having seen something very deep.

With Million Dollar Baby, you might not by singing ""Gonna Fly Now"" or the ""Eye of the Tiger"" but, as the film says, you had better ""protect yourself at all times,"" because life can be even tougher than a boxing match.",9
4 September 2005,Not interesting at all unless you like boxing,"I have watched the movie, because I use to like movies which are directed by Clint Eastwood.

However, according to me this movie is a bummer. It is a movie which is only about boxing, which is a sport that I don't like at all. But the story is not that great either.

The fact that Hillary Swaink won the Oscar is weird. It cannot be because of her acting, because this is just an average Row. Nothing special.

In my opinion, the Oscar should have gone to Imelda Staunton for Vera Drake. Now that was really acting.

No, Clint has failed here and also the story was no good.

2 April 2006,Excellent! Yet not as good as Cinderella Man,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

4 March 2005,True greatness from Eastwood again!,"I saw this movie yesterday, and it maid such an impact that I now write my first comments on the IMDb. On the outside Baby is about woman boxing, but on the inside it's about personal lost and gaining. We follow a man who is wisecracking with his best friend a lot in the boxing studio and seems happy, but inside he is hurting a lot. Frankie is easily Eastwood's best role since ""Unforgiven"", he gives a emotional depth to the character I was dumbfounded by. Eastwood and Freeman workes great together, and the scenes they share are often very funny, like the dialogue you would expect between two old men who have shared a good 25 years together as friends.

In comes Hilary Swank as white trash Maggie, wanting to be a fighter. She's 31, and got some rough talent, but are a long way from being a professional boxer. Frankie at first doesn't want a woman in the gym, but is impressed by her anyway, so all end of course with him training her. Maybe he sees her as a second chance in life for a lost family member? Anyway, Maggie is extremely willing to train a lot to get to the top, and shows herself as one though lady in the ring. But will she go all the way and be world champion? It's one brilliant movie. Easily the best I have seen so far this year, and one that will live in the memory for a very long time. Eastwood, Freeman and Swank are great. Swank is like De Niro of the 21th Century, and gives one of the really big performances with her female fighter. I really fell in love with Hilary Swank and won't say anything of her destiny. It's a thrill ride with lots of humor and laughs, some good fights and some very touchy and sad scenes. Very recommended!",
19 February 2005,"More than just a boxing movie, BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!","For those of you who are claiming this to be the best boxing movie are complete idiots. This is not a ""real boxing"" movie. In fact, boxing is the ""minor theme"" of this movie. This movie is much more than just a boxing movie. It is about relationships, determination, regret, faith.... This is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. It is Eastwood at his best (acting and directing). I will not spoil the movie for those of who did not see it yet but I will say that I have never cried because of a movie but this movie was so touching and inspiring yet gut-wrenching and heartbreaking at the same time that I actually broke down and cried. Eastwood does a great job with the characters and you feel like you know them/attached to them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. This movie is clearly worthy of all 7 Acadmy Award nominations and I believe that Eastwood should win best director, Swank should win best actress, Morgan Freeman should win best supporting actor, and this film should definitely win Best Picture. Not only best film of 2005 but could be the best film ever made, definitely top 5 material.

7 September 2005,How to rescue a plain script,"OK, I'll admit it right away: I think boxing is a most barbaric activity. And anyone who enjoys it ought to get their head examined. Or punched at, just so they can ponder whether it's really a ""sport"".

As a result, the environment in which the action was set left me cold, if not upset. Still, I had decided to see that movie, out of curiosity  after all, it had won awards. The camera and lighting work was flawless and very creative. Hilary Swank does deliver an endearing image. Yet the whole story reeks of ""déjà vu"". The action is linear, usually predictable, and clichés about the tough guys mumbling in a barely understandable tone are, frankly, quite worn out.

Considering I had seen Ingmar Bergman's magnificent Saraband a few days earlier, I experienced quite a sobering evening with Million Dollar Baby.

Another case of Hollywood trying to act intellectual.",6

14 April 2012,Certainly one of the best Eastwood's films,"I have seen this movie fairly recently and I have been absolutely amazed by it. I have seen a lot of Clint Eastwood's movies in the past such as ""Invictus"", ""Letters of Iwo Jima"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""Gran Torino"" and so on... ""Million Dollar Baby"" is right at the top; Indeed, Mrs Swank, Mr Freeman and Mr Eastwood are spectacular. Their performances are outstanding through the entire movie and the story of this masterpiece is greatly inspiring. Before watching it, I was expecting another ""boxing movie"" but it was all but boxing. Of course, boxing is present however, the main plot is the relationship between Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. Anyone who will see this film will be shocked, amazed and inspired. ""Million Dollar Baby"" it is not only a ""must-see"" movie but a ""must-see"" Masterpiece. I firmly believe this movie is able to touch you in unique ways and I would recommend this movie to everybody. Great actors' performances, great music, great cameras' angles, great and epic scenes and amazing plot.

17 March 2022,A story about giving up...wtf,"The first three quarters of this movie made me yearn for Rocky. Equally depressing in its format, Rocky had a heart and spirit diametrically opposed to this film. A spirit which transcended the depressing environment it was set in. Where Rocky was about fighting till the end, this film at its heart is about quitting and giving up just when things get a little difficult.

Who knows what could have been achieved by Hilary had she put her mind to it. We will never know because her murderer put her to sleep instead of convincing her she could have invented/imagined great things.

The film felt hokey (including some very random boxing 'insights' such as moving from one foot to another) and it was populated by a lot of unpleasant characters. Clint trolling the priest made him very unlikeable. Just because he's too stupid to understand the significance of the Trinity does not mean the Trinity has no significance.

Morgan Freeman plays the same character from the Shawshank Redemption.

Rocky may have been fantasy but it was optimistic whereas this is totally negative. I didn't particularly enjoy.",5

20 July 2005,One punch and one knocked out,"I read a lot of reviews on million dollar babe and i havan't read on bad yet and i hope i'm never going to read one bad on this movie.

This movie is probable the best movie of 2004.Clint Eastwood did a very good job directing this movie.If Clint is planning on stopping directing movies or acting in movies, million dollar babe should not be the last one.

All i can say about this movie is the acting of this entertaining movie.The acting in this movie could'nt be any better except for Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) family members, Earline Fitzgerald (Margo Martindale), Mardell Fitzgerald (Riki Lindhome).Those two actors wasn't that great in this movie but it still made a very good movie.

28 March 2020,"If she didn't lose, the movie would be an ordinary Hollywood American dream. She loses and the movie wins","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9

10 February 2020,Pretty good movie... EMOTIONAL!,"So, life is a struggle, and we all have this things going on, on the inside, like fears, wants, dreams, emotions and tuff and they can be hard to deal with. It's not easy being a human, no it's not. And this movie tells a tale that really elevates this in a poetic and beautiful way, but sad as hell. If you enjoy feeling depressed, this movie should be right up your ally!

I found the Freeman's character very likeable. He was the best part, to me anyways. The spirited innocent girl and the grumpy old man with the sweet heart, was alright too. The boxing stuff, was good, felt authentic I guess. Beautiful color palet, I thought also, this movie had watching it on blue-ray last night. But the movie is extremely boring. And depressing.

I heard it won some Oscar's. Yes, I can see that, that sounds about right, this is like made for Oscar's, someone did their homework.

Anyway, pretty good movie. If you enjoy feeling depressed and bored, it's probably an amazing movie for you. I'm not joking. It's really good.",6
12 July 2005,One of the Best All-Around Acting Performances I've ever seen,"This movie deserved all of the Oscars it was nominated for and won.

Winner: Best Picture, Best Director (Eastwood), Best Actress (Swank), Best Supp. Actor (Freeman).

This movie follows the story of Maggie (Swank), a waitress near the poverty line who has one dream...to be a professional boxer. She saves every dime she has for weeks in order to buy a punching bag to prove to the local boxing trainer (Eastwood) that she has the will to be a great boxer.

This movie moved me in more ways than one. I will not spoil the ending, but it is one of the most dramatic surprises and turn-arounds in movie history. The acting performances of Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman were all spectacular and warranted every award garnered to them.

If you're looking for a carbon-copy of Rocky or a cookie cutter rise to the top film, this one is not for you. And do not let the movie's several fight scenes take away from the true meaning of the drama that unfolds.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I rank this movie in my top 10 just under Shawshank Redemption and Field of Dreams. Yes, this movie is that good. Please do yourself a favor and see the best movie of the year.",10
28 February 2005,Best Picture: A Masterpiece,"""Million Dollar Baby"", winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor is in a word...extraordinary. It is a motion picture as beautiful and rare as a precious gem.

Clint Eastwood crafted a masterpiece with deep characters and a brilliant, moving story. The film centers a around a grizzled old fight trainer and gym owner, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), his sidekick, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), and an aspiring female boxer, Maggie (Hilary Swank). The characters teach us that even though life can be hard dreams are worth pursuing because if we're lucky we all get one chance at achieving our dreams. We learn that no matter what happens to us, we're better off if we can say we had our shot.

Hilary Swank gave a stunning performance as Maggie and dazzles on the screen. Her work in this film is a lesson in acting and earned her, at the young age of 30, a second Academy Award win for Best Actress. She improves upon her Academy Award winning performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999).

Morgan Freeman earned his first Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor for his turn as a hardened, hard luck, wise old former boxer who manages Frankie's gym and looks after some of the boxing hopefuls who train there.

Early in the fall of 2004 when critics began to zero in on which films and performances were Oscar contenders, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was barely on their radar screen. That's because the film had been planned for a 2005 release and was not available early in the fall. Eastwood only began shooting the film in June of 2004, which would ordinarily be too late in the year for a film to be available for release that same year. But Eastwood filmed the movie in only 37 days. The beautiful screenplay by Paul Haggis needed no rewriting, and most scenes were filmed in one take. When studio execs at Warner Bros., which released the film, saw an early rough copy in the early fall, they were so impressed that they rushed the film so that it could be released in time to qualify for the 2004 Academy Awards.

Once it appeared, the critical acclaim for ""Million Dollar Baby"" was enormous. A.O. Scott of the New York Times marveled at the subtle beauty of the film and lauded its director, Clint Eastwood. He called it a masterpiece and proclaimed it the best film released by a Hollywood studio in 2004. Scott compared it to the classic films of Hollywood's heyday when pictures were in black and white. The popular critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated in his review, ""Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece, pure and simple, deep and true."" The film was instantly thrust into the running for the Best Picture Oscar and the buzz surrounding it began to grow.

After a brilliantly timed, modest Oscar campaign which included a limited December release and a nationwide release the weekend after the Academy Award nominations were announced, the film gained momentum so that by the time the Academy Awards show aired only a month later, ""Million Dollar Baby"" had become the new front runner for Best Picture. Early on, the front runner had been ""The Aviator"" (2004), the Howard Hughes biopic, directed by Martin Scorcese, which had captured the Golden Globe for best Drama Picture. ""The Aviator"" also garnered 11 Academy Award nominations compared to 7 for ""Million Dollar Baby.""

Among the film's 7 Academy Award nominations was a surprising acting nomination for Clint Eastwood. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for what many critics hailed as the best acting performance of his fifty year career.

""Million Dollar Baby"" also brought Eastwood a second Academy Award win for Best Director, for a film many critics believed to be his best work. He had won the Academy Award for Best Director previously for ""The Unforgiven"" (1992), which also took home an Oscar for Best Picture.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is the best film to win the Oscar for Best Picture in the '00s.",

11 March 2006,Johnny we hardly knew ya.,"This is a moving yet frustrating film about the short career of a female boxer trained by an old embittered manager/trainer who still feels responsible for his former-protégé-now-business-partner's loss of an eye many years before. The three main characters are played, respectively, by Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman -- all powerhouse actors. The problem is that none of them has much to work with: the plot feels more like an outline than a finished story. Perhaps Eastwood, who also directed, was trying to convey the idea that in the ethically dubious world of professional boxing people just don't know each other very well, or want to. However, that shallowness of character makes it awfully hard for us, as viewers, to identify with the potentially very dramatic events that occur. Hillary Swank again puts in a stellar performance as the androgynous woman who remains persistently feminine despite outward appearances, just as she did in ""Boys Don't Cry."" And one wonders throughout, as so often (""Levity"" in particular comes to mind) why Morgan Freeman doesn't get top billing when he is the top character and top performer in every respect.",7
2 February 2022,amirhoseinahg,"Million dollar baby is one of the best films of the 21st century for me and it has a lot of respect for its audience. Acting, directing, lighting and other technical factors are also at a very high level and the film is so effective that it can change its viewers.

Weaknesses: The soundtrack could have been better.

5 March 2005,A Sickening Blow,"Still in shock after watching ""Million Dollar Baby"". Well, watching most of it, anyway - I walked out towards the end, as the delicious pasta which I had enjoyed for dinner was threatening to make a reappearance.

Don't watch it.

The plot was thin, albeit original and depressingly plausible. The acting was good, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. The violence was horrible and nauseating.

The only thing I really give it credit for is that it must have taken a lot of courage to make the movie, and must have been very difficult to pitch. It's not an uplifting story. It's a terrible, tragic story with insufficient human insight to make it a worthy tragedy (such as, for instance, ""Macbeth"" or ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). The story gets progressively worse until it's appalling conclusion, which fortunately I didn't see.

It's afternoon the next day, and I still feel physically ill. I have a mental image of the most horrific moment of the film playing on a continual loop in my head, complete with stereo sound effects.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that anyone subject themselves to this movie.",1
14 February 2005,A powerful and spiritual journey from Clint Eastwood,"MIllion Dollar Baby

***1/2/out of 4

Clint Eastwood is growing older, but nothing can stop him from making original and emotionally powerful films. Many directors like Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack have turned to making huge Hollywood blockbusters with crowd-pleasing special effects. Eastwood has not. ""Million Dollar Baby"" defies all Hollywood boxing movie clichés and is certainly one of the best films of the year. Like Eastwood's American tragedy ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" is very pessimistic and takes dark and tragic turns. But, unlike ""Mystic River,"" it is a very spiritual film and feels much more personal.

Hilary Swank, in her 2nd best performance (""Boys Don't Cry"" being her best), plays Maggie Fitzgerald. Maggie is a white-trash girl who spends her time as a waitress when she's not in the boxing gym pushing towards her dream. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) owns the gym and when Maggie asks him to train her, his response is: ""Girly tough ain't enough."" Morgan Freeman, in his best role since ""The Shawshank Redemtion,"" plays Eddie Dupris. Eddie lost an eye when he was training with Frankie and Eastwood does a miraculous job of portraying the two aging friends' sense of loss. As Frankie begins to train Maggie, the film starts as a typical Hollywood film, but then takes an unexpected turn, making an exciting boxing film into a heart-wrenching journey of the human soul. Eastwood's use of extensive lighting gives a sense of all the guilt and sin in the seemingly normal atmosphere. Also, the musical score, as in ""Mystic River,"" is very simple and quiet--one of the reasons why it stays with you so much. Like ""Closer"" and ""Collateral,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the few widely- released films this year that surely proves itself, with the help of a masterful artist, to be an extraordinary work of art.",

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",5
16 January 2022,"""I never had the chance to get what I wanted""","Undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. Clint Eastwood's name seems to be enough for a film to succeed.

Maggie managed to experience ""living"" during her short life, and when she had to just ""survive"" without ""living"", she decided to die.

But how about us? We went for what we wanted to be; Or are we doing things we are not interested in just to get through the days and ""survive""? Do we still have a chance? Can we say to ourselves before death, ""I think I did a good job""?

24 August 2020,An emotionally powered story.,"If you want to see a film that's beautifully acted, directed, scored, and paced, and, which burrows it's way into your heart and soul so that you'll be thinking about it long after you view it, look no further. If this film fails to both entertain you and move you then you're surely made of stone.

23 March 2023,Mo Cuishle.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life.

24 August 2005,Too much fuss for its own good,"I'm not being very generous with the stars here, as I'd expected much of this Oscar-winner, and it left me with a feeling that someone had edited the best bits out of my copy of the DVD. Maybe it's a genuine step forward for a Clint Eastwood movie, but the man must be about a hundred, and he's in no danger of catching up with the cutting edge of world cinema. Most of the movie plods along pleasantly enough, with shades of Shawshank in atmosphere but not a great deal to back it up. Then it rushes headlong through matters of real importance and my overall impression was somehow of cosy predictability. Given the nature of the subject matter (I won't spoil it for you, but as you may have heard the later part of the movie is not so cosy in content), this is both ironic and appalling!

Million Dollar Baby is not a bad movie, and I did enjoy it, and Hollywood can do much worse, but don't rent it thinking you're getting a film of the year.

Million Dollar Baby is also a great title for a movie, but not this one. They appear to have lifted it from either one of two pre-war features; I don't know.",4
26 February 2021,The legend of Mo Chuisle.,"I thought this was plain sports movie, and I occasionally like those, because I had never really heard about this movie, but it definitely took me by surprise - Putting me on an emotional ride through the 2 hours of run time. This is both a good boxing movie, and all around greatly produced piece of entertainment that I think no matter if you're a fan of the sport of boxing or not, you will enjoy, as the performances and story is just amazing. That they didn't just take the basic route that you've seen so many times in sports movies.

It came to me as a surprise that there wasn't any montage of boxing, but that they actually explained the different techniques and chose to show the progress in both the training and in the ring, as she got better and better for each fight. It was also a nice ""twist"" that she wasn't just one of the top tier boxers, or even that good at all, in the beginning at least. That even though she had been grinding at the sport for quite some time, she still hadn't found her footing, and gotten to her full potential, and even knowing this herself still managing to keep a positive mindset and have the mentality of a fighter, all because she was doing what she loved.

Still keeping it raw though, showing the brutal side, on the same level as the great. The fights were shown using great cinematography, sound mixing and music, but also by the awesome performances by its cast, showing the addictive and fun side, but still managing to show the challenge it brings both physically and mentally. The fights really made you feel like you were there in the audience, and... in the end I honestly had to google if it was based on real events, as everything just felt so real and authentic.

24 March 2005,I usually don't enjoy sad movies. . .,"I like to think that I'm not particularly fast to choose a film for the ""best film""/ ""favorite film"" title. However, I woke up this morning after seeing the film and remembered watching it last night. The movie stuck in my head for some reason, and it may be the best I've ever seen.

The best thing going for it is the power of Morgan Freeman's voice as a narrator. I truly enjoyed Shawshank Redemption, and this film went further to show the power of his voice.

However, the true strength in the film is the run-of-the mill young boxer/ old weary trainer bit, but pushed to the next level. The film goes beyond boxing itself, to a much more human and realistic perspective.

The movie doesn't try to develop ALL characters, but concentrates well on just three. The events that occur within the characters' past and present mold them and pull the viewer into the trenches with them.",10
8 April 2005,Wow!,"Million Dollar Baby is one of those films which leaves you sitting in silence as the end credits roll. The silence is one of awe, but also one akin to being unable to speak after being floored by a sucker punch. ""I didn't see that coming"" will be the prevalent thought.

The film starts predictably enough; a 31-year-old girl (Swank) wishes to become a champion boxer, and to achieve that she seeks the best trainer around: Frankie (Eastwood). Although he initially refuses she continues to train and, after Frankie's friend (Freeman) intervenes and convinces him, he decides to train her. Under Eastwood's coaching she progresses rapidly, ultimately earning a championship shot. At this point you would be forgiven for believing this film to be a simple boxing movie, a female version of Rocky. However, Eastwood and writers Paul Haggis and F.X. Toole have loftier ideas than this, and it is here the knockout punch is delivered to the audience, taking the film in a radically new direction.

The film cleaned up at the Academy Awards, and deservedly so, for it is a truly great piece of film-making. Eastwood and Swank are certainly worthy of their awards (for Best Director and Best Actress respectively) but it is Freeman who is the outstanding turn here. In a typical understated role, as both Frankie's friend and the narrator, it is he who lends the film sincerity and gravitas. His chemistry with Eastwood in particular is excellent, thanks partly through their prior experience together on Eastwood's earlier Unforgiven. Freeman has long been a mainstay of Hollywood, and his Best Supporting Actor award is both richly earned and long overdue.

Eastwood's handling of some delicate material towards the end of the film, although brave, is commendable, and the change in direction, whilst not quite a twist on the level of The Usual Suspects, is an intriguing one. Overall a rather harrowing film, and although it is a film to be savoured, it is not one that can be watched comfortably a second time.",9
8 October 2007,Superb Film and Raw Acting,"One of the best films I have seen. It is not just a story depicting boxing as a sport but the story behind people's anguish in life behind the sport.

I have always watched the movies of Hilary Swank and unsurprisingly, she always gives an excellent raw acting that no Hollywood actress can emulate. She really deserved to be the runaway winner of different award giving bodies.

For Clint Eastwood, he is really good in directing movies with a surprise ending. He is really a good director and approach his films as raw(real) as possible. As far as I can recall, when he directs films, the actors that are involved has been given citations for their acting. Morgan Freeman has been consistently excellent in his movies and particularly to this film.

Very touching movie and a bit intellectual. I think most of the insensitive people would get bored to this movie.",9
5 August 2006,Loved It!,"I would recommend this movie to everybody! Great Storyline Great Action Great movie. I will surely see this movie again and again!. Its is not often that you find a movie of this class everybody that i have recommended this movie to also loved it, Its a pity it got such a spot on the top 250 because i would definitely rate it higher. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are great together they provide what the movie needs for Action even though i loved Hillary Swank's role in it to, very feisty and yet so relaxed. the movie does have some bad point indeed but that makes the movie the best of its genre.at first i thought that it would be a boring movie until i actually watched it and loved it.

16 January 2005,This film broke my heart........(that's good),"This film broke my heart. I saw it two nights ago, and every time it enters my mind (which is every 5 minutes or so), I well up. I don't even like boxing, but that is not what this film is about. To me, it is a love-story of a would-be father and a would-be daughter. It is about a girl with nothing, wanting to prove that she has self-worth and a deep yearning to find a father-figure that is proud of her. However, this movie is about so much more than that.

The lighting, editing and sparse scoring are perfect. I long so much to help Maggie, and feel that she is REAL, not just a fictional character from a movie.

I have NEVER been this moved by a picture, and if any film should win just about every Oscar this year, it is Million Dollar Baby.

Clint, thank you for reminding us what real movies are all about: Character Development.

If there was ever a movie that fully embodied the ""American Spirit"".....THIS IS IT!!!!!

17 January 2005,"Beautiful, emotional, career best for Clint Eastwood","You've already heard it, but I'll say it again: don't make the mistake of thinking this is just another ""Rocky"" or ""Karate Kid"" underdog-with-a-crusty-mentor-comes-out-on-top story. Forget about how you think you feel about ""boxing movies"" and go see this one anyway. See it before you hear too much discussion about it (don't ruin the experience of finding out for yourself how the story goes), and see it with someone, for you'll be dying to discuss it afterward. It's not quite as ""sappy"" (in a good way) or outwardly romantic as Eastwood's ""Bridges of Madison County"" (which I also loved), but you'll leave the theater with the same feeling--tearful but inspired--and it will hover around you for days. I echo star Hilary Swank's comments during her Golden Globe win and say that Clint Eastwood gives the performance of his career, as well as perhaps his finest directing feat. One of the most absolutely beautiful, inspiring movies you'll ever see.

13 June 2006,Brilliant!,"WOW!best picture of 2004 at the academy awards what can i say.Clint Eastwood directs this brilliant movie,I never thought much of him as an actor but as a director hes becoming a fascinating venture. 1.THE STORY flawlessly written. is about a young trailer trash park women with a Will to succeed in the boxing ring.she finds a helper/trainer with his own demons to deal with and together they find comfort.If you are expecting a girl rocky give up now cause you will be disappointed.this movie is not for people who think die hard was the best movie ever it is a thoughtful character study. 2.THE Performances Hilary swank is good as Maggie she is so natural you don't feel shes even acting.Morgan as always does not disappoint that Oscar was long overdue and clintwood is also good as Frankie Dunn the wrinkled old boxer.But truth be told Hilary did not need another Oscar especially for this role though shes good the role is not much demanding as the other nominees in that year she won for this role but she made audiences cry and feel for her character and swayed many votes her way""Imelda Stanton"" was robbed for Vera drake.Morgan on the other had has had better performances in his career but regardless of other nominees that Oscar was long overdue",9

13 January 2018,My favourite movie of all time,"I've rewatched Million Dollar Baby almost every year since it's release (about 10 times). I won't know why, but i just keep coming back. This movie sends out a big message to me which is 'pursue what you love in life to the best you can'.

The movie makes my cry from the sheer power in Maggie's character. Sure she's strong physically, but her willpower and passion is where she is a knockout. Hillary Swank outshines any performance i've ever seen in acting in this movie and every scene involving her is powerful. I remember (after seeing this movie) watching most movies she's acted in and seeing her supreme acting skills shine through in all roles. Clint Eastwood is also top notch as Frankie, and the bond that develops between fighter and trainer is so well done and tasteful.

Sure there are some extreme moments a little overdone at times like the absurd sheer ignorance of her family or the rediculous fighter she ends up competing with for the title. However, these extreme moments only make it more emotional and make you feel more strongly with the two main characters who are just trying to do a little good in the world.

I come out of the movie with Maggie and Frankie feeling as role models and people to look up to in rough times. Make the most of your life whilst you have it. Prove to yourself you've got what it takes in whatever you do!

This movie is almost in my heart as a true great!",10

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",5
3 March 2005,Most over-rated film of the century,"Having watched a few days after the movie grabbed the Best Picture Oscar, I cannot but record that it was a big let down. I haven't yet seen the other Oscar nominees of 2004, but then Beautiful Mind, American Beauty, Forrest Gump and English Patient too have won that Oscar (not to mention the all time greats such as Gone with the Wind, Midnight Cowboy and Kramer Vs Kramer) Is this movie on par with those? The movie does not truly explore the human relationships since we are not aware of many circumstances of the main actors. There appears to be a father-daughter relationship but we are not aware of the real father-daughter relationships of them. So how can we be sure? Are we supposed to read the book too? I am reminded of great story tellers such as David Lean who in Ryan's Daughter and Doctor Zhivago told complex stories while at the same time delving into the depths of human and social spirits.

I have a feeling that ""Raging Bull"" is far ahead in exploring the human being beneath the boxer than this film. This is perhaps the most over-rated film so far in this century. Perhaps the super-human scale of Clint Eastwood is too overpowering. But all tear-jerkers are not good films.",5
27 November 2005,Pass,"This movie is an overlong unbelievable tear jerker. I went to see it at someone else's request and expected a Rocky equivalent. That was a great movie. This was a mess.

Hollywood likes to parade old actors who have accepted their senior status. They should do the same for actresses, but that is another point. I am not a Clint Eastwood fan, but he is good in this film. And the girl is too.

The thing should have ended with the heroine getting her lights punched out and then trying to figure out what to do with the rest of her life if they wanted realism. But no,they went for the tear ducts.

To write and produce a movie that is truly tragic, a Rocky who gets creamed and drops like a, well, rock in a lake is much more difficult and much more real. This flick went for the sure and easy bet.

Not a good script or film.",5
19 September 2020,Blows of fate,"Clint Eastwood had lost the well-deserved Oscar with 'Mystic River' a year before releasing 'Million Dollar Baby', a film that, together with its predecessor, demonstrates the talent of a director and actor who has worked for years with stories that portray very humans, albeit corrupted, in adverse situations or in conflict with themselves. 'Million Dollar Baby' would come to establish the highest point in the career of its author with a story that well drinks from the usual Eastwood classicism and a couple of unbeatable performances to tell a story full of dreams and blows. In the first half, dreams that materialize in an aspiring boxer (flawless Hilary Swank) with hopes of achieving her dream and winning a million dollars, leaving behind a life of loss and poverty. As a counterpart is Frankie, played by Eastwood himself, a man with his broken dreams, but who finds in this new boxer his redemption and perhaps a family. In this sense, if dreams are what moves the characters and the plot, the blows are what stop everything. Both physical and internal blows are abundant and portray a devastating panorama, even with all the hopes that live in him and his characters, who after all are people who have received blows all their lives, in a ring and in a personal way. But the most painful thing is when the blows are directed at the viewer in the second half of the film. More and more hits to see on the screen and finally a ""knockout"" that leaves a sad and real scene. We could say that this is Eastwood's best film for bringing an abysmal amount of feelings and emotions to the visual plane, creating a dark but hopeful atmosphere. But perhaps what truly makes it his best film is that it brings together the best of his filmography at an age of maturity and absolute perfection.",10
15 March 2005,"Great film, but still somehow overrated.","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

3 April 2015,"A movie about strong relationship, dream, and desperation. One of the BEST movies in 21st century !","The best work from clint eastwood. This movie on par with ""Unforgiven"" but better in movie-making. As a director, eastwood still among the tops in 21st century. And with MDB, he already made a movie which considered as masterpiece in early 21st.

All performances from actors and actresses should be given credit. The shot in boxing scene nearly reach ""Raging Bull"". And writing is beautiful, this movie is one kind of movie that will be remembered years later after the first watch. It contains beautiful relationship drama alongside dreams and desperations. Tears definitely will drops for hours.

I give this movie 10/10 because i know this movie will be considered as future classics. Deep, original, superbly-acted, above average cinematography, and absolutely beautiful yet sharp storyline.

5 August 2005,Great directing. Great mixture of Boxing and Personal feelings,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Not only with the boxing where there so called shouldn't be any heart involved it was complimented with a deep emotional theme.

Not only did Clint Eastwood play the the role of Franky so well he also did an excellent job directing this. Morgan Freeman is an great actor as well he never lets his viewers down. Hillary Swank was the perfect actress for this part. With her wit and natural charm she draws viewers to her cause shes so sweet. This was difinately a tear jerker for me. The only thing I would have liked to happen is that Franky makes amends with his daughter Katy.

8 August 2005,I was never bored...,"If you are a fan of the movies, and you probably are since you have come to IMDb and are reading movie reviews, then you will probably not be bored during Million Dollar Baby. The story and the characters are interesting enough to keep your attention and I didn't have any issues with the pace of the movie, but this was a fairly average movie. What was well done? The performances by Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman were superior and easily the best part of the film. I'm not entirely sure why Morgan Freeman decided to rasp his already deep voice for the film as it was unnecessary. Lighting was used very effectively throughout enhancing the dark nature of the film. Other than those facets, I had a few problems with the movie.

Perhaps I would not be so disappointed had this film not won the award for best picture. I don't understand the fascination with Clint Eastwood in Hollywood. He is an excellent actor, but his directorial skills are pretty average. He doesn't do anything particularly unique to enhance a movie or tell the story in a different way.

It seems to me that he also missed an opportunity in the movie. Since the story centers on loneliness and love and opportunity, he could have used silence effectively. That being said, the entire narration of the movie could be eliminated in favor of silence and the movie may have been a little more powerful. There were also several unrealistic points in the movie, such as certain occurrences in the boxing matches and in his conversations with the priest that just wouldn't happen in normal situations.

This movie was okay. It wasn't great and it wasn't horrible - definitely not best picture worthy.",6
26 January 2005,Eastwood At His Best,"My wife and I just returned from the Canadian Premiere of Million Dollar Baby. The movie was riveting from start to finish. It was definitely the best movie I have seen in the last year and maybe the best in a few years. The story blended some great humor, some great fight and action scenes and a gut and heart wrenching story. There were so many story lines in this movie. There was Morgan Freeman's depiction of a retired fighter left wanting for more. There was Hillary Swank's struggle from rags to riches and her struggle to prove she was capable of fighting in a sport dominated by males. There was Clint Eastwood's gripping story of lost love and unfinished dreams. They were all mixed together so well. There are so many things that one can take from this movie and one that people will be talking about for years to come.

30 May 2005,brilliant,"I loved this movie precisely because it was nothing to do with boxing. Clint Eastwood focused more on the raw emotion of all the actors than rough boxing matches. The ending of this film really tugs on your heartstrings. The lighting of the movie is another indication that Clint Eastwood is as good at directing as he is at acting. Every character is almost hidden in shadows, giving the impression that all is not as it seems. Morgan Freeman gives an amazing performance and his narration really helps.

This film has everything, comedy, sport, comedy, and a little love. If you haven't already, go and see this movie, I t is brilliant.

4 June 2005,inspiring movie,"When Million dollar baby first came out, I didn't expect so much, especially after seeing a lot of bad movies about boxing, so I thought this one will be soon forgot. But when I came out of the theater I felt something I hadn't felt in a lot of time. This movie makes you think, makes you want to reach your dreams and it even makes you cry. It has a very moving and inspiring story and Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are so good in their performances that, in some scenes, you almost forget that they're talking about old socks and lemon pie. This was one of the greatest surprises at the Oscar night, but, I'm really glad it won best picture.

25 January 2019,Neverending happiness,"Clint eastwood never ceases to amaze others and in this epic boxing movie he does it once again. Among so many boxing movies out there like raging bull, southpaw, cinderella man, the fighter, rocky etc you always search for a one which is different from the others and this is the one. Incredible performance by Eastwood and swank leaves you crying in the end, the end which is worth remembering a lifetime. Absolute masterpiece definitely gotta see it.

3 November 2017,Average people can do incredible things,"I've been pretty moved with this movie. You don't even have to like boxe, I don't. If you like clever, beautiful dramas, I recommend it.

First, the acting. It's really pleasant to see how the old trainer (Clint Eastwood) is so confused by Maggie (Hilary Swank) who won't listen to anything he says about getting another coach, going to another club. She just wants him as a coach and no one else. You can feel how Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but then he starts to like her, and this is made in a very subtle acting. Both Eastwood and Swank are outstanding.

Frankie and Maggie have deep psychology, especially Frankie who is really conflicted, and are well-developed throughout the movie. Maggie is an average waitress who realizes she can actually do something great by motivation. It's really interesting to see average people evolving but not much but pure willingness. She stands up to Frankie, it looks like he doesn't really have a choice, she's so stubborn !

Photography is beautiful as well, close shots emphasizing drama, not taking risks but mastering the manual in a nutshell.

Now what's wrong. Some really random scenes disturb the narration. They even talk about socks for a WHOLE scene, and it's not presented like it's supposed to be funny, or philosophical or anything, it's just socks, really.

About the weird, retarded boxing guy : this is SO badly written. It looks like he is not finished as a character, that he should be in another movie or something. In 2 hours, scenes about him spawn randomly. This serves no purpose.

Ending's great because it doesn't follow expectations about your average boxing movie.

TLDR; not flawless, but still one of the best dramas, I recommend. If you like uplifting boxing movies, be sure to check out ""Bleed for this"", too.",7
18 January 2005,"wanted to like this so much, but...it ended up sucking","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",
8 February 2005,Why didn't he talk to his daughter?,"Did anyone wonder why his daughter wasn't speaking to him? Or what happened to his wife? I thought they should have clued us in. I do have a theory that might be a stretch---he went through the same thing with his wife--the mercy killing and that's why he was wrestling with God and the church and had so many issues with the decision. And when the priest said he would be agonized for the rest of his life if he did the mercy killing he had in actuality already been agonizing. That's why he so adamantly refused her request at first.

And perhaps he had a fight with his daughter over the whole thing and that's why they didn't speak.

30 September 2017,"Very overrated, very uninteresting movie.","This movie was very dissapointing to me. There seems there are some few of the movies from 2000-2010 that i really don't like as much as everyone else. Fortinently, that is one of the things i love about movies and cinema, because everyone is different, and everyone has a different view. Some movies, people agree more if it's good or bad, and some movies, people just don't agree at all.

I cant seem to see whats so entertaining about this movie. The main character is just really annoying for the most part throughout the movie, which is a very common problem in a lot of movies with women who star in the lead role nowadays, because the movie industry pushes way too hard when it comes to the feministic views and equality (of course it's good they care, but they overdo it a lot these days and ruin parts of many movies for me with this because the lead role is such an important part of a movie....) , but Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood are fantastic as usual, legends as they are. Without Freeman and Eastwood, this movie probably wouldn't have been good at all, and they made the film and gave this movie some good qualities, and it is because of them this movie at least became mediocre.",5
3 March 2005,"Excellently executed, ""pulsating"" story","I have just seen the movie yesterday. I would completely agree with the previous comment by Andrew DiMonte - I will only add a few impressions of the way the movie has been made and the moving story presented.

Everything, witch has to be said about the story, has been said by Andrew already, only the fact that the life of the characters is dramatically changed after a period of time. You would think, watching it, the film could be a straight, ""easy to digest"" story till the end, but it's not.

As to the technique of the movie - from my point of view, witch gathered my attention from the beginning - is that the sources of expressions are simple, I would say somewhat ""rough"", yet they are so reach in their meaning. The interiors, tempo of the action, even acoustic effects, shallow echos of the sounds, pauses - remind me the characteristics of theater - the climate of the scene and the special relation between actor and the audience - that's what really matters in this film.

You must see this movie. Regardless of who you are, you will find a reflection, to take back with you...",9

22 September 2019,And that search for regard is what makes flirting with greatness this strong boxing drama.,"That's the message from this movie. As Unforgiven was about guilt and regret, Million Dollar Baby zeroes in on the brutal, primal appeal of ""The Sweet Science."" Perhaps we've seen too many versions of poor men using the deadly sport as their only way to ""be someone,"" as Brando put it in On the Waterfront. Give a woman that dream and you bring home the risk, and show why she's willing to take it.Respect, only a different type of love. And that search for regard is what makes flirting with greatness this strong boxing drama.

22 July 2005,A roller coaster of fun and despair,"I would give this a 10 if it filled in a few more gaps for me but the movie would have been 4 hours long if it did. Hilary Swank was fantastic in this and you can't help but fall in love with her attitude, determination and unselfishness. Clint was perfect in this role, he reminded me of my grandpa, angry at the world in his own lovable way. My biggest criticism is that they don't go into enough of his past to explain him. Morgan Freeman plays perfectly right along side Clint and they do a great job playing the roles of long time friends. There is a magical touch to this film that is indescribable, you can feel the connection between the characters and you feel like you are watching something real. Unfortunately the ending leaves you a little down and incomplete. I think they could have cut that shorter and spared me the long drawn emotional pain. All in all it was a great film and definitely worth your time.

14 August 2005,Disappointed,"Hmmm. Well, I was hoping for a bit more uplifting show than what I got, maybe not a full blown Rocky movie, but surely not this. However that's not why I wound up voting a '2'. It wasn't ""awful"", but very disappointing.

Yeah, I thought the acting was very good, especially Hilary. But, I was disappointed in Clint's character, he just never became a character I was invested in. I didn't wind up caring where he wound up. I was even more disappointed in the missed opportunity for Morgan's character. After developing his character, the plot just left him dangle, and didn't take any advantage of both Morgan, and the character's opportunity to be key to the plot. He was left to be more of an afterthought. Morgan himself was great as always, but he just wasn't fully exploited.

Worse was the boxing. I read comments, here, comparing this movie to the best boxing movies. How? The action was Rocky-like (fake and exaggerated). That in itself might have been overlooked, however to allow the fouls (late shots, and after the bell shots) to pass, was criminal. The shot Hilary took WAS criminal. Think ESPN and today's media would allow that to pass, and the current champ to just rock on ? No way.",2

15 March 2005,formulaic and self-indulgent,"While this comment goes against the tide of popular opinion, I believe that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is tediously self-indulgent and formulaic. From the opening moments of this overly-long, predictable movie, the audience is presented with one clichéd situation after another - in fact towards the end of the film, one can practically see the kitchen sink descending! Many of the characters are nothing more than stereotypes - particularly the boxer's trashy and unscrupulous family.

Swank's acting skills cannot be faulted, but one becomes very tired of Eastwood's deeply soulful gazes, as he metamorphoses from an impatient curmudgeon, reluctant to undertake the training of a ""girlie"" boxer to a deeply caring father-figure.

None of the characters is explored in depth. Instead we have hackneyed situations, inducing a strong sense of deja vu. Haven't we encountered these themes and these character types in one form or another before? Morgan Freeman is an extremely capable actor, but hasn't he assumed a similar persona in many other films? ""Shawshank Redemption"" comes to mind, for a start.

I realize that ""Million Dollar Baby"" will have much popular appeal, since the film demands no challenging cerebral activity from its viewers, but instead shamelessly manipulates their emotions. For my part, I found the movie to be a nauseating concoction of schmaltz, political correctness and predictability.",3

10 September 2021,Most overrated Eastwood film,"The Good:Solid performances by Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank. The Bad:Script is predictable and cheesy. The Ugly:Scene with the stool,Swank's family and the end scene in the hospital. No strike that. Not ugly, flat out ridiculous. Any Eastwood film is better than this. Hell you watch Tarantula for a more believable script and better acting.

6 January 2005,Stunning,"Last night I saw Clint Eastwood's latest film, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and it is worthy of a million compliments. As one has come to expect from their past performances, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all deliver dead-on portrayals that should ensure many nominations and, if justice prevails, some awards. Morgan Freeman's ability to keep his voice checked while conveying powerful, searing truths is unmatched. Hilary Swank delivers a combination of raw toughness and undaunted optimism that is incongruously based in pain. Clint Eastwood only gets better with age. This movie had most of the audience sniffling by the end. If you found ""Mystic River"" heart-wrenching, you will find ""Million Dollar Baby"" a worthy follow-up.

22 July 2021,So touching story.,"So good movie.

I just love it.

Amazing performances.

Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman were great, but i'm amazed how much work Hilary Swank had to do for this role. So physical role.

I don't know much about boxing but i know that all those fighting scenes were so well done.

I laughed and i cried so many times during this movie.

I don't really know is ending happy or sad. Or both.",10
2 November 2005,Good parts but the pieces don't quite fit together,"In this drama, Clint Eastwoods character reluctantly becomes the trainer of a lonely woman (Hilary Swank), who is actually too old to become a boxer.

The acting is superb, the characters very interesting, the career and the training of the main character as a boxer is a fantastic and moving story to follow. The production, the music, the pictures are all flawless. This movie is worth watching indeed.

But the movie is uneven and the pieces don't quite fit together. The separate parts are very very good, but they make no sense in the same movie.

Why o why o why did they have to put on a narrator voice, especially as it is Morgan Freeman who tells the story, and we have already heard this exact narrator tone from him in ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It adds possibly nothing to the story.

I have nothing against the sadness of the ending. But this whole long last part adds so little to the story, it is sad for the sadness sake sometimes. There were so much more to get here, and it could be much much more connected to the story in general. As now, the end almost feels like a separate movie.

There are more unsatisfactory left out pieces. Many touching stories and people are thrown into the story, but too little is known, too little explored and too unconnected to the main story or some theme of the movie, for their story to capture you as they could have.

But overall the movie is good and worth watching.",6
1 August 2005,"Good Start, Horrible Ending....","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award.

20 January 2005,Emotionally shallow,"I really cannot understand all of the fuss about this movie. I saw it last night and I found it emotionally shallow, very predictable, and, although Eastwood directs with great skill, and many other elements are deftly contrived, the characters are so clichéd that that I found myself getting quite bored, and I stayed uninvolved throughout.

The characterisations in particular were a joke - i,e, the forthright priest, the trailer trash family, and the scrawny kid in the Gym. Most of all the coach, played by Morgan Freeman was used in such a predictable way, and the 'villains' were so obvious, it was simply laughable. In short, what this film lacked was emotional honesty and some sense of reality. I would only rate this a 5/10.

8 April 2005,"Clint Eastwood's Million ""Duller"" Baby","Like ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" confuses in-your-face melodrama with profoundness. Subtlety is definitely not one of Eastwood's directorial strengths. The film also has its motley crew of caricature characters like Maggie's obnoxious ""white trash"" family who act more like her personal demons than anything. They live only to swing the pendulum of sympathy towards Maggie in very neatly demarcated zones of good and evil.

But sympathy is difficult to give when it is so obviously solicited. Characters wallowing in contrived dramas hardly elicit interest, let alone sympathy. As respected film critic Roger Ebert pointed out, ""Deep movie emotions for me usually come not when the characters are sad, but when they are good."" In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" the characters are more sad than good.

Nonetheless, the film won awards for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director. This is not about the Academy paying tribute to a future film classic, it is about the Academy paying its last respects to its favorite 74-year-old cowboy. True enough, in the film's last moments, the Frankie character disappears.

Ultimately, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ""Rocky""(Progesterone version) meets ""Terms of Endearment"" (plus the narration cut-and pasted from ""The Shawshank Redemption""). How's that for cinematic schizophrenia?",6
31 January 2005,This film is worthy of ten stars. It's one hell of a masterpiece!,"Mr. Eastwood has proved, yet again, what a master craftsman he is in front and behind the camera. From a great actor to a great director, as well as a great jazz composer, this man is a genius who deserves every award they can bestow on him! The Aviator pales next to this marvelous film, truly. Sorry, Marty, but you may have to wait a bit longer for that Oscar on your mantelpiece. Morgan Freeman narrates and as usual acts up a storm, as does the magnificent Hilary Swank, in a film so deeply moving and unforgettable, you will wind up going to see it again. Clint, you have been, and remain a true master of the art form we call cinema. Bravo, sir, bravo!

19 April 2005,"If you like emotional self-flagellation, you'll love this movie","Throughout his career Clint Eastwood's roles have walked a fine like between being morally right and being morally wrong. In this movie he once again falls down on the wrong side of that line with a resounding ""thud"". His character's decisions are ones that no human has a right to make. I can say no more about this particular movie, but if his movie career is examined from the very beginning, we see him glory in violence and killing on manufactured and contrived pretexts, and he goes on. It is no exaggeration to say that his influence on western civilization has been very great; it has also been very unfortunate. If the world was full of Clint Eastwoods, we'd be in a lot of trouble.

31 August 2005,I Remember Rowdy Yates.............,"I've watch Clint Eastwood on TV and film nearly all my life - and I've watched him become the full-rounded actor/director he is today. He hasn't tried to stay with all-action hero as he's got older, and a good decision that's been. Now he is capable of turning out a small masterpiece like this. I don't like boxing, but this movie held me enthralled. All the actors played their parts wonderfully well. Miss Swank was totally believable, and Eastwood and Freeman bickering relationship sets the film off perfectly. The fight scenes are well filmed and I found myself wincing as each punch landed. I won't spoil the film for by giving anything away, but I suspect the Eastwood/Swank scenes at the end will challenge the hardest of hearts. Please, even if you don't like boxing, go and see this. You won't regret it.

6 April 2005,"A predictable affair, but moving all the same...","Million Dollar Baby

Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing coach who runs a modest back alley gym with Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), one of his former protégés. He spends most of his days writing letters to his estranged daughter that are returned unopened, heckling the local priest (Brian O'Byrne). Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a female boxer with a raw, promising talent, who wants to rise above her ""white trash"" background and train under the tutelage of Frankie. Frankie is at first reluctant, but soon warms to the woman, and helps make the breakthrough into the boxing world that Maggie has dreamt of for years. But when an unexpected and tragic event takes place, Frankie, Eddie and Maggie are forced to re-evaluate if Maggie has reached her full potential.

Undoubtedly, the first half of 'Million Dollar Baby' is a terribly predictable affair, utilising plot devices present in countless sports underdog dramas since the overrated Syllvester Stallone picture, 'Rocky'. There's no way past the fact that there really is nothing new here, but this well-worn material has found itself in the ring with a well-honed cast, and filmmaker Clint Eastwood. Eastwood has taken up directorial, producing and scoring duties, but, like his past twenty-four pictures, has left the screenplay to another: Paul Haggis (adapting stories from F.X. Toole's 'Rope Burns' books), a writer with a background in television, who has made an assured dramatic debut here.

It's also pleasing to see Clint Eastwood in an acting role, and his solid performance here is excellent! Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress! Morgan Freeman is also great!

6 May 2023,Somewhere in the middle of nowhere,"A film that has won 4 Oscars and more than 150 nominations or other film awards. In this movie, Clint Eastwood once again shows his ability and love for cinema in the best way. Many fans and experts consider this movie to be his best movie. The film is excellent in directing, especially the use of light in the film is done in the best way. Therefore, filming is also exemplary. The film won 4 Oscars for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor. The film has no expiration date and remains in the historical memory of cinema lovers. A strong drama far from any clichés that prompts the audience to think about the meaning of life. Life is a combination of defeats and victories. It is a mixture of bitterness and sweetness, but it is the result of a person's efforts and fighting to achieve his dreams. Death is not an important thing and all people die in their daily life. In this inner struggle, he goes somewhere in the middle of nowhere in order to win this fight. In the final scenes in the hospital, where Frankie disconnects the air tube from Maggie, the bright shadows of Frankie and Maggie's faces remain and will remain in the mind. In the end, it should be said that Hilary Swank's stunning performance was reminiscent of ""Boys Don't Cry"" and she should be praised. Morgan Freeman is amazing and deservedly deserved an Oscar for this movie.",

Little by little the oxygen leaves your body, slowly but surely you're dying, you might not notice it in the beginning, but as soon as the ending comes and you take that last deep breath, KO! You are out for the count.. Million Dollar Baby Is about a young female fighter (Swank) who basically has nothing to live for.. her only escape is boxing, where she meets an old Trainer (Eastwood) and his retired boxing friend (Freeman). The way this story unfolds is utterly unpredictable, do not, I repeat, Do Not try to predict the ending, it isn't your typical Hollywood ending.. After the credits I found myself Crying! I mean, I'm a sensitive guy as it is, but this really depressed me, I even regressed into an old depression I once had, and I started thinking very negative thoughts of death.. This movie will make a sympathetic and Unstable person kill themselves. it was the saddest thing that I've seen in a long time, I felt sooo much for this movie that it's ridiculous.. any movie that has an impact like this on me, I have the give it at least an 8.5/10, but to round it off, I've already Voted 9/10, because it's closer to a 9 than an 8,No 10 because nothing is perfect! Best Movie of 2004 without a Doubt, well, at least until I see the movie ""Sideways""..",9
8 April 2017,Brilliant,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

5 January 2007,A Masterpiece,"Masterpiece. That was the M word that Roger Ebert used to describe this superlative piece of cinema is his much lauded 2004 review. Whether or not you agree with his integrity as film critic, it remains an outstanding film. Since then, it went on to win the much deserved Academy Award for best picture and director in a time when the awards are losing much of their credibility.

Clint Eastwood has structured a film that plays straight to the heart. It is honest, simple and thoughtful film-making, The story is tremendously moving, beautiful to watch, and to be drawn into the world of long-lost, fallen, and overdue fighters.

Written by Paul Haggis, who achieved success with Crash in the following year, it tells the tale of Maggie (Swank) who intends to make it in the often misunderstood world of female boxing. She has come from the wrong side of the trailer park, with only one aspiration in life - to box. Eastwood has once again paired up with Freeman, last seen together in their successful outing in Unforgiven. Along with Swank, the 3 main principals all manage career best performances thanks to Haggis' strong script and Eastwood's perceptive direction.

Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a conflicted man passed over by dreams, accomplishments and failures both personally and professionally. He seeks solace from God but in issues of boxing, he's a strict atheist. His daughter and apprentice-boxer have both abandoned him; he almost lost Eddie in a fight. Over prudently, he refuses to make the same mistake again. So he spends his days managing the rejects trying to box their way out of their miserable lives. He is played with such regret and loss by Eastwood which display the fragility of a man who achieved so much but at a great personal loss.

Eddie ""Scrap"" Dupris (Freeman with glass eye) narrates the film, serves as consciousness to Eastwood, and the observer in the gym and boxing ring to the viewer. His reputation as a former boxer as coached by Frankie is demonstrated through in gruff undertones, masked by a dogged, scar-faced demeanor. Freeman is a remainder of Frankie's bygone days, his success in the ring and as a painful memory of the ugly side of boxing. His life now amounts to nothing more at the gym than cleaning up the spit, beating up bullies and retiring to HBO in the gym where his dreams were almost realised.

Swank provides the turning point for the two men that ultimately brings them to desperate measures in the film's final act. She is for Frankie, the daughter he wishes he had; for Scrap, the opportunity to prove himself as a real fighter. With Frankie's coaching, she makes into the world of professional boxing, and more importantly, she has the opportunity to live her dream. Swank inhibits the role. As her own life story mirrors that of Maggie, she connects with her on all levels. She is defiant, rough, inspiring and raw. The challenges ahead of her are overwhelming in their adversity. But in her heartbreaking delivery, she knocks them out of the park.

The script by Haggis is heartfelt, honest and true. We smell the sweat and blood in a rawness that is both pungent and violent. Broken bones and bloody noses are part of road to victory. The paradoxical relationship between boxing an life is convincing and saddening.

The true star of the film is Eastwood's direction. He presents a story that is hopeful and inspiring but never panders to sentiment or pity. The gym is shot with the faded renaissance of the glory days; the boxing scenes are filmed with humour, energy and a sense of danger. The lighting is also quite amazing; giving us just what we require, allowing the viewer to formulate their own shapes. Sharp flashes of light and darkness suggest hope, mystery, danger, sadness and spirit.

Each turn of the story is a shot in the arm, a blow to the stomach. Things don't always go as planned but hopefully, we can experience a dream for just a few moments.A refreshing take on the rags-to-riches sporting story, it really transcends that genre. This film is about how we can achieve that dream worth fighting for, and go to all lengths to make it.A stunning film that shows us that even though there are many ways to tell a story; we can still be moved in such powerful ways.",10

10 January 2006,"Pretty good, but far from great","I'm not sure if this film's critical success stems more from a decline in film-making in general or Hollywood's love of Clint Eastwood. Heck, I love Eastwood. I also love Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman, they are huge talents. However, this was a formulaic movie, very predictable in parts. You can almost see the numbers as Eastwood paints them in. This does not diminish from the fact that you have solid actors working hard. However, some of the supporting cast strains credibility, no more so than the family of Maggie's, who plays bad as one-dimensional as you can. And some of the boxing material is also a stretch. A fairly unknown female boxer a year into her career is fighting for a million dollar purse? Don't think so. Perhaps my review would be more positive if this film was not so highly rated, but it is, and I am not sure why.

17 December 2014,Magnificent Movie !,"a great movie from Clint Eastwood , he is one of the best directors in terms of getting best performances from his actors, he pretty much always picks stories about underdogs and he never fails to show humanity in his characters and stories he is telling ,his movies always have a strong moral side no exception here too , acting in the movie is just perfect , Clint plays usual role for him but that is kind of roles he always plays and does them well ( i agree he does not have a great range but in his range he is the best) Hilary swank is just incredible, Morgan freeman is playing and narrating the movie which makes it more interesting to watch !!! won't talk much about the plot to not spoil tho its a 2005 movie . its not just a boxing movie it's about human relationship , loyalty about struggle of making hard choices, about what are we ready to sacrifice for achieving our dreams . of course there are some cons (mostly clichés that is not necessary a bad thing but i really don't like them ) Clint doesn't use camera tricks there is no special effects . there is just some quite piano playing here and there that he composed by himself this movie doesn't need all that , it punches you so hard you won't get up at least i didn't",10
13 November 2021,His exceptional masterpiece...,"Whilst I generally find Clint Eastwood's direction great, this is one example of him just delivering something extra which makes it an exceptional masterpiece. The other reason why this is a particular standout is because of the prominence of the musical score, which Eastwood also wrote. A real combination of the holy trinity of acting, direction & music writing which really sets this apart from his other films.

1 January 2005,This Ain't No Dike Boxer Flick--This Is Really Good,"I'm a little prejudiced because I enjoy watching Eastwood,Freeman, Swank,and Eastwood and Eastwood and Eastwood....but watching them all ""enteract"" together is an intense treat.Unlike other movies based on a boxer or athletic woman, Swank does'nt suddenly change into some tough jock-itching butchy bruiser.In other words shes ""femtuff"", only Matt Damon has a smile as honest as hers.She's so unassuming and easy to watch you forget she's acting. Freeman and Eastwood are effortless--just so enjoyable to watch you just can't get enough of them. The dialog is refreshing and solid scene to scene with no meaningless lengthy up-close nostril shots.The direction is not blatant but instead its seamless and hidden in full view.This is one of those rare movies that comes along that I want to buy not just rent.

24 March 2006,A Masterpice,"One of the best movies I have seen in the last 20 years. Rocky comparisons pale in that the acting here is Oscar worthy and deserved, while Rocky, great in it's own right, is more of a rah-rah everyman story. The heartbreak at the end is more sobering and insightful and handled brilliantly by Eastwood. The screenplay was flawless. Only thing I would have like to see was more revenge on the family and slime ball German Boxer. 10 out of 10..... Sideways was great, Baby was better..... Swank deserved all the accolades given. Eastwood handled this film like cat on a fence top, and didn't slip. The cast was excellent and supportive. Loved the dark and sparse lighting.

21 April 2005,"Girls, to learn to be a heart-breaker... watch this film.","{rant}

I'm certain I'm not the only man who finds the main character of this film to be unbelievably winning, and the only movie character I've ever found myself actually falling for. God, that sounds lame. But apparently, it happens to guys as well, and it seems I'm not the only one. As me and my mates have discussed it, it boils down to this:

1) She doesn't try to be manipulative. She doesn't see herself as clever, as many women tend to. In stead, she does her best and gives her most, without regret. She doesn't try to sell herself with her ""interesting and quirky personality"", or push buttons. She wants to prove herself with achievement, actions. This is so incredibly rare, and stands out so much.

2) She is goodnatured. Not a mean streak in her.

3) Yeah, her being beautiful and feminine is a big part of it. But, though this is about the natural beauty of her face as well, it has much more to do with the way she acts and moves. A practical kind of femininity. Low on make-up, focusing very little on facial perfection, and in stead on fitness - which almost any of you can achieve - and feminine attitude - NOT to be confused with an attitude of weakness, as is too often the case. She's very respectful, but sure as hell not subservient.

* This is turning into a bit of a rant, heh. But, seriously - if I get to just one female out there, it's worth it. I know that you young and brainwashed minds are oozing about out there, so listen up: the main character of this movie summarizes what I so often hear men agree that they are missing and searching for. Take those other role models out there, the pretty and weak and clever and dependant ones, and ****'em. They get attention, but of the short-lived and mean kind. In stead, be just half of what this girl is... and the worthwhile ones will single you out.

Another amazing thing about this girl is that she would never excuse not bothering the effort by saying that it's ""too late"" to begin.

22 January 2005,Great movie-whatever your politics,"Just saw Million Dollar Baby and thought it was an above average movie and would recommend it to anyone if for no other reason than Morgan Freeman, my favorite actor, is in it. As to the ludicrous comment about Michael Medved, implying he's a closed-minded bigot because he panned the movie, well-not a very open-minded thing to say, was it. There are people in this country who really have to come to terms with the fact that their side lost the election and stop seeing life in blue state-red state dichotomies. How someone's voting habits would affect what they think of a movie, unless it is an undisguised hit piece like Fahrenheit 911, is a little beyond me but I guess there are some people that see political motivations in everything. The election is over-get over it.

16 July 2023,One of the great films of the 21st century.,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a cinematic masterpiece directed and starring Clint Eastwood, who also co-produced the film. Released in 2004, the movie is a sports drama that captivated both audiences and critics with its compelling story and exceptional performances.

The plot revolves around Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, brilliantly portrayed by Hilary Swank, a determined waitress with dreams of becoming a professional boxer. She seeks the help of Frankie Dunn, a grumpy boxing trainer played by Clint Eastwood, who initially refuses to train her due to prejudice against women in the sport. However, with Maggie's persistence and the assistance of Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, played by Morgan Freeman, Frankie agrees to train her.

The film depicts Maggie's journey in the world of boxing, showcasing her victories and challenges as she rises in the amateur women's division. The relationship between Maggie and Frankie is delicately and touchingly portrayed as she becomes a true daughter to him. The chemistry between Swank and Eastwood is evident on screen, providing moments of tenderness and emotional connection.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is skillfully directed by Clint Eastwood, who captures the essence of the story with sensitivity and intensity. His solid direction keeps the audience immersed in the narrative and conveys the emotion of the boxing matches in a visceral manner. The cinematography is equally impressive, with well-choreographed action sequences that convey the brutality and excitement of the sport.

In addition to the standout performances by Swank and Eastwood, Morgan Freeman delivers a remarkable portrayal as Eddie, Frankie's friend and assistant. His off-screen narration guides the story in an engaging manner, adding an additional layer of depth to the film.

""Million Dollar Baby"" received critical acclaim and performed admirably at the box office. The film garnered seven Oscar nominations, winning four, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress for Hilary Swank, and Best Supporting Actor for Morgan Freeman. These awards are a testament to the exceptional quality of the film, which continues to be praised as one of the best movies of recent decades.

In summary, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a powerful and moving film that delves into the world of boxing to explore universal themes such as sacrifice, determination, and redemption. With exceptional performances, skillful direction, and a gripping story, this film stands as a landmark in contemporary cinema. It is a masterpiece that deserves to be appreciated and remembered as one of the great films of the 21st century.",10
27 November 2006,Strong and solid. 8 / 10.,"When the Oscars rolled around, I had seen 'The Aviator' and was rooting for Martin Scorsese to finally win an Oscar. Instead, as your probably know, Eastwood won his second directing Oscar and so it took me a while to watch this film.

Not that I ever expected it to be bad. I enjoyed 'Mystic River' and everyone is talking about Clint's new creative surge in his old age. If he keeps on making movies like 'Mystic' and 'Million,' I just might forgive him for 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' one day. :)

If you haven't seen this movie, you've probably heard some general offhand comments about it.

1) It's very moving. 2) The ending is not what you expect. 3) Eastwood dusts off his acting muscles and turns it up.

Well it is moving. The last part takes a different turn and hits you in the stomach. Some may feel the ending is overly manipulative but I was able to get past it. The movie hinges on Maggie (Swank) and Frank's (Eastwood) interaction. As the movie draws to a close you really get sucked in as the story drives towards the grand finale.

The movie has boxing but is mainly about characters. Three people feeling the sands of time slipping through the hourglass for each of them and handling it in different ways. Some scenes - Frank in church, Dupris' (Freeman) 'people die every day' speech - really stick in your memory and heart. Everything about this film - the actors (Swank especially), the pacing, the script and the dialogue - float like a butterfly yet sting like a bee. This film is a wonderful examination of how glory and failure are often a heartbeat away from each other. Such is sport. Such is life.

And just one small comment. If you're holding back in seeing this film because you've heard some feminist grumblings, then you don't really have anything to fear. I can see why some are a bit annoyed but the movie is strong, respectful and emotionally mature.",8

3 March 2005,A million dollar movie from a million dollar director.,"It's tough to talk about this movie without giving away some things that would ruin it, but one thing is for certain, it's NOT absolutely NOT what you're seeing advertised by Warner Bros. in the theaters. No, it's not a story about boxing, it's not an action film with Clint Eastwood, and it's not a thriller.

It has elements of all of the above, but this film that is directed and stars Clint Eastwood is perhaps his most emotional, most mature, most heart-felt film of his career. Just before I went to go see the movie last week, I was on the phone with Roger Ebert who predicts that it will sweep the Oscar nominations and could possibly be the only film with double-digit nominations this year. He may be right. If that's not enough of an endorsement for you, the perhaps this delicate explanation of the film will suffice.

Swank is enthusiastic, overzealous and passionate in this role. She chomps into the part like a champion, and she does more than sweat to make this part believable every step of the way.

Eastwood tries to avoid her interest in boxing, and her yearning for him to manage her, so he shuffles her off to Eddie, who gives her tips about how to train.

Not wanting to give anything at all away, some things happen that make everyone's life change drastically, and the film takes a totally unexpected direction from the first third of the movie.

That being said, the third act of the film is perhaps the weakest because it lacks the dramatic punch of some of the earlier scenes. It's still dramatic, it's still tender and surprising, but for some reason it's the least satisfying in the film. It gets slow, schmaltzy and somewhat cliché, but hey, it's a movie.

Eastwood no longer needs to prove himself as a director, and after last year's ""Mystic River"" (which won Sean Penn and Tim Robbins a best actor and supporting actor nod) he has proved he can direct well. Rarely does a director like to act in his own movies, though, so seeing him do both is an exception.

7/10.",
9 July 2005,"Hopefully Clint ""likes the smell too much""","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",

21 March 2008,Great Movie!!,"WOW!! I absolutely LOVED this movie!! It deserved to win the Oscar all the way, and it did. Hillary Swank And Clint Eastwood were UNBELIEVABLE! I usually don't like movies like this, but I just couldn't believe my eyes. It is hands down one of the best movies ever made. It deserves a perfect 10 out of 10. The ending is so emotional. She had that girl cold!! If it wasn't for that punch. Every movie lover on earth has to see this movie, because you'll LOVE it!!! It's just amazing. See it, you wont regret it!!! Another thing that is great about is that is has just the perfect amount of boxing scenes. It didn't go overboard on the boxing scenes and it didn't go over board on the boring scenes. In fact, in my opinion there were no ""boring"" scenes. If it's a night were your craving to see a movie, rent this ""Best Picture"" movie. It is certainly a ""Million Dollar Movie""!

2 February 2009,A million dollar effort,"I saw two Clint Eastwood movies. Gran Torino at the theater and MILLION DOLLAR BABY on DVD. I already talked about how much I liked Gran Torino.

In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, writers F.X. Toole and Paul Haggis have delivered a hard hitting and powerful screenplay. It is a very touching subject matter that constantly pulls at your heart strings.

And it can only do so if it were directed with great sensitivity. Eastwood again approaches his material meticulously and methodically, like a true artist.

His actors Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself, are exceptional in this movie. Swank deserves all of the accolades that she has gotten and more. I found her totally believable. Freeman has proved that he never hits a false note whenever he is acting on the screen. The supporting cast is pretty good also.",8
7 February 2005,not a great film by any means (such hype!!),"First off, this is a good film, but not a great film. And it does not at all merit the amount of hoopla and attention that it's been getting. I don't know why it has received as much attention as it has. Probably because of its director Clint Eastwood who always garners the spotlight in any project he's involved in.

But this film is rather shallow. It doesn't get deep at all. And many of the scenes are contrived. And if you've ever written a screenplay before, you can see where certain sequences were put in to purposely add tension or conflict but it's contrived and does not feel natural. For example, the minor character, Danger, was obviously an artificial add-on to give the very sparse film a few more interesting characters to fill in the backdrop but he's nothing new or original or even genuine. And he was only necessary to create the subplot which had Morgan Freeman punch the living daylights out of a ""punk"" boxer who if he had been seriously interested in pursuing a career in boxing would not have picked a fight with such a mediocre athlete. That's just one example.

Secondly, any film that has narration to it must be held suspect. And Morgan Freeman's narration added NOTHING to the story. If you were to see this film without any narration whatsoever, you would have come away with the same reaction you did with the narration. It was entirely superfluous and unnecessary and is BAD FILM MAKING.

Thirdly, Hilary Swank's parents were flatly drawn. Her mother expressed no inner conflict about who she was and just wanting the money made her very contemptible and as a result not interesting! You just hate her. But so what?? Then it becomes a sob fest between Clint Eastwood and Swank and that grows tiresome, BORING, and one long weeping Hallmark card.

This is film is good but not great and doesn't at all deserve the encomiums bestowed upon it by film critics who so desperately need to find SOME KIND of film to praise during an otherwise very poor year for film (2004, that is). Always remember folks, conflict is what drives a movie forward. Conflict!! And in Million Dollar Baby there wasn't nearly enough of it and what there was of it was very contrived.

Do yourself a favor and rent this one but don't pay $10 to see it. It's not worth it.",
3 April 2005,A Movie to Admire More Than To Love,"Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie. It is a character study. Now Rocky was a boxing movie. A poor young kid with ""heart"" gets a shot at the title, becomes a contender and triumphs over all the odds. Rocky's journey to triumph was the whole point of the exercise and that is what makes the film a boxing movie. Baby on the other hand, while steeped in boxing and its milieu, doesn't care about winning or being a contender. What it cares about are the people who live with the sport and how this world affects them, their attitudes and their actions.

Frankie Dunn is a boxing promoter. He's a tough old geezer and one of the best in his field. His one flaw is a serious drawback in his line of work. He doesn't like to see his fighters get hurt. Frankie's life is an endless cycle of developing young fighters only to be abandoned when he refuses to take them to the next level out of fear for their safety. One day Maggie Fitzgerald wanders into his gym. She's a youngish woman who wants to be a boxer. No, she wants to be a winner and she is more than willing to do whatever it takes to become one. Despite his years, his experience and his distaste for training a ""girly"" Frankie is no match for Maggie's tenacity and soon finds himself with a determined protégé who begins her swift rise to the top. This is only part of the story however. Events occur that test these two in ways far crueler than the force of a heavyweight's punch.

It has to be said that neither Hilary Swank nor Morgan Freeman are overly believable in their roles. Of the three leads only Eastwood looks likes he could spend his days in a dingy old gym. The spindly Swank is unconvincing as a power puncher and Freeman comes across like a slumming PhD. This is an instance, however, where suspension of disbelief pays off in the long run. A little loss of feasibility buys you two great performances. Maggie is a woman whose tough exterior hides a tougher interior wrapped around a will of iron. This is both her triumph and her tragedy. Swank captures these qualities in a natural, loose jointed performance that manages to make this rough customer appealing. Morgan Freeman is an actor who can steal a scene with just a look or turn of phrase. Here he's called upon to act as narrator and observer of human tragedy. He does so with dry objectivity leavened with a hint of bemused sorrow. As Frankie Eastwood is excellent as a man whose job and background conspire against his compassionate nature. The rasp of his voice sounds like a soul tearing itself apart.

Million Dollar Baby is not an easy movie to like. It takes two people who are the sum of their experiences and needs and rubs them together under horrendously stressful situations. It is like a case study, showing a little human truth as the film makers see it. If you approach it on those terms you will find Baby a worthwhile investment. You will, however, find yourself admiring the accomplishment more than loving the experience.",9

26 December 2004,The Best movie I have EVER seen...by far,"This movie was perfect...it included all of the necessary emotions of a human being...it makes one laugh, cry, feel inspired, have sympathy...it was perfect.

This movie should be awarded all of the Oscars it is nominated for. It by far deserves them, and Hilary Swank was phenomenal, along with Eastwood and Freeman.

I see no flaws in this movie. It is absolutely brilliant. A beautiful film that everyone should see...i cant understand why anyone would feel differently.

There were some aspects of the movie that couldn't necessarily happen in reality, but that is besides the point. It can in no way spoil the movie...i went in with no expectations, maybe thats why i loved it so much...it was amazing.

20 April 2006,What an excellent directing!!!,"Clint Eastwood is better than ever in front of the camera and behind the camera. The start of this movie was marvelous, short sentences, the atmosphere, and the storyteller, his voice was like straight from your favorite grandfather. this story is a different story and a brave movie from Clint Eastwood. There was two different thing in this movie (from my eye). The first was that dirty boxing box, the dark boxing gym and that little word-fight between old veterans, with a beautiful music. The second was the nights and days in hospital, with no sound but the sound of machines around poor Maggie. I admire the attitude of Maggie Fitzgerald. And I admire that Frankie Dunn was ready to put poison in that little girl's vein, which he really admired, I think most (after that girl he fell in love years ago) of his long-lasting life. I thank him, Hilary Swank and my favorite grandfather Morgan Freeman!!!

17 April 2016,This is Eastwood's masterpiece.,"Clint Eastwood's beautiful film tells the simple story of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), two old friends who run a boxing gym together, and the impact that Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) has on both their lives. Eastwood allows his characters centre stage, trusting in a marvellous script by Paul Haggis (based on stories by FX Toole) and the tremendous work of his players. The result is a wonderfully unfussy and affecting tale of people who feel as real as you or I, each line and expression ringing as true as anything we have seen on film.

Eastwood and Freeman use every single line to wonderful and curmudgeonly effect, portraying a deep friendship borne out of shared experiences and disappointments. Maggie is set on Frankie being her trainer and manager but he resists, unwilling to train a girl. Eddie sees something in Maggie, and encourages Frankie to train her. Slowly, Maggie's determination wins an unwilling Frankie over. Watching their friendship take root and blossom draws us deeper into the story, with the malcontented Frankie slowly warming to his new, if unwanted, charge. These three characters are the heart of the movie, and it's a film with a seriously huge heart.

Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won Oscars for their roles, and Eastwood won an Oscar for his direction, with the film winning Best Picture. However, Eastwood the actor has never been better. All three give beautifully pitched performances, and Eastwood the director captures them perfectly.

There's fine support work too from Jay Baruchel as Danger Barch, who dreams of being a world champion and Margo Martindale as Maggie's mother.

It's a story to make you laugh, it's a story to make you cheer, and it's a story to make you cry. This is Eastwood's masterpiece and one of my favourite films of all time. It's emotionally challenging, but I urge you to watch it.",10
27 February 2007,Masterpiece,"For a couple of days i saw the movie million dollar baby. At first i thought it is an usual boxing film but after i seen that movie i was really touched and surprised. I also asked me why i have this movie never seen before. The story about Maggie's way to her top is brilliant filmed. The actors plays her rolls perfectly.

One Oscar for the casting ;) Clint Eastwood shows that he is always be able to make masterpieces. Please Mr. Eastwood, wee need more such films.

The end is shocking how could life be.

This movie is one of few where you get touchingly, for sure. Because by no other film i watched in the cinema all people sitting noiseless in her seats and watch the final credits.

From me 10 of 10 points

20 February 2005,Very GOOD movie,"The story of this movie was well-done, but the acting is what carried it. Morgan Freeman was PERFECT in this film. Hillary Swank did a pretty good job in the female lead, and Clint Eastwood was great as the trainer (would've been interesting to see someone with a little more darkness, though, like a Tommy Lee Jones).

However, the story was a bit predictable, especially if you have heard just a little bit of the plot or a hint of how it ends. I don't think this is Best Picture material (I'd give that nod to Sideways, because the story and the ensemble were so tight, so believable), but I'd recommend seeing it in the theaters. 8/10 stars.

7 June 2005,"Great acting, strange emphasis (spoilers within)","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004.

8 January 2006,Doesn't hit the hype.,"I just saw Million Dollar Baby on HBO last night and I must say it doesn't live up to the hype. Is it a good movie? Definitely an achievement for Clint, but it is not one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is certainly superb, I can't deny that. If you want to be incredibly sad and hurt, this is the movie for you though. It is a tear jerker for sure but where's the creativity? Sure it's interesting but movies are supposed to innovative and creative as well as entertaining. This movie just goes for gritty drama and relies way to much on it's actors to make it. A movie must have more than a line up of great actors to make it great. While the premise touches the heart and then rips depression into your heart, it doesn't have the qualities to be the best of all time. It's just missing that certain creativity to stand out. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Taxi Drive or the Godfather or A Clockwork Orange, this movie will be forgotten with the rest of the Oscar winning dramas. While a good movie, doesn't fulfill the hype, and I found myself sadder at the end of My Dog Skip than this one. 6/10 for acting.

6 December 2005,The greatest movie ever made,"It is the masterpiece of Clint Eastwood because he combined the passion with faith and that is absolutely awesome.

The performance of Hilary Swank it is credible and beautiful.

Morgan Freeman proved that he has the potential and experience to perform that kind of role.

The directing of Eastwood is perfect and the reaction of that is the academy awards the movie won.

In other words, there are no reasons to think that this is a bad movie. I do not know more words in English to fill the ten lines that are obligatory. I just want to say that you HAVE to see this movie.",10
10 February 2005,Very Good Movie,"I have always liked Clint Eastwood. I grew up as a kid watching his so called Western Spaghetti series and then onto the Dirty Harry series. I only relished that this man could act in the movie, 'Bridges of Madison County'. Well, he was a good actor but before that I was more interested in his perfectly delivered punchlines and him grounding bad guys to the ground. 'Million Dollar Baby' is literally about two old men in their twilight years - Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman and the relationship between them, so often revealed by their ruthless dry humour, tells the story of the bond of friendship.... and NEED for each other. Hilary Swank is more of an intrusion into their perfectly balanced world of calm and routine. The whole story takes on an incredible 'timeline' of a time within a time - the superimposition of pace and excitement of Hilary Swank and the fights onto the mundane and dull backdrop of Eastwood's gym. A really fantastic movie. A movie about unusual courage. A movie about honour and respect. And above all, a movie about love.

4 February 2005,"I enjoyed Clint Eastwood's fable, but had some reservations","Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film not so much about boxing but one about a boxer. Hilary Swank plays Maggie, an inept fighter with a lot of heart and ambition, but her gender leaves her at a training disadvantage. This fact is most true with Frankie, played with a crusty soulful mourn by director Clint Eastwood. He will not train a girl, never has and never will. The movie never makes it completely clear why Maggie has chosen Frankie, but that seems beside the point.

There is a lot of boxing in ""Million Dollar Baby."" More so than in ""Girlfight,"" ""Raging Bull,"" or possibly even the ""Rocky"" films. I have never been a boxing fan and did not start while viewing this film. Though the sport disinterests me, the rise of Maggie's abilities struck as impressive. She comes from a small town but travels to Frankie's gym to strike it big.

Frankie, an ex-fighter much closer to the end of his training career than the beginning, cannot bring himself to take a stab at a high-profile duel even with his most talented fighter. When he leaves Frankie for greener pastures, Frankie decides then to take on the girl who cannot hit the punching bag correctly and doesn't have enough money to spend on a speed bag.

The film's narration is threaded by the great, vital voice of Morgan Freeman, who helps out and lives in Frankie's gym. It is he, an ex-boxer as well, who first sees Maggie's raw talent and heart. That is the stem to this flower, how it blooms is up to the viewer to experience on their own unmolested by the words on this page.

. The almost unanimous love ""Million Dollar Baby"" has appreciated from critics leaves me wondering a few things. Paul Haggis' script follows many of the same routes accessed by films of the past. Frankie and Maggie's relationship follows a well documented formula; Freeman's narration is well sounding but its service as a crutch to move the story along is apparent early on; the film's final third, which houses its most brilliant scenes, ignores the stories it nourished before. Freeman all but disappears and an odd sub-plot involving a scrawny boxer in Frankie's gym is underdeveloped and is never as satisfying as the filmmakers wish.

The acting is superb, especially noting Hilary Swank who has reprised her role as an actress who shines after appearing from nowhere. She gained this accolade after winning an Oscar for her heart-breaking role in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Clint Eastwood has improved with age and abandons much of his stoic image that has aided him in the past. Morgan Freeman is fine, but his role isn't as fleshed out as I would like and we have seen him much better in the past, including his previous pairing with Eastwood in ""Unforgiven.""

I seem apologetic to inform the reader that I liked Eastwood's film but did not love it. After all of the awards and critical acclaim, I cannot honestly jump up and down for ""M$B,"" as some have lovingly nicknamed it. My happiest moment was falling back in love with Hilary Swank, taking on another role not for the standard pretty Hollywood actress. Let us pray she never becomes one. *** out of ****",7

13 December 2005,This movie elicits every emotion imaginable,"This movie is definitely not a sugar coated portrayal of the sport, this script does not hold back! The characters are very well developed and Hillary Swank delivers an amazing performance. The movie goes much deeper than just the sport itself. It's a story in which each character posses their own inadequacies which they must learn to overcome. The boxing aspect simply symbolizes each individuals struggle to fight their way to the top and learning to ""roll with the punches"". Hillary Swank's character becomes the inspiration that seems to have been lost somewhere along the way. An excellent example of how what we put into the ""fight"" is more important than the outcome.

24 November 2005,The Best picture ever,"This is one of the most heart warming and Realistic pictures I have ever seen in my life. The Characters are real and you will fall in love with them all. Hillary Swank, is spell bounding, she was made for this part. This is a most see movie. Bring Kleenx though you will need it. Clint Eastwood, is as usual top of the game. Morgan Freeman, is just right on the money. If you see any movie see this one, I promise you it is worth it.

This movie looks at the heart that is in all of us. Someone that believes in something and is willing to give it all to achieve it. I respond to the movies because it touches my inter-most feelings, and thoughts about life and what we are all here for.

This movies (not really violent), has no profanity, no sexual overtones, it just honest straight forward life, no glamor, no glitz, no make believe, just and honest hard working persons trying to make a difference in this world. Believable, true can happen story.

The plot is excellent, it describes the characters so that you really get to know them. It is not long drawn out plot that is hard to understand or figure out. this movie is right on the money of showing true life, the real struggles a person endures.

I cannot say enough about this picture, I don't want to give away any clues about the movies, you most see this movie for yourself.",10
6 December 2005,Pure Genius,"This is not so much a review of just the excellence of the film but also of the DVD extras that come if you purchase the DVD special edition.

Not only is Million Dollar Baby one of the greats of film, the DVD extras disc is one of the best extras discs which I have seen. Why? Well unlike Peter Jackson's ""Rings"" epic's extra features, the extras with this DVD don't seek the average moviegoer to understand the concept of storyboarding, nor to be interested in the minutiae of film making. As meritorious as the compilers of the ""Rings"" DVDs may have been, they could learn much from those who compiled Million Dollar Baby's extras video. We see interviews with not only the major performers in the cast (Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank) but also other segments feature the minor but quite influential characters and one other segment features the producer and also the writer of the screenplay.

The film itself? Absolute brilliance. I first loved Eastwood's direction in a passionate sense after seeing Unforgiven. Gone are the panoramic shots which were characteristic of Unforgiven and The Bridges of Madison County. The camera adopts the claustrophobia of the gym and the hospital ward for much of this film and it succeeds wonderfully. Here is a film that well and truly deserved the Academy Awards which it secured. The plot? Why bother? A superb piece of film-making is a superb piece of film-making.

See Million Dollar Baby.",10
23 April 2006,"We all know girls can fight, but Million Dollar Baby gives the one-two punch into that subject.","One of the best films of recent years, Million Dollar Baby tells a simple story so heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who trains boxers has been through tough times in his life and it has influenced him to become the man he is  rough, frustrated, and broken. One day he meets Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a determined woman in her thirties who wants to make herself a boxer and wants Frankie to train her. At first, Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but when his old friend Eddie (Morgan Freeman) encourages Frankie to take on Maggie and train her, the two form an inevitable bond and a wonderful friendship.

The best thing about Million Dollar Baby is that it is simply told. Paul Haggis (by recent Crash fame) does a good job with the screenplay without making it sound too phony at times. The dialogue seemed real even with its solid simplicity. The characters are very well developed and I think one of the best things you can do to a character in film is to make the audience feel sympathy for him/her. In this case, the three characters of this film are introduced then we learn a little about them. Maggie is a local waitress who takes home customer leftovers and chew on them as dinner like a dog. Her family doesn't appreciate anything she does Frankie, who attends church for the past few decades goes there and doesn't really know what draws him there. Eddie, an ex-boxer, is blind in one eye and cleans the gym daily and reads newspapers frequently. We feel some sympathy for these characters and that is what makes the film work.

The performances are brilliant. Hilary Swank is amazing here. We see her eyes look at Frankie like a child as she eagerly learns how to box. In the boxing ring, her eyes are shining with determination and great strength, knowing that she has got her chance. Clint Eastwood (who also directed the film) is also good here too, making his character like some tough-guy but hey  we know the guy's got a soft-side too. Morgan Freeman is great, filling in his classic ""supporting role"" style.

The flaw of Million Dollar Baby comes in the last 40 minutes or so. The last 40 minutes seem to go by too slowly. Even though the heartbreaking ending was bound to come, I thought the emotional development in those last scenes seemed slow and sometimes bland. It shows again what we already know and already saw. It was pretty much for me, ""Been there, done that."" The last few seconds were quite powerful, but what came before that was too slow for me to handle.",9
27 December 2005,Cracking Film it is.,"A brilliant piece of work by Eastwood and great acting by Hilary swank. Morgan Freeman needs no definition and is superb again. I have learnt few things from this movie. Strong dedication and willingness to achieve your goals will take you right there even if you have already lost some ground.

This movie is simple and brilliant piece of work. The storyline is inspiring and reveals certain important facts about life. Some People are born to lead because they believe in something what they can only imagine about.

Thank You.

27 February 2005,Training for live,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award.

8 January 2006,A truly excellent movie!!,"Clint Eastwood really plays his part in his role great. The movie was great and I will watch it again and again. It is almost like the modern day Rocky movie except with an awful ending. I almost cried at the end, but you all have to realize what you would want if you were in the fighter's situation at the end of the movie. This movie will really make you think about your life and make you realize how fast something bad could happen. Anyway, if you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was Maggie's family. They were so ungrateful that it made me mad and I wasn't even in the movie. Maggie was out there trying to be the best she could be, and they were so ungrateful for the things she was doing to try to help them. I really believe that they were my family, I would have turned my back on them just because of that reason. Either way, I still give this movie a 10 and would give it an 11 if allowed.

10 June 2018,Phenomenal,"This movie is superb. There are very few flaws. The acting is great, with Hillary Swank absolutely shining in the lead, well deserving of her Academy Award for Best Actress.

The only thing that always bugged me is the explanation behind the knock-out ""mechanism"", which is simply incorrect.

The 1/10 ratings are moronic. Don't pay attention to them. People don't know film if they think this deserves 1/10.

18 November 2006,Terrible,"I will never understand how this movie could beat out The Aviator, Sideways, or Finding Neverland for Best Picture. And once again Martin Scorsese got snubbed at the Oscar's losing out to Clint Eastwood, who directed this style-less picture. This movie is so cliché and all of the tear-jerker nonsense feels very artificial. The word artificial, I think, sums up this movie very well. Clint Eastwood just isn't a very good director. I will say though, that Morgan Freeman is excellent in this picture. Although, if you want to see a great Freeman film, go and check out the Shawshank Redemption, where he lost out to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Another movie that is totally artificial.

7 February 2006,Wonderful,"This is one of the best film i've ever seen, congratulations to Eastwood for the great work. Maybe at the start you can think that is a feminine version of Rocky, but then you're gonna to be emotionated by this film. This is a film that everyone must see. And i think that someone don't feel something watching this film, he's not a human being. A mention also to the great performance of Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, without forgetting Hilary Swank. If you haven't seem it yet, do it! That's an order!In conclusion, this film has entered in the top 5 of my favourites films, and i'm sure that if you've watched it has been entered also in yours.

21 February 2005,Awful!,"I felt like I was watching the Jerry Springer show. Low class people, doing stupid things.

Why can't there be more movies that are beautiful and uplifting???

Instead we get gritty trash like this. If I wanted to look at dirty floors and walls I could have stayed home, or watched the news on television or programs like Cops.

This was a waste of money. The only reason this was nominated for awards is because of Clint Eastwood. However, I think he should stick to making Westerns.

I used to be a fan of his, but he has not done anything worth seeing in recent years.

Also the girl, Hillary Swank, seems to act the same in every movie she is in.

I do not recommend this film at all, but if you must watch it because of it's award status, then wait to see it on the small screen (your TV set), it would be a lot easier to take.",1

7 January 2023,"Unexpected, touching and so well made","Clint Eastwood genius. Dunno why I hadn't watched it earlier but that is one of the best films of all time.

2/3 of it was a classic boxing film but the last1/3 truly inspirational and just perfect in terms of emotional engagement. Loved seeing a rare film about a female and male father-2daughter type relationship where it's primarily about loyalty, dedication and love.

Beautiful ending and just hit me in so many unexpected ways.

Clint got the Oscar for direction and Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank deserved their Oscar's too...

The subtlety in character development is phenomenal. The boxing fights themselves were well shot. The characters all very likeable.",9
6 March 2006,Memory,"I can't add any more to the superlatives already voiced on this movie. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank. How much better does it get? What really caught me off guard was the expression placed on her robe . It has been many years since I have heard this but as a youngster I was quite familiar with it. After supper in our home we, the children, would have to do our homework right away. In the background my Mom would be on the piano and my Dad singing all sorts of tunes. It was their ""thing"" at the time since money was scarce and it was their relaxation and entertainment. One song was brought back the instant I heard this term mentioned in the movie and I almost ""shot right out of my seat with the wonderful flashback it gave me. My Dad always sang a tune called,""-- -------,Mo Chuisle, Mo Chree"".It speaks to me of family in a personal sense and movie-making a la Eastwood speaks of ""family"" in so many ways as well.What a bonus! Cheers! Ron.

19 March 2005,Tries too hard to be both drama and comedy,"I have really enjoyed a few of the movies that Clint Eastwood has directed, but this was not one of them.

The story overall was quite good, and could have presented the viewer with an interesting and involving story. Instead what I found was characters that did not seem real and a plot progression that didn't feel right. It was the details that didn't work for me. A few words and a few scenes here and there that just yanked me away from the movie, leaving me feeling no attachment at all to the characters.

I think that they went all out in the many comedic scenes, so that once they put those same characters into serious scenes, it felt like an adaptation of a comic book -- not very believable. I kept on thinking of the scenes in the first Spider-Man movie when he went to that fight, not very real, but fun to watch. I enjoyed the comedic and action side of Million Dollary Baby, but it left the dramatic side feeling pretty distant and surreal.

Surprisingly, I found my favourite character in the movie was not either of the two leads, but the secondary character ""Scraps"", who was played by Morgan Freeman. He felt far more real and believable than the others in this film.

My rating of this movie is 6/10.",6

15 May 2005,losing my time,"i went to see that film last night. After so many friends telling me they so cried, that the directing was classy and fantastic. And i went, because i still think Clint Eastwood is an important and good man of American cinema, even though i think that Hilary Swank is one of the most overrated actress but... I went. And i was bored from minute one. What with that ""wisdom"" we are supposed to listen to all the way through (Even though Morgan Freeman's voice is always a pleasure to listen to). What with the overacting of the leading woman. I didn't care at all about that soapy, television film story. I didn't care about that side story about the daughter. But i stayed. And i was a bit moved at the end. But then, i should stop to listen to my friends.

9 February 2006,"Good acting, bad story","This film challenged one of the biggest Hollywood clichés: That if you're talented, determined and hard working enough blah blah blah you'll become a millionaire within a record amount of time and then live happily ever after.

So sometimes s**t happens and people just have bad luck despite all of the above. Point taken.

But in busting one Hollywood cliché the film simply propagated another one: That you can't be happy without being rich and famous.

Life is not as black and white as that. Sure, poverty sucks, but it's not like the ONLY two options in life are either being dirty rich or filthy poor (or whichever way around).

Maggie's desperate all-or-nothing philosophy really irritated me. This film seems to hint that violence is the only way out of poverty. But violence is NOT a way out of poverty, EDUCATION is. Had she been as dogged about learning a trade as she had been about becoming a champion, she would have earned a qualification several times over by the end of the film and been able to lead quite a comfortable middle class life. Boxing may have been her vocation but it's not a secret that to earn a decent living from this sport you run a high risk of becoming a brain damaged wreck.",5
28 March 2005,Gruff ain't enough..,"Throughout most of his career Clint Eastwood has assumed the role of a protecting angel, sometimes deadly, often sullen or glaring, always with a swollen, golden Irish heart not far from the surface. The Leone westerns (in one of which Lee Van Cleef even describes him as a ""guardian angel""), The Gauntlet,(shielding Sondra Locke), Heartbreak Hill and In The Line Of Fire all reinforce this subtle theme. In the same way as much of Scorsese's work deals with men who live with obsession, Eastwood's films often focus on men who feel obligated to protect others, and live with the pain of the consequences when they sometimes fail.

Million Dollar Baby is the story of an ingenue female boxer from the poorest levels of American society, and the relationship she develops with her trainer (Eastwood). No need to recapitulate the story, however in true Anthony Robbins/Frank Capra style she is carried to the heights of fame with, it seems, little else apart from determination and self-belief only to be tragically struck down at the height of her fame. Despite his initial grumpy reluctance to get involved, Eastwood takes her on and the dynamic eventually deepens to the point where Maggie (Hilary Swank) becomes the substitute daughter that Frankie (Eastwood) has lost. This is confirmed by the final revelation of Maggie's Gaelic boxing nickname ""My darling, my blood"", and the ultimate act of love that climaxes the film. Having failed once more to protect, the Eastwood character almost mythically retreats into a shadowy limbo, a Hadean nocturnal world of country inns and small diners that suggest the final resting place for all unsuccessful guardian angels.

I am inclined to think that the Academy voted Million Dollar Baby as best potential motion picture, as the finished version contains only about a frustrating thirty percent of what might have been achieved with further development of ideas. While Hilary Swank charms always with her wide-eyed vulnerability, the initial relationship is trite, as is the persisting underlying American self-delusion that all things are possible if one only believes in oneself. Even the comic-cuts character of 'Danger' fails to recognise his own limitations and returns to the gym at the end of the film for more ritualised humiliation. Plot and characterisation all show signs of unsteadiness - there is no exploration of the relationship between Eastwood and his daughter, for example, the 'success montage' is jerky and out of kilter with the rest of the film's pace, and the boxer's psychology is insufficiently examined. By the second half, the film's 'fighting Irish' undertones, Catholic confessions and soundtrack began to remind me of John Ford on a particularly maudlin day and struck this reviewer as outdated and contrivedly mawkish.

I have long been an admirer of Clint Eastwood's films and have watched them develop in depth and richness. Were it not for the existing hype, MDB could be enjoyed as a downbeat Rocky fable, even a female version of Every Which Way But Loose. However on this occasion it's hard to escape the feeling that 'Baby' is a lightweight story punching above its weight and ultimately failing to go the distance",

3 August 2005,Politically-correct piece of crap!,"Everything what I had to say about this piece of propaganda is already in my summary. I must add: I have never expected Clint Eastwood to direct and act in in a flick like this. I was in state of shock when the movie ended - and not for its plot, I assure you. I just couldn't believe it was made by this Clint Eastwood, not some other Clint Eastwood :-O Perhaps its highest time to retire, Mr. Eastwood, don't you think so? Let us remember you as fine, talented actor, that you still are, rather than a director of thick propaganda-laced politically correct flicks!

And what was so outstanding about Hillary Swank's acting to deserve an Oscar? I could've understand this choice had she been from a Jewish family, but since she is not... excuse me, but her acting wasn't any better than the acting of Spiderman's girlfriend (whatever her name was); hell, even Anette Bening was better than Swank in ""Being Julia"" (and she always stink)! Catalina Sandino Moreno was real Actress in a Leading Role for 2005 Oscars. Unfortunately her film and character weren't oh-so-politically-correct piece of {insert your favorite bad word here}... Oh well. We all know for quite some time that Academy Awards are what they are - free publicity stunts for the insiders, televised to (less and less every year) other countries...

2/10 (including 2 points for Clint Eastwood's role and acting)",
12 November 2005,"Sad, Sad,Sad","Not what you will expect. All of the characters' lives in this movie are so sad. Great performances by the actors. You can tell that the leading actress (Hillary Swank) worked hard to prepare for this movie. Morgan Freeman narrates the movie and he just has this voice that just captures every the very essence that is intended. I would not run out and buy this movie personally, renting it once will suffice, yet it is a good flick to watch at least once. Some movies are just to close to real life, in the sense that there is no fairy tale ending. It is too grim for me to sit through again. Oh, and I cannot forget mentioning Clint Eastwood, who is of course one of the most seasoned power actors of all time. In this movie he tries to keep a hard exterior, yet the whole time we can easily see his pain. Very real, very sad.

28 July 2006,Baby Is A Knock Out,"This movie is actually one of the best movies i have ever seen. I just watched it again tonight and I'm still in love with it. First off it is amazing how Hilary Swank became so fit to do this part, she plays the part like she was actually this person.

It was all about passion, determination, perseverance, dedication, desire, and work. It is a very inspirational movie because of all these aspects. Maggie (Swank) shows that no matter what anyone says if you work you'll achieve.

This personally motivated me to work a lot harder in my training. ""Play like your in first, train like your in second."" Even though Maggie was able to knock these girls out within 5 seconds of the first round she never quit training and practising. Great movie, the ending got a lot of heat saying it was bad but i don't think it could have been better. It was not corny which was surprising because most movies have these types of endings.

1 March 2005,"Again, Hollywood shows no low to it's depravity","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

30 January 2005,A movie like they USE TO make them! GREAT!,"I just saw ""Baby"" yesterday and I'm still half in a daze over the impact it made on me. The characters were excellently portrayed. So what if all of the actors cast for their parts have remained little changed from other similar roles? They may be typecast, but isn't it better to get actors with experience in their role situations than trying to get others to ADAPT to characters very UNLIKE their own personalities? Would you want the three main characters to be portrayed by Matt Damon, Eddie Murphey, and Kate Winslet? Could they ADAPT? Who cares if they could? The casting director did his job. The cast is perfect and the writing was right on the mark.

I am a boxing fan and I have been since my teenage days (I'm now 62) and I was impressed with the near accuracy of the films boxing sequences. Even the ending---which leaves many unanswered questions--was perfect.

I hope that the motion picture academy recognizes the brilliance of this film and bestows several Oscars to its participants.

ONE THING MORE:

I must confess that I haven't read ALL the comments made earlier regarding this film, but I suspect that few if any of the commentators noticed something I did about the movie.

It contained little or NO PROFANITY and little if any SMOKING! How great to realize that these are two ingredients we can do without--in the movies AND in our lives.

WHY DOES THE FILM INDUSTRY USE THE TERM ""contains ADULT language"" in its ratings? The term should be ""contains PROFANITY!"" NORMAL adults don't speak with profanity. People I care to associate with need not use profanity---even when they get EXCITED!! How do they manage to express their aggression without profanity, some of you may wonder. It CAN be done and IS done by most adults.

Is the lesson we want to teach youngsters---adults swear like crazy and that's O.K.?? Kids, you just wait until you are grown up and then YOU can turn into a real ADULT idiotic potty mouth who only knows seventeen words beyond ""Muttha fu----.""

Industry----use the phrase ""contains PROFANITY"" instead of ""adult language"" PLEASE!

Enough said--more than enough-- Clint, keep up the great movie-making. This one will be hard to beat.",

1 March 2005,Director Took A Dive,"This was a great movie almost right up to where it stank on fire!

30 seconds added to this film would have kept a great story from becoming a slap in the audience's face.

The plot twist in this film was so sloppy, it felt like the biggest slap in the face I ever got in a theater. And that includes puberty!

Characters that are so well defined and so passionate about their expertise will actually try to do their jobs. I'm still walking around in circles wondering what happened.

It's OK to have an agenda if you take us there. But don't leave that paragraph out! It was like for a second it became ""invasion of the Body Snatchers but then they came back...

I was so angry at this movie, I will NOT see another Eastwood film!",1

2 October 2015,Wow! and holy Cow,"You know, i have been putting off this title over and over again. It hit Netflix and i saw that Morgan ""god"" freeman was in it and thought why not. I figured i would turn it off after 20 min because i don't like boxing and didn't like raging bull. Rocky was fine but people hitting each other for sport.. No.

The movie started and i was hooked. Right from the beginning i knew it wasn't just about boxing. The Character progression was fantastic. The theme worked on so many levels. The movie really showed the good and bad about what the word ""family"" really means. The The last 3/4 of the movie had me 2 inches from the screen and almost in tears.

Just watch it. Wasn't what i expected and glad it wasn't. Loved it!!

2 April 2006,Stick to acting Clint...,"I suppose if Brittney Spears, or some other celeb were to write and direct a movie it would get the same rave reviews. Fact is, Clint Eastwood is a fair director but he isn't gifted beyond that. He's starred in some great films but his self directed films don't do very well. The story line in Million Dollar Baby had so many holes in it that it seemed like it was written scene by scene with not even bread crumbs to lead a viewer through the storyline. If not for the very controversial aspect of it (euthanasia, right to die)it would have faded just as quickly as some of his other flops (Bloodwork, True Crime, . I'm glad I waited until it was $1.99 to watch it because I lost interest about 40 minutes into it. Clint Eastwood needs to be directed because he's a good actor. He should leave the directing to those who are good at it.

19 August 2015,Only boxing movie to bring tears to this grown man,"I'm not a fan of women's boxing or women in fight sports at all. Yes, I'm that kind of traditionalist as*hole. Then it's an even greater testament to the greatness of Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, that they can make this dinosaur sit glued to the chair in a film about exactly that.

I think the reason this movie succeeds in such a highly charged theme is because it completely refrains from the kind of 'you go girl' feminism that has taken over a lot of films from Hollywood.

There is no ideology, sentimentality or gender politics in this film, only deep and real characters with real emotion and motivation and acting performances to match any in the history of film making. Swank, Clint and Freeman deliver outstanding performances and you can't help but feel and live their experiences.

It's a Greek tragedy which avoids all the Hollywood clichés. It's about knowing your place in the world and embracing your destiny with courage, not running from it. A true masterpiece.",9

14 February 2005,Very underwhelming,"I saw this movie yesterday after seeing all the acclaim and boy, was I disappointed. There are many implausible plot lines, and frankly who needs another boxing movie about man/woman reaching glory by winning boxing matches. Many reviews stated that the boxing theme was minor but I didn't find that to be the case at all. After Rocky and Raging Bull, the turf has been covered. I thought that Eastwood eclipsed with Mystic River and this was a letdown, same with Hillary Swank who was more interesting in Boys Don't Cry. I never saw Los Angeles come off more like a rural hick town than in this film. There is this relationship with Eastwood and his daughter that is mystery estrangement and it is never resolved. The pacing was also very slow. This has to be the weakest of the Oscar contenders this year.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",7

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald.

31 January 2005,"Warning! Warning! See at your own risk, guys...","It took me a while to figure out, plowing through the bloody macho fight stuff and all, but then it hit me. THIS IS ACTUALLY A CHICK FLICK!!! Brilliant move by Eastwood. Might win him an Oscar. Not that it didn't have it's good moments. It was most engrossing when Clint was teaching the babe the finer points of boxing. But it had a lot of plot holes and weaknesses in character development. One example of many: the babe is a gung ho boxer all of a sudden at 31. OK, so what the HELL was she doing for 16 years since she hit puberty? We have no clue. Not a bad movie, but had a ""built by committee"" feel to it and REALLY tries to squeeze out every tear it POSSIBLY can at the end.

21 April 2023,Masterful film!,"I confess. I didn't think I would like a movie about women's boxing. However, Million Dollar Baby managed to keep me glued to the TV until the end. End is the right word, even if it's a finale that I would have wanted to be different. I would have wanted a more typical American movie ending and less of a Greek tragedy. But that's not how it turned out. And it's better that way. Boxing is just an excuse to tackle delicate themes such as life, death, and relationships. Great actors for an Oscar-worthy performance. Overall, a masterful film, one of those to be included in the list of the most beautiful films of all time.

4 February 2005,This picture is worth a million dollars,"Believe the hype about this movie. Eastwood has not only directed one of the finest movies to date, but he as well has shown incredibly deep emotion in his own character. Million Dollar Baby gives true insight to life lessons that go beyond the mere comedy or action that is in this picture (which does entertain). This is what the really good movies are about. This raw emotion is what gives people something to talk about afterward and will stay with you for awhile. Hilary Swank gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel her career, and Morgan Freeman continues to become the best supporting actor ever (see top 250: Unforgiven and Shawshank Redemption).

It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",6
21 February 2005,Depressing !!,"Why do they make movies about people you could not care less about, living depressing lives, in dirty buildings?

Why not make uplifting films about charismatic people, doing magical things, in beautiful settings.

I'm sorry, but I'll take Harry Potter, or ALW's Phantom of the Opera, or Shall We Dance, or Jurassic Park any day.

Movies should be Fun and Entertaining! If I want to be depressed, I'll watch the News on TV.

28 January 2006,MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a good movie --- not great --- but good,"I think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a good movie --- not great --- but good. There were many moments of the film that were outlandish - especially some of the boxing sequences. Some of them were as unrealistic as you'd find in a ROCKY sequel.

However, Swank and Freeman gave excellent performance and some of the dialogue was quite good. Eastwood, on the other hand, come across too bland at times. The last church scene, IMO, was were he was at his best. As for his directing, Eastwood did a good solid job.

The film does suffer from inconsistent pacing and some emotionally manipulative sequences.

All in all, I'd give the film a 7/10.

5 February 2005,One of the best .... but not the best,"Hello my friends.

The first thing what I go to say. It's the Million dollar Baby it's a wonderful drama. The acting is amazing: The middle blind man & ex-boxing Morgan's Freeman character is very sweet and clever, the boxing coach & depressive man Clint Eastwood character it's very realistic and clever too, and the girl boxing Hilary S. character it's excellent & lovely. The directing it's faster, and gets the point in the principal story, and don't get out of them. The photography it's perfect and beautiful, the illumination it's the comic style, Clint Eastwood play with the shadows and the lights very well. The music not bad, simple but But it goes identically to the history.

But, yes there is a but ..... The story are simple, Million dollar baby it's one of the best Clint Eastwood movies but it isn't the best movie of Clint Eastwood. Mystic river are more complex than M$B. It's a mix of styles & genres, and the final chapter are amazing it's a work of art.",10
19 July 2006,MILLIONTH Done Baby,"The tenth female boxing movie of the same theme! And in all honesty, it was Rocky 47.. only Mickey was back from the dead as Clint. The only distinguishing quality about this movie was the ending! An ending in and of itself is not enough reason to say something is original. I can't just redo the Godfather and take out Pacino killing Cazale.. (which would be a larger distinguishing factor than what we see in ""Millionth Done Baby"").. and call it Million Dollar Godfather. Then the ending tied to the theme of ""Women being strong too"" not only in a physical sense, but in an emotional sense. Wow.

I thought it relied too heavily on the idea of injust persecution. the million dollar baby herself is like a Christ entity who is motivated solely by good and finds persecution at the hands of everyone, and then has to die at the end.. and emotional spectacle.

17 September 2020,Emotional and thrilling,"An emotional story about passion, an unbreakable bond, and giving all you got for what you want. It's tragic in a bittersweet way. It's full of action, but also emotional and raw. You instantly fall in love with the characters. Amazing performances by Swank, Eastwood, and Freeman.

15 June 2005,A wonderful little movie with enough quirks to make it a near classic,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is as well acted and executed a movie as one will likely see. Clint Eastwood steals virtually every scene he appears in, and Hillary Swank is great as his sidekick. The story is simple, yet quirky, and Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast set up an appropriate mood of desperation. Although the remainder of this review will not be completely complimentary to the feature, I would recommend the movie to anyone wanting to see good cinema and an outstanding Clint Eastwood performance.

Now, it is time to put ""Million Dollar Baby"" into perspective. The film is simply not in the same league as the classic Paul Newman/Tom Cruise feature, ""The Color of Money"". Both movies have the making of a champion the central plot. However, ""The Color of Money"" is more fun, more realistic, and finally and oddly, more optimistic than ""Million Dollar Baby"". Tragedy and boxing always seem to go together. That has become cliché. Tom Cruise in ""The Color of Money"" is not a tragic character and strangely enough, neither is Paul Newman. Opening up the world of championship pool, and showing it for the joke it is, was far more entertaining and enlightening than yet another feature on the brutal and barely acceptable culture of boxing.

To conclude, I would recommend anyone who has seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" to view or review ""The Color of Money"" and come to your own conclusions on which story was better.",
3 March 2005,The Best Film of Eastwood's Long Career,"The first third of ""Million Dollar Baby"" plays out slow and indifferent. But through a series of poignant and insightful scenes midway through the film morphs into an emotional powerhouse. Traditionally, Eastwood was never able to construct great pieces of storytelling with great character acting. He only recently was able to assemble inspired pieces of narrative cinema with ""Blood Work"" and ""Mystic River"" but this film handily outshines them both. Pay attention to the back-story involving Eastwood's character's estranged relationship with his daughter and it amplifies the dramatic pull of his relationship with Swank's character. It's the best film Eastwood has ever been involved with. Ultimately, it's a must-see.

5 March 2005,Has both heart and legs,"For those who don't quite ""get"" women's boxing, let me recommend two books that might help. The first is Rene Denfeld's 1997 title Kill the Body, the Head Will Fall, a post-feminist critique. The second is a new book by Leah Hager Cohen (2005), Without Apology. Both books maintain an analytical and critical stance, while at the same time allowing readers the opportunity to ""get into the skin"" of those who are drawn to the sport. Our society's fear of (and consequent denial of) female aggression is symptomatic of a much deeper problem. Almost all psychologists and sociologists would agree that integrating our aggressive feelings and impulses is an important part in the development of human wholeness. The degree to which we deny this development to women is commensurate with the degree to which we deny them their full complement of humanity. The movie Million Dollar Baby provides a corrective, indeed wholesome model of a woman seeking just such wholeness and integration. The second issue (likely to draw more in the way of negative criticism) dealing with Frankie's mental torment when confronted with a life/death decision may seem a bit sanitized, but the pain of decision is well-portrayed, and the issue is one we have tried to duck as a society, as well. For those not afraid to consider alternative viewpoints, I would recommend the title Death and Dying in the very helpful Opposing Viewpoints series published by Greenhaven Press (2003).",10
20 July 2005,A movie with heart,"Million Dollar Baby is a boxing movie with a twist. It's a treat to see three great stars (Eastwood, Swank and Freeman) all hitting their marks. This has to be Clint Eastwood's greatest performance on screen and he directs with the level of excellence that we've come to expect. Hillary Swank proves that she deserves to be a 2 time Academy Award winner and gives an unforgettable performance. Morgan Freeman is basically himself, which is always a good thing and earned his long overdue Oscar. This is not so much a boxing movie about bravado, but it has as much heart as any sports movie ever made. This one will stay with you long after the closing credits. Not to be missed.

28 February 2005,What Am I Missing?,"Is there something I am missing? I liked Million Dollar Baby, but Best Actress Best Director and Best Picture? Are you fu cking with me? The Aviator was a fantastic cinematic experience, and Million Dollar Baby just wasn't. Even worse was that Martin Scorcese got blown off again, by somebody who already won and didn't deserve it. MDB's directing was just not even on the same level as The Aviator. The only awards I truly agreed with were Morgan Freeman's and Eternal Sunshine's Original Screenplay award. And the movie is in the Top 100 already. WHAT! I really enjoyed the movie, but it is being completely overblown. Anybody agree?

8 June 2014,My all time best...,"I am late on this but still wanted to do justice with the review of mine cos, yeah, it is close to my heart. I have been an avid lover of Clint Eastwood's movie but do believe- This is the Best.

Best ones are those wo make you sit throughout the journey and you say at the end- yep, he/she did a marvelous job, awesome etc. But, the toppers indulge you in the journey. Yes, that is the experience of this journey of Swank and Eastwood. The best of my life.

Hillary Swank is my fav cos of this act and do believe that this is her best till now. And about Eastwood, an immortal actor in Hollywood arena, set the benchmark for the cinema. Truly, the best of Clint Eastwood. It is the story of a dream who became reality, lived a small life and ended beautifully. The end signifies the beauty and the trail of a sweet journey but the End do also tells you why it is the right way of happening things-at least in this context.

It is a sweet and inspirational movie which will make you join its beautiful journey and do believe me, it is the journey of the lifetime. Flaw is not the word meant for this but the Love.

Do recommend this masterpiece to everybody in this world and beyond- might be in Roswell",10
23 March 2005,"Moving drama, but isn't it really two movies","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",8
23 March 2005,total shock,"I was not prepared for this movie! I wanted to see it only for the purpose to see a movie with such talented actors together! Hilary Swank was a big draw for me; to see how she faired amongst such greats as Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman! I was not disappointed as I could see she is definitely in their same league! Clint and Morgan were simply pro's acting with ease! But the movie took me from a quick surprise to shock! I had no idea where the movie would take me! I thought this was going to be a straight forward story line with no real surprises! I was surprised alright! I was stunned for hours and days later the movie stills resinates within me!

When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",

12 April 2006,"""Million Dollar Baby"" definitely on my Top Ten List.","""Million Dollar Baby,"" is an epic film directed by Clint Eastwood that has definitely sealed a spot in my ""Top Ten."" I, personally, am a Hillary Swank fan and she lives up to and excels her leading role as Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman coming from nothing to attempt to succeed in a mans sport that she loves. Maggie is working to live and then spends the rest of her time working out in the gym to become the best. This film is full of many different genres and feelings; drama, hope, despair, persistence, and even David vs. Goliath. Maggie isn't the youngest, the quickest, or the strongest, but what she lacks in skill, she compromises with her heart. So much heart, that the once stubborn Frankie Dunn, Clint Eastwood, agrees to become her trainer, even though she's a girl. Throughout the training and success of Maggie's career, they spark up a friendship as strong or even stronger than family. This is a great film and a must-see, it's amazing and has you rooting and leaving the theater with a want to better yourself and follow your dreams, despite the possibility of failure.

5 March 2005,"Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya, Hillary?","I am so amazed at how America is so in love with Clint Eastwood and his films. Mystic River was very good. Actually, far better than this one. But only Unforgiven was a true classic. Now, I know he's old and we think each film might be his last, but please, people, no need to heap praise upon anything he cranks out of a camera.

His performance is measured a craggy. Hillary is good, but not Oscar worthy, unless one gets an award for body morphing. Then, Anna Nicole Smith deserves one, too. All the supporting actors are two dimensional. The script is a patchwork from a book of short stories, and it feels like it. Whose perspective is the film supposed to be? I get two, sometimes three.

Don't get me wrong, there are good moments in the film and the cinematography is wonderful. It's just not the Best Picture of the Year.

28 November 2021,Heartbreaking & Beautiful,"A cinematic work of art. The saddest film I've ever seen, possibly. Clint is amazing opposite Morgan, and Hilary is just groundbreaking. I saw this film when I was 18 and it never left my psyche. In my opinion, it is a must-see. From the performances to Haggis' writing and Clint's seamless direction, it is a 10/10 and simply an unbelievable experience overall. Watch it. Maybe keep some alcohol on the side.

17 January 2005,As Depressing As It Gets,"Sorry but life's tough enough without our cinema cranking out ""entertainment"" that leaves you depressed as you walk out of the theatre.

Solid enough film but every supporting character seemed like a one dimensional cartoon. From the bully boxer who finally beats up Danger to the cursing priest to the cheap shot boxing champion to her entire cruel hillbilly caricature family, they all seemed one dimensional and poorly presented.

Warner Brothers sets you up. They release this Million Dollar Baby in very limited theaters, just to make sure it is qualified for Oscar contention. They proudly boast that this picture has won numerous awards. It is a picture of noble merits, according to the marketing people.

So we go, we put up with standard boxing movie, that countless sport movies have portrayed over and over again. The kid with no talent who nobody wants blah, blah, blah. Then of course the kid succeeds. Oh yea, go team. Then the third act follows, the twist, the reason we are here, to follow the story to an ending held secret only by those that have been privileged to view this epic.

I won't spoil the movie, but the third act was probably written by an eighth grader. An eighth grader who failed English. I could not believe that this director and team could be so cheesy, following a pattern so used, so boring. I felt robbed.",1
20 February 2019,Million Dollar Baby... Million Dollar Movie,"When one hears that the theme of a movie revolves around a woman trying to become a boxer he may think ""Hmm, that would be good to watch; it is probably another film about a badass girl overturning gender stereotypes"". Well, nothing actually prepares you for what you are about to experience. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is about a woman named Maggie who wants to become a boxer and her relationship with her stone-faced trainer Freddie Dunn. Any other detail concerning the plot is unnecessary and will only prevent the viewer from delving into the world of these two extraordinary characters. And they are really something. Frankie is a living oxymoron, as his formidable, impenetrable form and laconic speech is juxtaposed with a great emotional depth. Maggie is a diamond in the rough who with dignity and passion literally fights her way to the world. I would, however be unjust not to mention Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, the gentle and unsuccessful boxer and current janitor to the gym Freddie owns, who works as a balancing element to the tension caused to the viewer by the explosive nature of the first two. The setting, furthermore, embellishes in it's own way the cinematic experience. The scruffy gym, the adrenaline-filled rings and the hospital are colored in dull, cold colors, so as to work as a neutral setting for the colourful emotions depicted in the film-canvass; and the emotions presented are raw and violent in an overwhelming and almost intoxicating way. So much, that we are compelled to watch until the very end of the movie with only a few precious intervals of humor and nonchalance to comfort us. It is true that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not an easy to film to watch. With it's intelligent depiction of pain, cruelty and injustice it is a reminder of the dark, and yet, realistic side of life that is often overlooked, as it's a hard pill to swallow. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a gem of modern filmmaking with mind-blowing performances, you are more than welcome to give it try. It will upset you, but it will be etched in your heart for a very long time.",9
23 February 2006,Heaven & hell in the ring,"Million Dollar Baby is a pretty straight forward, simple story that people interested in films have likely seen a number of times before. It is, if you will, an old school Hollywood movie. No fancy computer generated effects, no loud music, no fast cuts. More concentrated on the story and acting, it's goals are certainly admirable.

The first half, let's call it heaven, is near overblown in how conveniently everything just falls to the right place, yes, even the very early goings where Clint does his typical 'no, i'm not interested' routine. The second half, call it hell, not entirely surprisingly, is where you really get the almighty Academy's attention. A lot of pain, suffering, crying and ill-turned relations are involved. Even Clint does a crying scene, which sort of surprised me despite the subject matter, after all, wasn't he the guy who during the filming of The Bridges of Madison County said 'they don't wanna see me cry' to his co-star Meryl Streep. All and all, it didn't raise as much emotions in me as it probably was meant to. I wasn't gripping my pillow weeping, or eating the fifth bucket of ice cream by the end of it. Later on during the day i was mumbling a theory while preparing salad, saying to myself, 'what if the story was purposely told in an overblown fashion, because it is after all coming from an individual's memory of the events...usually memory tends to make things just that little bit grander.'

It's the acting that raises the level of this film. Without the great work of Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and especially Morgan Freeman who has only been better than here once during his career, in a movie called Shawshank Redemption, this film would have been just as average as the average guy on the morning bus. Mr. Freeman certainly surpasses the pointless character from his previous collaboration with Eastwood, Unforgiven. Hilary Swank is a very able actor as well, and i wish her a great career. Thanks to the good acting, Million Dollar Baby manages to lift itself barely out from the Swamp of the Abandoned Blue Jeans, where everything looks alike. Maggie's family was just extreme stereotypia, and the most annoying part in the entire run.

From the technical aspects Million Dollar Baby does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. Clint uses shadows a lot to create atmosphere, but at times (in the gym where first Dupris then Dunn step out of the shadows exactly the same corny way to teach all sorts of wise lines to Maggie) it gets borderline silly.

rating: 5/10 - OK",5
19 April 2005,This movie is movie art par excellence,"Well, thinking about Eastwoods career: Tarzan, series cowboy, not too good Dirty Harry sequels and adventures with the monkey, his last 15 years has been absolutely triumphant. And now A million dollar baby. Last night I walked away from theater, weeping with joy. They still do movies with heart, they still do movies without digital workout, they still do movies where actor and actresses do really act IE. perform the art. The brilliance of the three was extraordinary. Just watch Freeman and Eastwood picking on each other, like old couple. And just watch Swanks reaction when she finds out she is going to fight for the belt. Or watch her waisted talent lying in the bed. I don't know many who can make a tear. She can. Here in Finland many say, tear is the ultimate work of acting art. This definitely is the best boxing movie since The Harder they fall... where Bogart made his last role.

19 July 2005,Another good film elevated to undeserving greatness at the Oscars,"The story of a white trash early 30s woman (Swank) determined to be a good boxer and the veteran coach (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes her on board. The tale is narrated by Eastwood's gym buddy Freeman.

Solid direction from Clint, and a surprisingly good acting performance from him too. Swank does nothing wrong, and Freeman brings his usual trademark quiet dignity to his role. The story is simple. Swank surprises everyone with her boxing talent, Eastwood develops paternal feelings towards her and the two of them strike a father-daughter relationship. Swank's lack of a father figure in her life, and her clearly trashy family makes her relationship with Eastwood whose own daughter is estranged from him all the more relevant.

Alas in time Swank gets bested by a top hardcore boxer, and she has to contend with her shattered dreams. Taking a philosophical angle, she contents herself with the thought that despite her career ending defeat and serious injuries she lived a lot more and made more of an impact in her world than she would have if she never got into boxing. Better to live a couple of years with intense passion than a lifetime as trash.

Freeman won his long overdue Oscar, but this again highlights that Oscars are not about the best performances or best pictures. He is as usual good in his role, but he has given more impacting performances in more demanding roles in the past. Somewhat ironic then that he should win his first Oscar for this one.

There is the obligatory sideline goings on at the gym, which feel a bit contrived. However Eastwood's direction is very good, and the three principal leads know what they are doing.

My issue with the film's best picture win is less a criticism of the quality of the film than the politicking going on at the Oscars. Simple effective films like this have won in the past (like Ordinary People deservedly in 1980, Terms of Endearment undeservingly a couple of years later). But the best picture winner must feel like the best picture of the year. That Million Dollar Baby ain't. Eastwood has obviously built up a web of alliances in Hollywood, and is one of it's most influential figures.

I suppose the fact that this film won Best Picture shouldn't be particularly surprising. Almost everyone knows that the Oscars are not about the best. It's about what looks good, what reflects the style and power play of Hollywood the best.",7

28 January 2005,go see this movie now!,"I was close to giving up going to the movies this year, because I was so tired of being disappointed, bored, and disgusted by the poor films that the movie-going public is asked to accept as entertainment these days. ""Million Dollar Baby"" reminded me of how movies could be much more than just special effects, and cobbled-together screenplays that we've all seen before. Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood are tremendously affecting; the movie is about a lot more than just boxing - I think it was an excellent film. Go see it now - it's a movie made the way movies should be made - with brains, heart, and class.

8 April 2005,"""Oh. Thats very good. I'm undone, but not my favorite."" - Johnny Depp, Chocolat","Million Dollar Baby is a story of a girl who has a dream and is hell-bent on fulfilling it, that dream is boxing, the girl is Maggie Fitzgerald. She is dedicated to make her dream come true and is desperate for a coach, and seeks out Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood,) and Dunn is scared off because he ""doesn't train girls."" Dunn finally submits to coaching Fitzgerald, and they are on their way to a title.

The character played by Hillary Swank (Maggie Fitzgerald) is a girl from Missouri, your average hillbilly, who has been a waitress most of her life and wants to get out of that lifestyle, the lifestyle of stealing leftovers for food, and getting paid minimum wage. She is convinced that boxing is that way out, and she goes to a respected, but whole-in-the-wall gym in Los Angeles, only to bug Frankie until he trains her. Soon enough she definitely wasn't the one doing the begging.

He is not optimistic by the idea, considering she has been boxing for three years, and it doesn't show. Clint Eastwood did a wonderful job producing it, directing it, and playing one of the lead characters. His character brought together the seriousness of the movie, along with all the humor. It is a wonderful balancing act for Eastwood, and it works. The Good the Bad and the Ugly star marks this the 25th film he has directed, the 57th film in which he has acted, and the 21st he has produced. He is supported by Morgan Freeman, who is a former boxer, and janitor of the gym.

Morgan Freeman plays Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a muse it seems like, to Fitzgerald. He is the one that taught her how to box, even though Dunn directly told him not to encourage her. He is half blind, and makes fun of himself for it, and is probably the wisest one in this movie, who's counsel will get you thinking. He is a character that demands respect in a quiet way, but when he is angered he is ferocious, the one scene in the movie that shows it anyway.

About the movie, it isn't a ""boxing story,"" or anything of that sort. It is a movie about a father/daughter type relationship. It is a story about devotion, unconditional love, and strength. Later in the movie the characters battle something that I will not go into.

Million Dollar Baby was nominated for 7 AcademyAwards, but went home with four very honorary ones including: Best Motion Picture, Best Actress- Hillary Swank, Best Actor in a Supporting Role- Morgan Freeman, and Best Achievement in Directing.

It is definitely Oscar-worthy, but not the best film I have ever seen. It was a little long, and perhaps they could of spent a little more time on the moral of the movie, but it was a simple story of three people, two passions , one Million Dollar Baby.",5
12 July 2006,A wonderful movie that deserves its place on the top 250 and possibly the greatest films of all time,"Millon Dollar Baby is a expertly directed and wonderfully acted film. Its about a girl,Maggie (Hilary Swank) who comes from a rough background and her trainer, Frankie (Clint Eastwood) who reluctantly takes her under his wing and has problems of his own, including his estranged daughter. The narrator of the story is Scrap (Morgan Freeman),Frankie's friend and a janitor. The movie is about how dreams are lost and come true. The chemistry between the actors was perfect and the movie gets you emotionally in every way possible. It benefits from the realism and humanity of the tale and avoids many clichés.Clint Eastwood may be one of the best directors working today. Bravo to the cast and crew in this soaring triumph!!!

12 March 2005,A solid but really mixed and ultimately unsatisfying effort,"The first two thirds of this film were excellent, with very good boxing/training action and lively performances from Swank and Freeman, and Eastwood even cracking a joke or two. The last third, when the melodrama hits, it hits like a tornado that sucks all the air out of the room and neglects to fill the vacuum. This movie was saved by the acting, but it was fairly chock full of clichés, and the fact that she walked into the gym supposedly after winning a fight throwing punches that off-kilter gave it a believability gap that took a while to get over. If they had started the film without her having stated she had won a fight, the story wouldn't have changed much (well, the clichés would have been a tad more obvious) and my believability would not have been so challenged for the first half hour.

The last third of the film, where the well-known controversy exists, is incredibly long and tedious even in comparison to other melodramas. Without the ending, I would have given it an eight or nine for the lively Swank performance that, like Sylvester Stallone in the first Rocky film, took an old fashioned formula and made something really great out of it. The ending, however, dragged that all the way down to a six. I don't think I could watch it again without turning it off after that key defining event, but if I did, I'd end up watching a much more enjoyable movie.

30 January 2007,i loved it,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
8 November 2006,A Most Wonderful movie,"This is one of the most wonderful movies I've seen in recent times. Kudos to Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman, as always is at his very best.The screenplay of Paul Haggis has kept me guessing all the time. This film does not attempt to satisfy the viewer with a cheap happy ending. But at the end the viewer is bound to feel contented with the effect that it leaves on the mind. This will leave an indelible mark in the history of Hollywood films. Clint Eastwood, no doubt has positioned himself as one of the great directors of this time with this classic form of art at its very best. This is a must see film for all who nurture the passion in the visual form of motion picture.

8 November 2006,Excellent,"Very nice movie. Excellent performance by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank. Very much inspirational movie. Movie name is very much appropriate for the movie. Movie is one of the must watch movie, because it has inspiration for the peoples. Cast is mostly concentrated on the how one should react in life. It is true that life is 10% of the action(accidents) and 90% of reaction for that. The tragedy happened in movie is little unacceptable. Director could have choose something different. But picture is very good and direction is also good. Morgan Freeman played a good role too, how react to different things is nice. End is also good and appropriate. Thanks Dhruv for suggesting to watch this movie.

9 November 2006,A Punch in the Stomach,"This is a very touching human drama movie, with the best director, best actors, and the best story.

""Million Dollar Baby"" directed by Clint Eastwood was released in 2004, and received four Oscars that year. This is a breathtaking human drama about a thirty-one year old Maggie (Hilary Swank) and a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood.)

Maggie a waiter from the poor and dysfunctional family decides to make a change in her life. She asks the experienced boxing trainer Frankie to be her coach and manager. Frankie refuses Maggie at first, but with the help form Frankie's old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Maggie walks in to his gym and starts training.

Maggie is a very determined hard worker and wins 12 matched on a row by KO. Then she starts receiving offers for bigger matches, and Frankie makes a decision to make her go for the championship match against ""Blue Bear"" Billy in Las Vegas. She enters the ring with confidence, but she and Frankie did not know the life waiting for them after this game.

Hilary Swank went for a three months training to prepare for this role, and plays very powerful and emotional role. It is certainly a magnificent performance, and she won her second Oscar for this role, after winning her first one for ""Boys Don't Cry."" Morgan Freeman also plays a wonderful role as Frankie's partner, very quite but has a strong presence. He won his first Oscar for his role, after being nominated four times in the past.

I will give this movie ten out of ten, and recommend it to anyone over 13 years of age. Especially to those who are in a relationship or having trouble with family members. This is not just a simple boxing film, but it makes you think about life and death. This movie has a twist in the end, so do not go to the bathroom in the last 20 minutes. Be prepared, it is going to leave you speechless.",10

1 March 2005,How did it win this many Oscars? The Studios ...,"I made a conscious effort to watch MDB (Million Dollar Baby) the day before the Oscars to have a film to root for (so I wouldn't have to root for Sideways ... terribly overrated). Well, the fact is that MDB is a weak script, very clichéd, and predictable (I won't give away the ""twist"" but it's not as daring as you might imagine).

While I think highly of Clint Eastwood as a director and his previous films (as a director), he needs to remove himself of the Woody Allen megalomaniac desire to be an actor. His acting was stiff and gruff (just like him) without any depth. People say that about Tom Cruise, but Clint Eastwood is just the same version but different vintage.

The weak script didn't prevent Hillary or Morgan from turning two brilliant performances. Hillary earned our empathy and our hearts while Morgan gave us a look into the darker side of a man.

This isn't a boxing movie; it's a character study. While the script is flawed, Morgan and Hillary do a wonderful job in turning a strong performance. As for the others, it's so-so.

And Oscar-worthy? Well, save it for the DVD.",5

15 December 2006,10 out of 10,"An outstanding film that shows what Clint Eastwood can do when he puts his mind to it.

My understanding was that this film was completed in only 37 days of shooting.

Perhaps other film makers can take a lesson from this movie.

I would like to see them work towards making movies that people will enjoy watching.

It seems much of what seems more of the same formula coming out most major studios today.

Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood had some genuine chemistry in this movie.

Hope he keeps it up.",10
24 May 2005,An Average Film; Nothing More,"I can't see what is so good about Million Dollar Baby. It is an average film; that is all. The biggest problem I have with it is that the storyline seems to attempt to be true-to-life but if you examine it, it is so utter preposterous: a woman in the first flushes of middle age (Hilary Swank) decides to start boxing and convinces a reluctant veteran (Clint Eastwood) to train her; then within a year or two she is a boxing world champion defeating the stereotypical evil European opponent. (Frankly, when I see an American film that contains a ""foreign baddie"" (and sadly, so many do), it's a pretty clear indicator as to what kind of audience they are targeting.) Give me a break. I can't see how anyone can take seriously such an absurd tale.

Are you detecting shades of Rocky here? Yes, so was I. So not only is the storyline preposterous, it is unoriginal as well. The only thing that saves the film is the emotionally stirring scenes near the end as the boxer deals with tragic events that afflict her life. They are excellently acted and brought a lump to my throat. However, not even that can offset the ever-predicable and toe-curling subplots about the loud-mouth bully being put in his place and the no-hoper who just never gives up. You don't need me to elaborate on those subplots any more - you've seen them in a thousand other films. Aren't audiences getting tired of this by now? Where's the originality? Where's the realism?",6
10 August 2005,Morgan Freeman as the narrator!,"Great movie with great direction and story. Perfect casting and performances from the leading actors.

Choose Morgan Freeman as a narrator and you can't fail, his dark, deep voice creates the perfect atmosphere also in this movie like in Shawnshank Redemption. Certainly casting Morgan Freeman do this part and letting his character tell the story was the single most important thing to make this movie one of the great ones

Clint Eastwood once again showed that his true talent lies in directing.

""Only"" 9/10 because this still is not a movie which I would watch once a year or would enjoy every shot or camera angle or every minute of the musical score like for example C'era una volta il West or Lawrence of Arabia or Shawnshank.

27 February 2005,"At bottom, it's just a boxing movie...","Yes, the movie is well done for its genre, but they've been making versions of this movie for more than 60 years, and modulo some details and production values, they're pretty much the same. I could have gone into the screening with a checklist of things that are supposed to happen in a boxing movie, and when I came out, all the items would have been checked.

There are only a couple of boxing films that have broken the mold in some way. I'm sure there were others, but the first two I can think of offhand are Raging Bull and the first Rocky.

It was a good movie, but one of the best films of 2004? No way. It's not even the best film Clint Eastwood has ever directed. (That honor would go to Mystic River.)

30 January 2005,The great white Hype,"Alright I must say firstly that I adore Clint Eastwood having always been enamored with his older films. However, I went to see this film this weekend and I honestly have to say that it just wasn't as great as I've heard. It was a fine film yes, but I do not think that this film is ""...Eastwood's masterpiece"" as so many have stated. The films's scenes seemed to drag on and the last scenes seemed just far to melodramatic. I felt cheated as if I was being led into feelings throughout.

With this being said, I must say that the acting was fairly well done. Freeman is amazing as always, Swank was very good, but I still believe there are other actresses this year that deserve more notice. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a fine film, but I think that Eastwood peaked with ""Mystic River"" and that this hype is somewhat undeserving. Still I recommend seeing the film.

For one thing, I really have no idea why Morgan Freeman is in this, because his character seems to serve no other purpose than being a narrator (which is unfortunately what the man seems to be most famous for these days). However, this is without a doubt a very good, and for one useless supporting character, we have two very well-written main characters.

At this point I would usually write some sort of light summary of the plot, but it is very hard to do this for MILLION DOLLAR BABY without giving away a very interesting plot twist. And it is this twist that will either make or ruin the movie for most people. All that one needs to know is that this is about boxing and the will to be the best. Mostly.

The main problem with this film is that some of the drama feels clichéd and forced, which is interesting because the film is at its best when its doing exactly the opposite: being unpredictable. The result is a film that feels a little uneven. Nonetheless, this is a satisfying watch.

Recommended to people who don't mind depressing dramas.",7
16 July 2005,One of the best films ever.,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",9

13 March 2005,Brilliant Character Study,"Clint Eastwood does a fantastic job with a poor script in creating a moving film about the interplay of three people Frankie Dunn, (Clint Eastwood), Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), and Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) as they each battle their inner demons and move their lives forward without destroying each other's lives.

Frankie Dunn is a washed-up trainer whose recent prospect dumps him because Frankie doesn't believe in him, doesn't want the fighter to go for the championship. Frankie Dunn is overprotective of himself and his fighters, and his fighters believe the protectiveness is more than a professional liability, it's a belief culture. Eddie Dupris is the loyal friend, ex-near champion boxer who lost an eye in Frankie's care. Maggie Fitzgerald is the female boxer, trying to escape her past and redefine her job, who finds boxing as a way to express and measure herself. She goes to Frankie for training, and eventually, these three are forced to deal with Maggie's success and Frankie's fear of her failing - or is it him failing her?",9
14 July 2005,One of the best films I've seen in years.,"I must say, when I rented this movie I did not expect too much. I love Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank but I tend to be ""gun shy"" of movies that win big at the Oscars. It starts out as a typical ""formula"" movie but then throws a curve that even I never expected. I was very moved and broken-hearted by the turn of events and haven't felt so overwhelming sad over a movie in decades. Morgan Freeman's voice-over narration is a bit hard to hear at times and Clint's gruff voice is hard to understand at times. It's a slow-paced movie but always manages to keep your interest. The sheer brutality of the fights that Hillary's character wins is awesome. Who would of thought she'd pack such a powerful punch! Without giving away the tragic twist, I'd just like to say that I consider this movie a ""must-see"". Make sure you have a box of Kleenex close at hand.

16 October 2005,Painfully average?,"When ""Million Dollar Baby"" came out, I didn't care about seeing it. There are many films I don't bother seeing at the cinema, and this was one of them, it just didn't interest me. The hype starts growing, critics are hailing it as a masterpiece, and before long it's picked up 4 Oscars including best picture. So when it comes out on DVD, I decide to rent it, after all, I have nothing to lose.

This is not a terrible film. Unfortunately, it isn't an excellent film either, and would be summed up best by the words 'painfully average'. There is nothing special about it. The story is nothing special, it's the simple sports underdog story we've seen so many times before, it didn't have anything that really pushed it towards anything more than average. I don't understand the big deal with the acting performances in this film, they're nothing special, and the script is average as well.

Every single character is just a walking cliché; Danger could well be one of the most pointless characters ever. We get it, this guy is all about heart but he can't fight to save his life. There was no need for any of his appearances on screen; it was a pointless character trying to put across some sort of message.

The main thing that made me dislike the film was the final 30-40 minutes, in which Eastwood tries to change the direction the film is going, but fails in my opinion. While it sounds as if I hated the film from start to finish, I didn't, it had good pacing and was quite interesting to watch, despite its flaws, up until this point. The final half hour is extremely long-winded, taking ages to reach its obvious conclusion, and failing to generate any sort of reaction with its supposedly tragic ending. It was this section that I really disliked, it went straight for the heartstrings, yet wasn't tragic enough to pull them.

Discussion over the success of ""Million Dollar Baby"" will continue until long into the future, but in my opinion it was a failure, which plodded along without ever reaching the level of brilliance, ending with a conclusion which missed the mark.",5
6 November 2005,Bravo,"I just finished watching this movie, and i tell you its one of the best movies i have ever seen, the storyline is awesome, i am 32 years old and after watching this movie i tell you a couple of tears ran down my cheeks , it makes you wonder how far do people go to make their dreams come true, i really advise everyone to watch this movie. i have seen all the movies directed by Mr. Eastwood and i think he gets better each time , all of his movies seem to be very unique it seems that he tries to let the audience dazzle thru the whole movie without people knowing how the movie will end and i think thats what make his movies stand out,

17 January 2005,A Very Pleasant Surprise,"OK. I'm not the biggest fan of clint eastwood really so i wasn't really expecting all that much from this movie. Then add on its a boxing movie it was like OK, ill watch it but don't expect it to be any good.

Well much to my surprise this is a very good movie to watch. The acting was excellent on all parts and you really got into the characters. You didn't dare leave your seat in case you might miss something in it. I can see why it got nominated for awards because it definitely deserves it. Maybe ill watch more of clints stuff if he keeps this good work up.

Overall i would give it 7 out of 10 and most definitely worth full admission price to watch it.

19 March 2005,Good story telling technique but script is lackluster compared to everything else.,"Million Dollar Baby is a very good film. If I were to make a top ten, it would be on there but not before probably 4-6 films. This is not Clint Eastwood's best directorial job. It is however his best performance as an actor and in my mind, deserved more recognition than just a nomination. Swank and Freeman are both very good but in my opinion they fall short of Eastwood's performance. Most critics and industry people are jaded because they form relationships with these people and root for them and that taints the accuracy of reviews and nomination processes Freeman won this year because he should have won a long time ago for either Driving Miss Daisy or Shawshank Redemption, whereas this year the actual best performance in that category was clearly Thomas Haden Church. Swank won because she was in the best movie at the best release time. If Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind was more popular and was released after Halloween, Kate Winslet would be billed everywhere in every magazine as the next Meryl. I think what makes this film fall short of being an immortal piece of work is the script. It's good, like everything else in the movie (except maybe cinematography, but that's being very picky). However, Haggis' script is not insightful enough. There is too much responsibility on the actor's side to give us insight into the suffering all of them have suffered and are suffering. That is why I feel Eastwood's performance is the best in the entire film. He tells us everything that has gone on in his life with just his look and voice. Freeman and Swank give us some indication but not to the depth. Had Haggis provided more insight into the struggles of Scrap and the drama between Maggie and her family or a deeper relationship exploration between her and Frankie, this would have moved me deeper and placed it among the great American movies.",7
10 February 2005,Let down by the script,"In the words of Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, ""I don't want to cram in characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcome obstacles to succeed in the end"". This quote seem very appropriate for this film seeing as all three main characters went through the cliché that is overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end.

It is the script the lets down Million Dollar Baby, a film that would have been very good otherwise. Some of the dialogue is painfully unfunny when it tries to be. The voice-over is overused and tells the viewer what to think. The story of overcoming personal difficulties to become a boxing champ is almost identical to that of the Rocky films, there's even a Rocky style montage sequence. Worst of all was the ending, which was completely unnecessary and badly done.

The rest of Million Dollar Baby was pretty good however. Clint Eastwood does a brilliant job in acting, directing and scoring this movie and all the actors do a good job in portraying characters that were badly written.

6 March 2005,Million Dollar Booby,"Disappointed.

I invariably enjoy Clint Eastwood, rate Hilary Swank, and relish anything with Morgan Freeman in it.

Don't get me wrong, however - there's nothing really wrong with this movie, simply that we've seen it all before. Now I come to write about it, you know what taste it leaves me with? That of a Sunday afternoon made-for-TV movie - decent production values, distinctly pedestrian script enthusiastically delivered in amateurish fashion (I know - shocking, considering the cast, but perhaps the tight filming schedule had something to do with it), and a hackneyed, seen-it-all-before plot.

Let me try and draw on the positives: Morgan Freeman - sterling performance under trying circumstances... erm... that's about it, actually. Just too many problems with poorly drawn stereotypes and insufficiently developed, confusing subplots.

Did it move me? Crumbs, no! Oscar-winner? Hmmmm...

Still, there y'go. 6/10",6
14 June 2006,"...a well-realized movie, but not for everyone...","This movie is sensitive, compassionate, intelligent, touching, and deals with a topical social issue- assisted suicide.

The acting is excellent and the direction is more than competent.

However the movie is also primarily naturalistic and goes to one of those places I don't find at all appealing in the art I seek out. I believe this kind of subject matter is better dealt with in television documentaries or news stories, not in cinematic art.

I realize that many people would disagree. But if you are one of those who don't like to go to a movie to be made to feel pity at a tragic spectacle- then avoid this film.

Clint Eastwood has sold out it appears...after being envied and vilified early in his career ( for the spaghetti westerns and Dirty Harry movies )...he has capitulated in stages to the establishment to the point where he has become an establishment icon.",7

19 June 2011,One time was enough...,"There are those movies, so good that they force you to laugh hysterically, make you sit on the edge of your chair, let you crawl under a blanket, eat your nails, or cry like a child. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the latter ones, and for me it's a rare thing to cry indeed.(Only equaled by ""The Hours"" Perhaps.) Who would want to tape the last few hours in the life of a family member, and want to see him or her dying over and over again? It's like that for me with this movie. I've rarely felt a pain of such magnitude after watching a movie. That is the reason why I don't want to see this film again. It's a fantastic movie, don't get me wrong, but if you decide to watch it, don't be surprised to get knocked in the stomach by an iron fist.

11 July 2018,Raging Bull will still be the best boxing movie,"I loved Million Dollar Baby, but I think that Ray was way better, but I do not know why because you would expect me to like Million Dollar Baby more than Ray because of the amount of violence in Million Dollar Baby. Well anyway, I would give Million Dollar Baby an A, for the cast's splendid acting, wonderful story, and for Eastwood's superb directing. This is Clint Eastwood's second time winning Best Picture, now it should have been his third time winning it because he should have won it the year before for Mystic River, but he did not which really pisses me off. I am sad that he ( Clint) did not win Best Actor but that was expected knowing that Jamie Foxx was nominated for it too, so there was no way he ( Clint) could have won it. Eastwood does a fabulous job directing like he always does, but you should not walk into Million Dollar Baby thinking it will be anything like Unforgiven or Mystic River. One thing that I really like about Eastwood's more recent movies, is how they are not all the same. You see him in all the western movies from the 60's, then he wins Best Picture in 92 with Unforgiven which is a western movie, then he does some fewer none movies, then he makes Mystic River which is a full-on drama, very different from Unforgiven. He then wins the next year with Million Dollar Baby a movie nothing like Mystic River, now he is making mostly war movies, but he has kept his movies different in their own unique way and I like that he does that. The acting Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal, even if the character is only a minor part, it is amazing. The priest who is only in 2 scenes, he still did a great job. The dick Anthony Mackie plays, I mean he did a good job playing a dick, so good job, I guess? I think the best acting of a minor character would be Danger, the kid who has some mental disadvantage, Jay Baruchel does an amazing job pulling off the part of Danger. Morgan Freeman got his first Oscar which is surprising for an actor as good as himself it surprises me that he has not won any other Oscars. He does a great job in all of his roles, I personally think that he should have won Best Actor for his role as Nelson Mandela in Invictus. Hilary Swank gets her second Oscar so go her, she won her first in Boy's don't Cry, she does a really good job and she deserves the Oscar for Million Dollar Baby. The movie is an adaptation of the story Ropes Burn by F.X. Toole. I have not read it but from what I have heard it was a good adaptation, Paul Haggis does a good job turning the story into a modern time period. Million Dollar Baby is a very good story about a woman who wants to be a boxer. She does become a boxer, but only after intense persuasion and proof that she is ready to fight. Oh yeah, also the fact that she is a woman in 2004 so people were less respecting of women, especially women who were trying to fill in the shoes of a boxer, a role that is normally done by men. In fact, she is so good at boxing that she knocks all of her opponents out only in the first few seconds which is good but Eastwood's character does not think that is giving her any practice. But because of that she barely receives pain from the other opponents, and that will catch up to her later in her boxing career. Million Dollar Baby reminds me of Rocky, Rocky 2, Rocky 3, Rocky 4, but it does not remind me of Rocky 5 or Raging Bull. I think you can see why 4 of the Rocky movies remind me of Million Dollar Baby. To conclude, I would give Million Dollar Baby an A, for the cast's splendid acting, wonderful story, and Eastwood's superb directing.",8
26 August 2018,Master class in drama,"Clint Eastwood has a no frills approach to directing. There are no fancy shots or creative techniques which tell this true story. However, if you like concise story telling with no padding and great acting then this film might be for you.

Hilary Swank plays an Oscar worthy role as ""Maggie""a determined young woman from a poor family who wants to become a professional boxer. Eastwood plays the trainer, ""Frankie"", who runs a gym in Los Angeles. Narrated expertly by Morgan Freeman who also plays ""Scrap"" who was managed by Frankie into a title bout.

""Million Dollar Baby"" is a dark film with an autobiographical feel that never distracts from the characters. It is about a woman determined to make something of herself, and a man who becomes her best friend through her career and final tragedy.

30 January 2006,"The Worst ""Best Picture"" I Can Recall","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

17 October 2005,"So lost in agenda, they missed the point","It is a greater disappointment to believe in the ones you love whenever they clearly strive to fail you on purpose.

Eastwood and Freeman have so often revealed magic that I had come to trust them for artistic integrity. Million Dollar Baby destroyed that belief. This film is little more than a wobbly-wheeled vehicle for a man intent on portraying a disconsolate, washed-up, never-quite-made-it human being, (Heartbreak Ridge, The Unforgiven, Space Cowboys) intent on having us feel sorry for him despite the fact he never took the risk to claim his own slice of life, and it fails both as story and as art.

I am disappointed by the clear failure to work the parallel between the ring and the altar. The story's narrator openly defines the relationship between a boxer and her trainer, and we have numerous examples of that relationship at work. We are presented with Frankie's own journey toward spiritual discipline (a journey we all share) and we anticipate the priest's role as an opportunity to develop the parallel. But the writer (?) producer (?) director (?) let it fall flat upon the screen as an empty suit and I for one was disappointed. This was not a story element overlooked, but clearly inserted into the story and then abandoned (because it might add a glimmer of light into the gloom?).

Then, we are given Maggie's unyielding trust in Frankie though never where it originated nor what of anything between them nourishes it; and through to the end, we wait for the reveal that never comes. Instead, we are asked to watch Frankie trash her gift as an ode to his own tragic life. The film offers us not so much the art of story telling as of despair.

That crumbling sound you hear is another bit of Eastwood's audience falling away.",2
19 February 2005,Million Dollar Baby is all hype!,"I can only imagine that the film industry and its critics feel that Clint Eastwood only has a limited time left on this planet, and deserves one last rave review before he goes to meet that big 'gun-slinger' in the sky. Million Dollar Baby is all hype! The movie is slow moving and predictable lacking any sign of an intelligent story line. If you have ever been involved in the Boxing scene you will know that there are plenty of interesting avenues to travel down for a really good story line; looking for this avenue Clint lost his way and found himself in 'Jerry Springer-land'! Yep! This movie is that believable! The fight scenes in this picture were as bad has those we have witnessed in the 'Rocky' movies and Eastwoods fake 'gruff' voice helped continue the misleading stereo-type of Boxing trainers. The thing that separates Eastwood's movie from Stallone's (particulary the first of the Rocky series)is the lack of empathy the audience can share with the characters.

Finally, what was the moral of this story? Girls with fat mothers in trailers should Box?? I sat this movie out until it's 'drawn-out' end, hoping that a referee would step in and save me from further punishment. No more awards for this movie please, give 'em to Jim Carey he deserves them!",

10 September 2019,Winners do what losers don't,"If there's magic in boxing, it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.

23 February 2011,A real tearjerker; Eastwood knows what's up,"It's funny how life can sometimes turn lemons into lemonade and vice-versa. I've been knocked down by the flu for the last week, cursing my raspy cough and the boredom of bed-rest. AMC has started up their recent Oscar-nominated run this week with the Oscars hitting on Saturday night, and this movie is one they're showing at various times this week. So as I was laying in bed feeling sorry for myself, I turned this movie on just as it was starting, and I was enthralled for the next three hours.

I've seen quite a few Eastwood flicks over the last several years, and I loved Gran Turino, his most recent movie. But this movie tops them all. First of all, Eastwood is outstanding. He was nominated for best actor by the Oscars the year this came out, and it's easy to see why. He's the perfect boxing trainer. He channels a little bit of Mick, but he comes across as a heck of a lot less cartoonish. But the multiple directions that he takes the character, from his estrangement with his daughter to the protecting of Swank's character (maybe he saw her as a replacement for his daughter) were great.

The only person that upstaged Eastwood, however, was Hillary Swank. I hadn't taken Swank seriously as an actress for several years since her Beverly Hills 90210 days. She seemed like she was set for TV from the get-go. But in the last few years, she's acted in two movies that have really changed my opinion of her acting abilities. This movie is the first one, obviously, and the second was Freedom Writers, which she also directed. She was outstanding in both, but this movie set the bar extremely high. The thing is that she's so believable as a boxer, but there are so many other facets to her performance. Anybody that's grown up in a small town and escaped could tell you what it's like to try to reconnect to a family that doesn't understand you anymore, and she portrays that so well on the screen. It's heartbreaking. Swank took an Oscar for best actress from this movie (her second), and there is a lot of dispute as to whether it was earned, as always. Coincidentally, this was also the second time that she beat out Annette Benning for best actress. Personally, I thought her performance was Oscar-worthy.

Morgan Freeman was playing Red again from Shawkshank Redemption, but this time he was nominated and won an Oscar for a supporting role, rather than losing best actor in a leading role as in Shawshank. He was typical Freeman. He's the glue that holds things together.

Overall, the movie was a real eye-opener. The main theme ""Always Protect Yourself"" is so true in all walks of life, and it's a truth that a lot of us have to discover the hard way, I suppose.",9

19 July 2011,I think it's Freeman's best performance.,"Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.

And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.

As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for.",
2 March 2005,Sappy film undeserving of Oscars.,"An overly sappy drama that tries too hard to be a political statement, which is something it isn't at all. Mediocre work from Hilary Swank - Maggie was a mix between Brandon Teena & her character in the Karate Kid, I'm sad to say.

I don't see all the big fuss about the movie. And, the title is not appropriate whatsoever; the film was not even worth the $7 I paid for the ticket.

Did not deserve the Oscars it won, excluding Freeman.

They mine as well give me an Oscar, since they seem to be shoveling them over to Ms. Swank...who, as she reminded us, was ""raised in a trailer.""

Well Hilary, we sure can tell.

25 March 2006,tiresome,"It seems it's been done before and better. Some very talented work here, but the sum is far less than the parts. The very talented Morgan Freeman is made to drone on in narrative, much like in the Shawshank Redemption (where it had greater effect), but is hampered by poorer writing. Hilary Swank is also very talented, but also has to muscle past mediocre (at best) writing. How Clint Eastwood has sustained a career is a testament to ""it's not what you know but who you know"". This is the Hollywood Complex cranking up the mood lighting and calling it ""art"". But I suppose I should be thankful that it didn't contain a load of shaky camera work or jittery editing in the fight scenes. Maybe it can be recommended on that little bit of artistic backbone. It seems lately that any movie portraying action is out to induce a maximum of epileptic fits.

7 March 2005,if you have seen this movie...(spoiler),"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
6 November 2014,"I DESPISE Boxing as the Devil's ""Sport,"" ...","Still I was able to appreciate this deservingly award-winning movie.

It really proves my point, that boxing is the playpen of sadists inspired by Satan. I resisted watching it for all these years because of its subject matter.

I don't regret watching it at all. If it doesn't jerk a tear or dozens from you, you would have to be inhuman.

Great performances by the lead actors who deserved their Oscars.

Even the sorry, sad family of Hilary Swank's character, Maggie, did a great job of being despicable.

Clint Eastwood is beyond awesome. It looks like we may have enjoyed the last of his formidable talent. I regret that he's mortal like the rest of us. :-(

For all you pugilist haters out there like me, please give it a chance anyway.

You won't come away disappointed, I promise.",8
30 January 2005,"Solid, Understated, Top-Flight....","Eastwood, although not the rangiest of talents, understands perfectly, here, how to deliver superbly within those restraints (particularly as an actor). As a director, he frames the scenes very well - plaintive, yet effective, and - in a couple of cases - extremely artfully. Plus, the cuts are well-guided. He doesn't over-linger - maximum impact for the intelligent...no...for really any viewer....

I like the fact that he's putting out strong, and sensitive work at an advancing age. He's really easy to root-for here.

And his music contributions (the piano and orchestral stuff) are really very strong, and appropriate.

Hillary Swank is great - believable, endearing.... Morgan Freeman - well, what's not to like?",9

31 January 2005,An Enjoyable Film,"Going into the movie theater I wasn't sure what to expect. I had heard a little about Million Dollar, but not a whole lot. But now I have to admit it's just as good as they say it was. I'm not really a boxing fan, but that didn't take away from my movie experience at all. It was a very enjoyable movie with a good story, the characters were likable, and the acting was good.

The story is about a girl, Maggie(Hilary Swank), who wants to be a boxer. She is seeking Frankie(Clint Eastwood) to be her trainer, but Frankie is reluctant because ""girlie, tough ain't enough"". That's all I'm really going to go into the story because I'd hate to be the one to ruin it for somebody else. Anyway great acting from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. I really thought they were the people they were playing.

Well, an excellent movie for anyone(except young children). Go with your friends or whoever and just enjoy it. 10/10

5 May 2013,This film is a must see!,"Million Dollar baby follows the journey of Maggie (Hilary Swank) as she works toward her goal of becoming a professional boxer. Her first fight is to convince Frankie (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer and show her the way to the top. This film is set and directed in such a way where there is not a lot of emphasis on a particular characters story or life but simply highlights the ups and downs of each character. The main focus is on Maggie and her journey however the film also incorporates the stories of Frankie and Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who is Frankie's assistant. This film offers so much to the viewer. It does a great job in creating a deep connection between the viewer and the characters. It is set in such a way that the viewer feels like they a part of the film. It is easy to feel for each character especially when Maggie is dealing with her unappreciative mother and other family members. Maggie is a very tough and loyal woman and inhibits the type of determination that does not show any signs that she is afraid to fail. This movie is simple yet complex and offers a very interesting plot and theme. It is refreshing to see a hard hearted character like Frankie begin to soften from scene to scene and be able to appreciate his loyalty and protectiveness towards Eddie and Maggie. He is tough on the exterior and that is what makes his character so believable. Clint Eastwood is a talented actor and was able to make the character Frankie come alive. Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank also delivered outstanding performances in this film. It was also nice to see Maggie as her character grew from scene to scene. You cannot help but appreciate her character and how even though her boxing career begins to take off she still remains the same and never forgot where she came from. When I watched this film I assumed that it would be a movie based and centered around boxing but it was so much more than that. Whether it is boxing, obtaining a new career, or any type of goal that we have this movie showcased how much work and determination it really takes to reach a goal. Maggie's character is a role model for what women of all ages can achieve. She entered into what Frankie saw as a man's sport and took it by storm. This film is a must see.",9
5 May 2013,Great Film,"Maggie (played by Hilary Swank) takes us on an amazing journey as she tries to work her way up to becoming a professional women boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Frankie (played by Clint Eastwood) is a straight to the point out of date trainer, who Maggie only wants to have train her. The main focus of the film is watching Maggie as she develops into a professional boxer while also shedding light onto Frankie and his side story with his daughter. The viewers are drawn into and develop along side of these characters only to be setup for a brutal end. You become closer to Maggie as you see how everyone else in her family holds zero to no hope for her and only care about themselves. You become stronger as Maggie does as she shows a strong determination and drive even when people tell her she can't do it or it can't be done. As the film progresses you start to understand how Frankie became the way he has and understand why be starts to open up to Maggie and treats her like his own daughter and him as her father. This film has many ties back to Rocky as far as the boxing aspect of the film. You are pulling for the underdog and you are alongside them as they grow as a person, but that is where the ties end. Million Dollar Baby will find you heart strings and take you on an emotional journey one with many highs and lows and make you come out on the other side asking how I got here. Must see.",9

15 December 2018,A Movie about Everything!,"This movie is not about just boxing. It's not about boxing at all. It's about determination, hope, life, facing life, feeling life, living the time of one's life. It shows you everything. A movie containing all of the emotions. It's not just another boxing movie. It teaches you something.

It's the story of a girl who's dreaming to become a great boxer. She is a waitress. But her passion is to become a boxer. She trains alone for a long time and finally decides to train under a professional and she chooses to train under frankie, a cantankerous old man. First he refuses to teach her because he don't like to train females. And he also taunts her saying she is too old to start a boxing carrier. But after a while he feels sorry for her and starts to train her. To see what happens after, you really need to see the movie. It's really worth watching. And it's very emotional. No one can really watch this movie without shedding a single tear. If you are looking for some motivation, some inspiration, just go watch it. I'm 100% sure you won't regret it!",8

4 December 2006,A retrospective review,"Million Dollar Baby beat off strong competition from The Aviator to claim the Best Picture of the Year award at the Academy Awards and it's not hard to see why.

Back in the director's chair, Clint Eastwood pulls no punches in this adaptation of a short story by former pugilist F.X Toole. As well as calling the shots behind the camera, Clint himself plays a starring role in the film.

Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a world-weary boxing trainer who is in the wake of a painful estrangement from his daughter. Frankie lives by two rules, number one, ""protect yourself"" and number two, ""I don't train female fighters."" Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank, wants to be a prize-winning boxer and she's willing to do whatever it takes to get there. Frankie soon finds her training uninvited in his gym, demanding that he teach her how to reach the top.

After several refusals to help, it soon becomes clear that Maggie isn't going to leave unless he agrees to take her on. Thus beginning the first of many battles of will that these two fiery characters will face together.

Nominated for seven Academy Awards, viewers who like their films traditionally slow paced will find great reward here. There are no gimmicks on show, just plain old storytelling. This marks a refreshing change from the staccato direction usually on show in the latest Hollywood blockbuster. However, it isn't without its flaws. At times it does become a little emotionally manipulative, occasionally demanding a visceral response from the audience instead of inducing emotion, as its message gets rammed home a little too much as the film reaches its climax.

Overall though, with great performances from the leading actors and reliably fine support from the eminently impressive and Oscar winning Morgan Freeman, Million Dollar Baby is an enjoyable watch.

23 March 2005,"Stupid moral: If you can't win, KILL YOURSELF","Let's just talk about the movie as a story and the characters as characters and forget what it's trying to teach us for a minute.

As a story, it sucks. The characters are unmotivated. The characters and events are not believable. Non-essential characters litter the screen.

Off the top of my head: - The movie's Jar Jar Binks character - the retarded kid who can't figure out how they get the ice in the bottle - if he were not in the movie it would be shorter and not lose any ""impact"" (such as it is). He's unessential to the story. Lose him.

The German boxer who is widely known to cheat but hasn't been kicked out of professional boxing. This isn't WWF, it's supposed to be real boxing and yet this character is not in jail. Unbelievable.
















This is the movie that refuses to die. It's too long. Within minutes of the incident in which Hilary Swank is injured, we get the picture. Bring it to an end. But there's like another hour of nothing after that. Kill somebody. Blow something up. Burn something down. End it.

One reviewer said most of the audience sat through the credits in order to get ahold of their emotions. When I saw it everyone just got up and left. My wife cries at just about everything in movies and she found nothing emotional in this one. As for my part, I was crying tears of joy that it was over. Finally.

Here's the kicker: The movie tries to change your mind about the idea of ""mercy killing"", but the fact that the goal-oriented, determined, all-sacrificing professional athlete star of the movie COMPLETELY GIVES UP sends this message: If you're pursuing a goal and you meet a setback, KILL YOURSELF.

If you liked this movie, you don't understand anything about how movies should be put together. You're focusing on the questionable moral implications and thinking that makes it ""deep"". Frankly, Sideways was deeper, and it was shallow. This is a horrible movie that serves only to reveal the deep liberal political and moral biases of the motion picture industry. They abandoned their status as professional story-tellers to award a movie based on their politics and religious views. Nobody who knows anything about storytelling could possibly give this movie an Oscar unless their political and religious feelings overwhelmed their common sense.",
5 November 2005,wow bad movie,"In my personal opinion, this movie is just awful. It's way too long and too violent. The boxing looks fake and it's just too bloody. There's no real point to the story. Maggie's mom is such a witch with a capital B. In general, the movie sucks! Don't waste your time or money! Now I have to fill up a bunch of lines to be considered ""ready for submission."" Anyhoo, it's a bad movie. I hate boxing and I don't like Hilary Swank so I hated the movie. I think Clint Eastwood didn't do a good job either. I don't understand why everyone said he was great. He really wasn't. Neither was Morgan Freeman. God what a stupid, dumb, ridiculous, long, boring, violent, pointless movie. I'm never going to waste my time on that piece of poop again.

6 March 2005,this is an Academy Award best picture?,"I think the Academy Awards are a popularity contest. That is the only explanation for awarding this film BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR.

I have seen all five nominees for 2004. My favorite was FINDING NEVERLAND, second to AVIATOR. While I didn't care for SIDEWAYS, I thought it was better than MILLION DOLLAR BABY. NOt only did it not deserve an academy award for best picture, it didn't deserve a nomination either. I am happy that Morgan Freeman won but I strongly feel he should have won for DRIVING MISS DAISY and this was a consolation prize. There are parts of this movie that do not make sense; i do not wish to spoil the plot but certain hospital scenes would not happen in real life.

WHile I like Mr. Eastwood's work in general (I thought IN THE LINE OF FIRE *was* a masterpiece) I did not like this at all.

5 November 2016,A great movie indeed,"I was looking for a motivational movie. First portion goes with my way but suddenly it nuanced the vibe into another premise. The movie arises a fundamental question about 'Euthanasia', this is a very disputable topic, throws some bitterly true questions to the cognitively enriched species sapiens.

A bollywood movie was made inspired after it, 'Guzarish'. The theme startled me intensively, bogged down with these dialects. So, of course the previous brainstorming curbed me from going to the similar state again. The girl acted here so beautifully, of course I'm fully energised watching her endeavor.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",2

25 January 2005,Best film of the year,"I have just seen the movie. For the first half of the movie I wanted to be a boxer. The movie script was designed perfectly. I felt that I was in the movie myself, sharing the same feeling as the characters in the movie. It grabbed my heart and played with it till the end of the movie.

When the movie ended I just couldn't believe that it was over, I just slowly moved my hands to wipe my tears so that no one else would see them. The movie is very inspiring, it is a very good movie, 99% sure that it is the best movie of the year. Already won Golden Globe, has to get at least 3 Oscars for the Best film, The Actor and the Actress. Clint Eastwood was awesome, Hilary Swank made me cry, what else can I say. You have to see it for yourself. Of course in a theatre, that's the way to do it.

26 January 2005,million dollar baby best film ever,"this is by far the best movie that i have ever seen it leaves you at the edge of the seat. the ending leaves you in awe because it is something that Clint Eastwood always does in his movies. This is the first movie i saw in 2005 and i don't think that any other movie will be better that this movie is. i love the movie because it is about female boxing and that i one thing that i have always wanted to do. I love how Clint Eastwood directed the movie. Million Dollar Baby really lives up to the name i would give it a million thumbs up. I think that this movie should sweep all the awards and i think that everyone should see this movie it will keep you thinking.

28 January 2005,Go See it before you read reviews,"One of the most , if not THE most hauntingly powerful films I have ever seen. DO NOT read reviews of the story line as there is a major plot change that the so called critics would spoil. Critics think their brilliant reviews require them to tell the plots, as if we couldn't follow it ourselves. Do yourself a favor, trust me, go see it, if you're not moved, go to the nearest emergency room and have them check to see if you're alive! Acting was great, writing was great and I was completely taken away. Well shot, nice boxing atmosphere and good support from the ensemble. Twist was totally unexpected as it should be.. Eastwood took a great risk in not following the Hollywood formula of ""Happily ever after"". I wish more movies were like this. Get rid of the ""Suits"" and make films like this one. Thanks Clint,this movie will haunt me for a while. WOW! Go to see it NOW!

I'm an actor, please contact me for your next audition. I'd be proud to be in a movie this good!

11 November 2005,"Big emotions, nice fights... but where is the value?","It is so sad that movies like this one win so much attention. Why? Is it because Clint Eastwood did the job or is it because of the more common phenomena of the Americans' humble minds? The plot is so simple and everything in this movie is cliché and overkill - exaggerated extremities in all the simple characters. Everything seems so made up and so so so sad and dramatic that it just isn't what it should be: a story about a female boxer and her trainer. Watching the movie I was drown in all the ""strong"" emotions that, in the end, it just didn't feel right. It is not right because you will never encounter these bittersweet black and white feelings in real life but just in a Hollywood movie like this one. It was so extremely serious and dramatic that it even seemed to be a masochistic parody. The closer it came to its end the more often I thought ""Come on, ANOTHER BAD THING?"" until the absolute climax was reached. For me, that was the suicidal part of the story. The first half was quite nice but then it just decrease until an absolute surreal and spoiling overkill end came. What is the value of this movie? It didn't ""move my mind""; and moving a mind is, in my opinion, the crucial emergent element of a good movie. Sorry, but this one is just selling primitive American-style cliché. Exactly 2 points for the two things that this movie could convey: strong emotions and nice fights.",2
28 February 2021,A knockout,"Probably one of the best movie I've seen in my life. We often the talk about the GOAT status in sport but I think this movie enforces the ideas at least in my head that Clint Eastwood is the GOAT of Hollywood. Thank you for this movie and very thing you did. It was a stellar performance by Hillary and Morgan should be awarded just for his voice. A pure pleasure.

10 February 2005,Emperor's new clothes,"I found the film extremely disappointing, my expectations having been fuelled by all the hype surrounding its release. I find it difficult to understand why it has received any awards, when looking beyond a superficial emotional level. This is a film about values and relationships and as such it fails badly. The characters should have been important and they are merely stereo-types uttering inane, over-sentimental clichés. The story line is predictable and telegraphed in advance in case we miss anything. There is no subtlety and we are left wanting to know more about important background issues that would have given the characters some depth. The actors are going through the motions of previous roles; there is nothing new in any of the performances. I will take the time to read the story upon which the film is based and it may be that the source material is the weak spot, in which case it has been poorly adapted and the result is a film that is sadly lacking in the qualities to raise it to the levels at which it is being pitched. I feel the industry should be ashamed to be heaping accolades on such a shabby, ponderous bathos-ridden work that clearly fails to hit the mark.

20 January 2005,"All the necessities of Great, but obviously placed","After reading a few reviews on both sides, I decided to go because the award nominations have been numerous and The Aviator is another erroneous overrated Scorcese biopic starring DiCaprio (and Gangs of NY was overrated as well). But anyway, I really enjoyed this film. You ultimately believed the stories and characters, the mood and pace were genuine, and there were 3 or 4 scenes that were really top-notch. And the studio mostly kept their hands off the movie, including the finish.

Despite the genuine heart and reality of the movie, it did have it's flaws. The lighting was unrealistic and frustrating to a point. The dialog was cheap and easy. The characters were never introduced beyond superficial archetypes. They should have had more ""everyday"" situations to show we weren't in some fantasy-land - which appeared to be both in the 1960's South as well as modern L.A. - and fewer scenes of Bad-Guy Set-up.

The fairly crowded house for an Art-House theater on a Wednesday night clapped, cried overtly, and mostly stayed talking until the credits were finished. I'd take Finding Neverland as best picture, but Million Dollar Baby is quite close. Bravo to Eastwood for his current directing skills and for his entire varied career.",
13 February 2005,Almost a masterpiece,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

9 January 2005,Spread too thin,"It's hard for me to say exactly why I hated this movie. Hate may be a strong word, but I was angry with this movie and I will try here to explain exactly why.

This is one of those movies that seems to be trying too hard to pack in drama and, in doing so, it spreads itself too thin. I can identify what I would call three main plots of the movie. Frank's (Clint Eastwood) personal struggle with his past, Maggie's (Hillary Swank) struggle (with Eastwood's help) to become a champion boxer, and Maggie's struggles after the title fight. A good deal of time is spent developing all three, and, while they all work, I find that the movie packs too many knockout punches. One might think that these plots along with good performances by the actors would lead to a very poignant movie, but I find that it tries to hard. The movie doesn't seem to know what it is. It is a Rocky story (albeit with a girl this time), it's about an old man struggling with demons, it's about a girl struggling to overcome physical obstacles. We've, of course, seen all these before, and this is not enough in itself to make me hate the movie, but each plot is not told in enough detail. Maggie is a natural once she gets a little help from Frank. Frank constantly beats himself up over his daughter, but we never find out exactly why. There's Maggie's family, an over the top white trash ""hillbilly"" family that seems hellbent on being worthless and self-serving. We understand why Maggie wanted badly to get out, but we don't really know what lead her to be a boxer.

There's Morgan Freeman, whose job it is in this movie to help Frank and Maggie develop as characters, he has no real story of his own. I can get into movies that are less than uplifting, but this movie was ridiculous.

It was good, but not great, and, frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.",
5 June 2005,I could not believe it..,"I saw this movie recently and with all the high praises (and Oscars) that its gotten i was really very excited to see this film, especially since i'm a boxing fan. However, by the end of the movie i was wondering if i saw the same movie everyone was talking about. To be honest i was disappointed with it. For a casual fan the boxing aspects of the movie might be okay but for a boxing aficionado they are not.. There are things happening (esp. inside the ring) on the movie that are simply unbelievable, you might even say its out of the world, and for that its just hard to love this movie. Now i'm sure people will point out that this is not a movie about boxing; this is a movie about People, about Relationships, and i get that. The thing is boxing is what holds the movie together, from the principal characters to the main scenes, and i just wish it was done better and realistically. PS I can't believe this won the Oscars for the best picture.

27 November 2015,It's good story what brings up your feeling of loving life,"Write before watch it.

About cast:

The director is Clint Eastwood. And he also performed in this movie. Hmm, interesting. Then I did some research, and found out he did the same thing before — directing and performing in the same movie — in Gran Torino. That's pretty cool!

This movie won the best picture of the year, 2005, as well as best directing in Oscar. So the Eastwood as a director may be doing a good job! And also, as an actor, Eastwood also get dominated as well. That's awesome!

The screenplay writer is Paul Haggis. He writes for both TV series and movies. He is famous for writing for this movie, Million Dollar Baby(2004), and two 007 movies: Casino Royale(2006), Quantum of Solace(2008). And he got dominated!

It won best leading actress performance, by Hillary Swank. But I don't know who she is..

It also won best supporting actor performance. Morgan Freeman took it. And it's the only one he got awards. The other four are only dominated.

Also, the editor got dominated! He's Joel Cox, edited in Prisoners(2013), Gran Torino(2008) and this one Million Dollar Baby(2004).

About the story:

Quote from IMDb, ""A determined woman works with a hardened boxing trainer to become a professional."" That's pretty simple.

So I guess the genre would be only Drama. It's about boxing, so it's also Sport. But before that, we already have Rocky(1976), and The Fighter(2010) etc. What makes this one outstanding? Though I haven't watched the other two..

Last word:

My doubt is, how to watch/analyze the editing of a movie? In the words, what makes them good or bad?

So let's begin.

After I watched it:

Clint Eastwood actually is good at acting, far better than I thought. So I did some more research on him. And he really rocks!

Directed American Sniper (2015), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), got dominated in best motion picture and best directing; Directed and performed in this one, Million Dollar Baby (2005), got dominated in best motion picture, best directing and best performing; Directed in Mystic River (2003), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed and performed in Unforgiven (1993), got dominated in best motion picture and best performance.

God this guy is a rock star!

Second thing, I keep thinking what is film, and how they are supposed to be. Someone told me, that watching a movie is more like experience a different life (yes even it's in that two hours). If it's true, then the only standard to test all the things in a movie is whether it can bring us into that 'life' or say that feeling. Actors and actress' performance, costume, makeup, decoration, photographing and editing, the of course directing.

So, without all the fast-pacing action scenes, mysteries, unnatural elements, I always wondered why drama movies keep attracting audience, and how. Then it turns out that it might be the similar feeling in this genre of movies that brings up our feeling or memory. And that happens to the most important quality of a movie, according to what says above. But of course, it needs a good story and a good director.

This one is really worth recommending to those who love lifes.",9
16 December 2007,This movie is horrible,"if this is a spoiler i am sorry ... it is not intending to be because i will not give out any specifics on anything... i am only here to say that this movie sucked so badly and horribly that i wanted to punch Clint Eastwood in the face for making such a hideous movie if no one told the viewers that this movie was a tragedy.... i am SO sorry you wasted your time on this piece of crap film..

i can't believe anyone would want to showcase something so hideously screwed up with the worst ending ever imaginable don't waste your time, money or bandwidth on this foul stink

girl wants to be a boxer, girl finds coach... girl enters contests...girl does good... now so as not to contain what i think are spoilers then everything that is horribly wrong or screwed up in society and what could happen to a person does happen and no one will go home happy after this viewing",1

19 July 2005,I think...,"I think (strange but I do) this movie is a good movie for its realism, and it's not really a movie which you could put the Hollywood's brand on, because something has been solved (the discovering of a legendary ""National Treasure""), but describes a real rough situation, where mostly everyone of us has passed in life, even unconsciously. I believe this is a good movie. But I don't think is helpful in any teachings. It may tell us how a simple and mostly lonely man can deal with the toughest decision. But after that anyone of us may just get out of the theater hoping not to go through anything like that.

That is the defeat of our era. Probably Eastwood has been so great in singling out this fat worm in our shiny apple.

Because the ones who come out of the theater thinking the movie had a serene (maybe melancholy but serene) ending, probably didn't get there is tragic situation in the end, a continuous remorse which will always knock on everyone's door, and the only question is ""how can we prevent it?""

I don't know if Eastwood wanted people to question about themselves, probably He just wanted to show us in reality there are some really uneasy human case.",

26 February 2005,incredible 27 days!!!,"it's incredible how such a great movie of that caliber can be made in 27 days. thats what happens when u have over 40 years of movie experience, clint eastwood that is. he proves himself again to be a consistent director with 2 Oscar winin movies 2 years in a row. Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank were also amazin. It did have a lot of errors if you realize, so did Lost In Translation which was made in few days also but you saw the Oscars it won. Still it deserves to beat the Aviator in my opinion because it was just amazin. Movies that are made in 27 days , all you need for that recipe is good actors who are experienced and a good plot. I was Shocked when i heard it was made in only a few days. All the Preparation for The Aviator took more than a year and it still had fatal errors in the movie, like not payin enough attention to WW2 and payin too much attention to the movie career of howard Hughes.. I hope Million Dollar Baby wins best picture. 9/10

30 July 2005,100% Eastwood,"I should say we all were probably thinking that the film went deeper into the story than we probably imagined. Clint tends to go 1 or 2 chapters further into these elements the older (and wiser) he gets. His direction is stellar as always and Morgan Freeman plays his constrained role with his usual deftness. I have to say that the only thing I knew about this movie before I saw it (on video) was that it garnered many awards and that Clint directed it. Hillary Swank immersed herself in the story and was true to her character, well deserving of the accolades. I don't know what else to write without a spoiler so I'll just include a suggestion, ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"". Ate logo.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",1
17 May 2005,Disappointing,"I really wanted to love this movie. After a very lackluster year I was hoping for a movie which would redeem the whole year for me. And after having read the overwhelmingly positive reviews and seen the Oscar landslide I really hoped this movies was it"". I love all the talent involved, so I was logically expecting a great movie with amazing performances of all the leads. What a disappointment! Now after having seen it I wonder why on Earth were movies like Finding Neverland"" or Kinsey"" so drastically"" overlooked last year. The story of Million Dollar Baby"" is totally uninteresting and I did not care for any of the characters (with perhaps the exception of Freeman's character: it might have been a much better movie if it had concentrated on his character). There was nothing either in the performances or the direction which would make me really emotionally invested in the movie. Clint Eastwood is utterly unconvincing in his part, Hilary Swank has nothing to play (though she is very convincing as a boxer), but any actress willing to play without a make-up could be equally good in the part, I guess. Only Morgan Freeman sparks up some interest with his performance, but he has very little screen time. As for Clint Eastwood's direction: it seems his only specific approach to direction was to make the characters move in the dark for the most part of the movie. Not enough, Clint! So, if you want to see a good movie for 2004, watch Finding Neverland"" or Kinsey"" instead.",2
7 January 2013,no logic for the climax.,"the movie is missing the logic for the climax. in the final match she is hit from the back by her opponent. we see that she didn't win the match, so she was hit during the match. so why her experimented trainer, put the chair in the ring before the bell ? and in this case, we should see the guilt, not only a helpful and emphatic guy. the movie talks 90% of the time about the path of a champion, and almost nothing about the interior conflict after. it's a missed movie with a very good intrigue ( which comes only at the end). it is raised the problem of euthanasia, which is solved very quickly. before the climax there is the story of the stupid boxer who is beaten up buy his colleagues. it's irrelevant, has nothing to do with the main story

14 March 2005,Well Acted but FLAWED and OVERRATED,"***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT***

The acting in this film was impressive, but a few comments must be made. Seeing Freeman narrating another movie is a little too familiar for me. In addition, as good a job as Swank did (oscar is deserved), I do think it's a role that 10+ other actresses today could have done just as well. The role didn't ask for much in the way character development or introspection; it was most important that she came off as being a believable boxer.

I think think movie was good, not great, and my reasons are:

1- You can NEVER hit an opponent when they have a knee touching the canvas. If you do, you are immediately DQ'D (it happened to Roy Jones Jr a few years ago)...Maggie would have won the fight as soon as that happened (are we as viewer supposed to ignore the rules?) 2- Are we really to believe that a fighter wears a nickname on their back for a significant period of time, is referred to by that nickname numerous times, but does not know what it means? I know that she asks Franky many times what MO CHUISLE means, and this movie seems to take place in the 1980's or so (look of cars, rotary phones, etc..), but wouldn't an industrious person such as Maggie try and find out on here own---i know there is no internet, but perhaps a 10 minute trip to a local library? 3- The story line of Danger did nothing for me in and of itself, nor did it add to the story line--except to allow for closure for Eddie...pretty hokey for me. 4- Wouldn't Franky have reconnected the oxygen mask and turn the machine back on after he committed his last deed, so that the would avoid suspicion and possibly be accused of murder? 5- Are we really to believe that Maggie's white trash family is that despicable? Wouldn't they have latched on to Maggie after her new found professional and monetary success? I think these characters were too awful for the Jerry Springer Show

There are other points, but you get the picture. For me, a GREAT movie is one where I am not left with so many issues that are devoid of both common sense and reality.",
8 February 2005,"So emotionally manipulative, and yet...it was so well acted and directed that I liked it. 8/10","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

13 March 2005,Different than what I expected...,"Maggie Fitzgerald is determined to become a boxer and wants to be trained by Frankie Dunn. Frankie has never coached girls, but Scrap makes him change his mind. Maggie learns things quickly and starts advancing towards the boxing elite. Frankie and Maggie have never really had a proper family and as they keep training they become that to one another. In the end Maggie has to face something nothing has prepared her for...

As far as the story and the message, Million Dollar Baby was very different from what I was expecting. The first half of the movie was about the training and the fighting. A little after the middle the story turns upside down. The movie could be divided into two; the first half with the fights and training and the second half with the emotionally effective drama.

The first little detail that caught my eye was the amazing collision of light and shadow. Randomly lit dim rooms make a really interesting atmosphere. Eastwood has kept this same style through the whole movie. I hope the movies he will make in the future will be as much of a treat to the eye as this one. Eastwood has also directed the actors wonderfully.

Hilary Swank, the winner of the Oscar for actress in the leading role, is amazing. Her determined and energetic attitude really impressed me. Clint Eastwood offers his best performance since Unforgiven (1992). He creates a magnificent and emotionally moving atmosphere for the important drama parts near the end. Morgan Freeman is also really good. He got the Oscar for best actor in the supporting role. I agree with the academy's choice. He is the narrator of the movie and he really does it wonderfully (quite like in The Shawshank Redemption).

I think that the only problem with the movie is the striking plot twist. The movie changes completely. I loved the latter part of the movie, but the sudden change was maybe too dramatic.

The academy chose this for the best picture. I completely agree.",9
15 January 2005,disappointed,"million dollar was a huge disappointment...not because of the performances but because the plot line was so predictable.....the story melted into maudlin puddle...so predictable it became painful to watch...too bad so many talented people spent so much time on a movie that will nor endure.....eastwood again plays the torn up torn apart family except this time it does not work--perhaps this movie was too easily praised and written about by those who upon reflection will realize that their early knee jerk reaction misguided.....morgan freeman's performance was good but the character a bit trite....swank was engaging....eastwood had an interesting character but again it was too much

31 January 2005,A Impressive Movetive Movie,"when i knew what ""MoCuishle"" means, i dropped my tears. That naturalness is true. for all, it is a easily understood movie, not like the ""aviator"",neither the ""finding never land"", i love this kind of movies which are easy to understand and which have the normal people in them. this movie which at the last part change so sharply shocked me. all the time i saw this movie (of course the first time) we thought that it would end up happily. but it shocked me! at the end! the coach kill the fighter.but we have to admit that that end is super good! but the film ""aviator"" id not a good movie for the people who are not Americans.

5 March 2005,"Very good, but Mystic River was better","I really liked Million Dollar Baby, but what bothers me is that Mystic River was way better in every way but because of LORD OF THE RINGS, it didn't get the recognition it deserved at the Oscars last year. OK, Million Dollar is a beautifully written, somber, dark, drama but I don't think it was the best film of the year (AVIATOR). I found it a bit predictable with too many hints and foreshadowing in the film for the ending. The cinematography was perfect, but Morgan Freeman has been way better in other roles (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory and Shawshank). His quiet, expressionless janitor role won him an Oscar for obvious political reasons (he never won before). I think I'm just bitter that Million Dollar won the top awards such as best actress, director and picture. Sorry but how hard can it be to direct two other people and a few extras compared to Scorsese's work in the Aviator? Also Kate Winslet's performance in ETERNAL SUNSHINE was much more Oscar-worthy than the boyish-playing Hillary Swank which seems to be the only thing she's good at.. (Boys Don't Cry). WOW, she gained muscle, give her the Oscar!!! Million Dollar Baby is a great film but in all fairness, Eastwood's Mystic River was way better and I'm just bummed that Million Dollar has gotten more of the credit.",6
6 March 2005,Good movie with several statements to make.,"Hilary Swank does a great job of acting. Clint Eastwood is Clint Eastwood as both actor and director. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman as he was in ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"". It seems to give a pro vote for euthanasia, but we do treat our favorite pets much better than we do our human friends when it comes to relieving suffering. The physical, personal damage portrayed by the sport of boxing may be too much for some small children, most females and some males. If you liked the ""Raging Bull"" then that will probably not bother you. It is also a very true portrayal of many people that are on the welfare roles of this country. See the movie early in the day so as to help not keeping you awake at night thinking about it.

12 March 2018,My #1 favorite movie of all time,"I don't tend to write reviews, and certainly not about something I feel so strongly about. I feel that my emotions prevent me from giving an unbiased review. But I wanted to make this exception because I've read too many reviews comparing this movie to Rocky.

There's boxing in the movie, and that's where the similarities to Rocky ends. This movie is about the love of a father for his daughter. This movie is about living a life you can feel proud of. The boxing is incidental.

If you are looking for a sports movie, move along. If you are looking for a deep, emotional roller coaster ride, this movie is for you.

8 March 2005,If this is the best the Oscars can do...,"If this is the best that the Oscars can come up with then they really should be trying harder...

On the whole a quite boring film, and I do like Clint Eastwood as a rule.

The story held nothing new, and although the acting was okay, there was nothing about the film as a whole that would make you recommend it.

Don't fret though Clint, the other Oscar top shot 'The Aviator' was just as bad!

Hey guys, why not try making some truly original films, instead of just rehashing old ideas into tired old mediocrity.

Take a look at some of the films being made in Europe (and I have no doubt elsewhere in the USA, Hollywood excepted), there are some outstandingly original films being made.

7 April 2005,Blatant missed opportunity,"Hilary Swank is a great talent. This realization is my only reward from this long movie. The basic flaw is familiar: The Tendency of Hollywood and the Oscar-arena features to avoid anything resembling subtle gestures. The basic idea of the script is to explore the potentialities of a relationship between a man who lost his daughter (for a reason unknown to us) and carries a great void within himself, and a woman who lost her father and carries the pain of his absence as it is cruelly mirrored through the grotesque selfishness of the rest of her family. So far so good. But why make everything so explicit? So obvious? The critical and crucial subject of the intersection between fathers-daughters on the one hand and woman-man on the other hand provides so many roads to riddles, complications,and liberating insights. But here, all we have are obvious caricatures. Moreover, these are almost explicitly gendered, as the whole frame is that of women dependency and male desire for control, although of course the trajectory is towards a kind of salvation, in the form of male softness. and there is too much boxing...

22 December 2008,Baffled at the rave reviews of this movie,"I've never been so dumbfounded by the rave response a movie has received than this. Did a high school drama student write this? Oh, it was Clint wasn't it? Yaaawwwwn. Unbelievably under-utilized talent because of an unbelievably amateurish, two-dimensional script. Is there any complexity or depth to any of the characters? No. To the story? No. HIllary Swank's character--the average girl from humble origins with grand ambitions. Despite how boring her character is, we are supposed to love her for her plucky spirit, and of course because of those awful, unloving parents she has. That's about all we can say for her, because that's as developed as this great actress is allowed to get with this horribly empty story and script. Clint is, well, Clint, as usual--the curmudgeonly boxing club owner who's hiding a big heart. Freeman, the wise older black man who has seen it all, and calmly narrates the story, yet whom we are to believe is content with his position, living in an 8x8 room in a stinky boxing gym. Freeman can't hide his intelligence and his greatness in such a shabby role as this--it just doesn't ring true. Swank as well, must've had to dumb herself down. I imagine it was absolutely no challenge at all for any of them to perform these vapid roles, and that Hillary Swank took much more pleasure in being recognized for her much more demanding Boys Don't Cry role. Perhaps Clint forgets that REAL actors require more complex characterizations than Dirty Harry.",5
17 April 2006,i just can't understand why...,"This is not a outstanding movie!! This is not an Oscar movie!! I just can get it: Hillary Swank got the Oscar for what? She is a great actress, alright, but not in this movie! And why did Morgan Freeman (one of my favorite actors, don't get me wrong...) wan the Oscar? He doesn't even talk in he entire movie!! The only actor who really deserved the Oscar was Clint Eastwood, but he could't compeet with Jamie Fox in ""Ray""...

Paul Haggis's script is great, but the directing is not worth of an Oscar!!! Please, if you really think this is a great movie, tell me WHY. I just can't get it.

18 July 2005,Thirty something female boxer seeks trainer who will take her to the top,"Clint Eastwood's character is likable in this movie and Hilary Swank makes you fall in love with her character. But in my mind the real star of the movie is Jay Baruchel (who's character) was almost a story within a story. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood's and love a lot of his movies that he's acted in. However it seems that the movies he directs are always very dark and un-redemptive. Unforgiven was also dark, but it had the backdrop of the old west and somehow that's more palatable to me. There are many things that are hard to swallow in this movie when you think them over. But I think the main thing that disagreed with me is how the movie starts out so inspiring and then takes a dark turn. With an outcome that is unnecessary. It seems to me that a true fighter would always want to fight. I will not give away the ending. I do believe it is a mistake to compare this movie to Shawshank Redemption like some critics have. Morgan Freeman's character was way more dry and melodramatic in this movie.

Just keep concentrate on the thing and try harder to achieve what you want. Your continuous efforts for certain goal will lead you to get whatever you desire. We in life go through many tough times but our hope for better days never dies which gives us the courage to remain alive.. and only those survive who word hard for what they deserve. Movie is beautifully directed and the story line was also good. The end of the story was really tragic but really incredible..

26 July 2018,Good influence,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10
23 October 2019,A must watch for any film student.,"I ofter wonder what makes a movie ""great"". I have come to the conclusion that a great movie does not answer all of the questions and leaves the audience to decide the answers and it leaves a mark as in it is memorable. Million Dollar Baby is all of these things. I have to say that this is a movie that I will not actively seek out to watch again because it was very hard to watch. 10/10 It is a MUST WATCH for any film student at least once.

16 November 2005,Very close to the bone - classic Hollywood cinema,"First of all: ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a movie about boxing (neither are ""Raging Bull"" or ""Hurricane"", for that matter). Every film needs a setting, and the setting of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (adapted from several short stories by F. X. Toole) just happens to be the boxing world. Of course, there are a couple of rather violent fight scenes, but, as in all of the truly great 'boxing-movies', these are only a necessary means for telling a story that is about something completely different and much more universal.

In the first scene, which happens to be one of the aforementioned fighting scenes, there is an impressive close-up shot of an open wound  a cut in a boxer's face, close to his eye  that defines the theme for the rest of the film. This is, indeed, a story about open wounds. Frankie (Clint Eastwood), a veteran boxing trainer, was once known as the best cut-man around  an expert in treating such wounds in boxer's faces. Ironically, he lacks expertise when it comes to taking care of his own (psychological) wounds. Some cuts, it is said at one time in the film, are just too deep or too close to the bone.

Frankie lives alone. For some reason his daughter, apparently the only remaining member of his family, has deserted him and returns all of his letters unopened. All he has left is his business, an L.A.-based boxing gym crowded with some real fighters and a whole load of wannabes. His life suddenly changes when his long-time companion and ex-protégé Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the narrator, discovers Maggie (Hillary Swank) among the many seedy characters in the gym. Maggie, a 31-year-old, uneducated, lower working class woman  ""trailer trash from the Ozarks"", as she puts it herself  wishes to be trained by Frankie and become a professional fighter so she can break the cycle of her unsatisfactory life and support her family. At first Frankie is skeptical; he's opposed to the idea of training a woman, and he obviously doesn't want to be involved in any way with a woman about the age of his daughter. But after a while, persuaded by Maggie and Scrap as well, he agrees and, of course, Maggie becomes one of the most successful fighters worldwide.

In boxing, it is said, the final round is the hardest (that is, of course, unless one of the two fighters gets knocked out before that). The same thing is true for Eastwood's movie, which takes another abrupt turn towards the end, when after a drastic incident Maggie and Frankie's world is turned upside down once more and everything that seemed certain is in question again. It is up to Frankie now to make one more fateful decision.

On the surface ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the clichés and stereotypes: the loser who, through a metamorphosis achieved by hard practice, turns into the ultimate success (Maggie); the veteran mentor who has been through almost everything and has a hell of a time coping with all his grief (Frankie); the streetwise, somewhat poetic observer/adviser/narrator  blind in one eye  who serves as a moral authority (""Scrap""); the outright ridiculous and disgusting hillbilly clan (Maggie's family); and even a rather bizarre version of the terrifying, evil foreigner (Billie, the black, ex-prostitute, fighter from East-Berlin, played by real-life boxer Lucia Rijker). It is its frank and modest tone above all(just pay some attention to the sparse use the editors made of music and sound effects) that saves the film from being just another shallow and cheesy affair, and allows viewers take an interest in the characters' development and the outcome of the story, which can be said to raise more questions than it is able to answer.

Essentially, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an American story, the first half driven by a lively from-rags-to-riches or you-can-get-it-if-you-really-want mentality (furthered by constantly drawing on certain myths of the boxing world), the second half dominated by an atmosphere of absolute doubt. Clint Eastwood, along with screenwriter Paul Haggis, has created an outstanding piece of classic Hollywood cinema, dialogue-driven and simple in style. Highly recommended, not only for fans of boxing or movies about boxing!",8
20 December 2005,"Cheap Manipulative Direction Blinds Audiences to Horrible Acting, Writing","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a ""cut man"" who manages a gym with the help of his friend, Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who now is blind in one eye and lives in the gym in addition to working as the janitor. Scrap narrates the story of Frankie and Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and as the movie begins, Maggie approaches Frankie after a fight, hoping that he'll agree to become her manager. Frankie refuses because she is a girl and too old to begin fighting. None of this matters to Maggie, though, who is determined to rise above her trailer-trash background and become a champion. Without any prior training, she joins Frankie's gym and practices their every day.

As the story moves on, Scrap takes sympathy on Maggie and teaches her a few tricks about how to hit a punching bag. She displays some talent and Frankie reluctantly decides to become her manager. The two form a bond as Maggie begins winning fights and it becomes clear that their relationship moves well beyond the ring and into the realm of a surrogate family. Frankie starts to occupy the place of her dead father and Maggie fills in for Frankie's estranged daughter.

This is, more or less, how the first half of the film plays out. There are some major flaws with the film so far, most notably Eastwood's performance. Trying to present Frankie as a tough guy, he hoarsens his voice and furrows his brow only to deliver one of the most one-note performances in his entire career. Even more infuriating, though, is the lack of understanding Eastwood displays for Frankie. I find it interesting when a character who attends Mass daily is unable to cross himself correctly before his nightly prayers. Another irritating element of Frankie's character is the story of his daughter. We are kept in the dark about why his daughter refuses to speak with him, no doubt because the filmmakers want us to draw our own conclusion. The backstory is far too important to Frankie for us to be kept from us. Suppose he abused her as a child or was an illegitimate father who didn't know she existed until late in life. These different scenarios have massive repercussions on him and his relationship with Maggie.

But it isn't just Eastwood's acting that fails to deliver. Morgan Freeman is also awful. His line readings are so difficult to understand that I spent most of my time trying to determine whether he is acting or impersonating a vacuum cleaner. On the rare occasion when Scrap's narration is actually decipherable, it comes off as pointlessly poetic--suggesting that screenwriter Paul Haggis, adapting from F.X. Toole's ""Rope Burns,"" is unaware of the fact that Scrap is an uneducated man living in a gym. The pair of bad performances just adds to the preposterous string of victories Maggie racks up. Really, why should I believe that a woman that has received only a couple months worth of training is going to slaughter better trained, younger athletes?

Yet, despite these flaws, Hilary Swank's sincere turn almost makes the first hour worth viewing. Swank does a magnificent job of conveying a determined fighter, who has no disillusionments about how miserable her life will be if she doesn't succeed as a boxer. In fact, there are two scenes that are especially effective. The first is when Scrap teaches Maggie how to work a punching bag, the second is on her birthday when Frankie starts to train her. Not only does Swank deliver a fine performance, but also numerous technical aspects of the production are impressive. Tom Stern's cinematography uses shadows to great effect and Henry Bumstead's production design delivers an elegant setting.

The film quickly moves from being flawed to being reprehensible. How so many people can look at what happens during the second half and think of it as being truthful is beyond me. When the half-blind, sixty-something Scrap walks into a ring and knocks out a vibrant, twenty-something boxer, the scene belongs in a ""Three Stooges"" movie. Even more irritating is a sequence when Maggie and Frankie visit her family. Her mother and sister are the epitome of backwoods hillbillies. Maggie's attempts at giving her mom a nice house are met with hostility, because it will make it impossible for her mom to cheat the welfare system. Stereotyping of this type is both wrong and unnecessary. The audience is already sympathetic to Maggie, so we don't need to be manipulated any further by her uncaring family. If the Fitzgerald's were black, I can only imagine the outrage that would ensue over the depiction of this family. Fortunately for all involved, everybody likes to take a swipe at ""white trash.""

Of course there's another plot twist that received much controversy when Michael Medved and Rush Limbaugh revealed it in order to further their own agendas. Numerous people castrated them for revealing the specifics of the plot, but since the twist happens with 40 minutes left in the film, it is only fair to tell people the general path the film takes. I won't reveal the exact nature of the twist, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a female-""Rocky."" Instead, it turns into a euthanasia drama. Fair enough, since it's an important topic and many movies incorporate it into the plot. Yet the exact nature of how it is explored is poorly plotted and unbearably divorced from reality. I feel an obligation not to reveal any spoilers from this section of the film, which limits my ability to fully explain my objections to it. Nonetheless, I can safely relay that Eastwood's direction and Haggis' script do not even attempt to present realistic medical procedures. Not only that, but upon reflection, the decisions made by the characters are not consistent with the rest of their behavior. After years of being one of America's top auteurs, perhaps it is time for Eastwood to hang up his gloves.",4

It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

18 June 2005,the power...,"Eastwood has done it again...What Unforgiven was for the 90's, 'Million dollar baby' marks the year 2004-2005. The acting is fantastic, with a very realistic and exciting Morgan Freeman on top. He shows so much feeling in his character, you almost think he isn't acting one bit. It would be a great mistake to call this the female 'Rocky' movie. Rocky is a whole different movie. In this movie, the fighting doesn't conquer the whole film. Eastwood had some minor films in the last years (Space cowboys!), like True crime and the mediocre thriller 'Blood work', but he clearly shows to never underestimate an old fox. Very smart of him, to play the roles that are meant for the 'oldtimers'. Next year he is directing 'Flags of our fathers'..Curious what he'll do with that one...

28 February 2005,"Wasn't that good, but not terrible","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

10 May 2012,Excellent film,"It isn't often I give a film 10 out of 10! There isn't an ""E"" in the film title, so I can't make the second rate joke of ""The E must stand for excellent"" so I'm thinking of doing ""The M must be for magnificence"". This film came out in 2004, and even though I consider myself pretty up to date on modern films/films that contain the grizzled bear-like head of Clint Eastwood, I didn't get around to watching it until 2009. I know if there is one thing I like to see in user reviews, it is a little bit of background story. I was at a gig where a load of punk bands were playing, but my girlfriend got too drunk and wanted to go home. We went to hers to watch a film. The bus journey was average, definitely not as good at this film, which is MAGNIFICENT. I wanted to watch the film ""Willow"" but as it wasn't available for eye-tasting at that exact juncture, we searched for another DVD. We found this film and decided to throw it on. We only saw about ten minutes of it, and then I got a blow job. I saw fleeting moments of the film when my eyes opened was I neared climax. I thought this was supposed to be a sad film, but it got me some suck suck. Definitely recommend. It is clearly a babe magnet. 20/10.",10
15 July 2005,Very very good!!,"This is one of the best boxing movies so far. Aside from the thrill of the battle in the ring, it also entails a drama in the later part of the movie. It is a good combination and the good part is unlike rest of the boxing or fight movies, (except for raging bull which is a lifestory of a boxer), our hero doesn't win the final fight and reach the happy ending. This adds reality with a little bit of surprise. However, the boxing scenes of the movie is a little far from realistic. The punches are very accurate and strong. It reminds us the series ""Rocky"". The one-round knockouts are seriously far from reality (Hillary Swan does not really look like Mike Tyson, does she?). But as it gets closer to a real boxing bout, where punches are hardly on target, and where it takes rounds (most of the time it goes to decision, since these boxers are light weight) to win the match, it will get boring so this is the usual drawback of all the boxing movies, and must be accepted. Another thing is, after the injury, as we know she will never get up and fight again, and the story will end sad, some viewers may find the last 40 minutes slow and boring. Also our hero is presented as a very nice positive person. Life as everybody else is unfair to her. Her mother nearly hates her, all she thinks is her money even after the injury, thats a little too much. The ""bad woman boxer"" is also way out of boundaries of boxing and reality. Punching while the opponent is down? hitting clearly with an elbow? the last match was more like a UFC bout. No refs will allow that much, nobody with that consistent behavior may hold a title. If Clint Eastwood had watched more box matches before shooting the movie it could have been better. Against all these, this movie made its place in my memory.",8
29 January 2005,"Slow, but good","I really shouldn't say anything bad about this movie, but being a movie fan I have to criticize things. I guess the only complaint I would have about this movie is the slow start to it, but I guess this kind of movie needs a slow start. Once the movie started to pick up, it just got incredible! I love movies that in which you never know where exactly it is going. I would definitely agree with those who have told me that this movie looks like you know what it's going to turn into, a movie about a someone coaching a real contender to being the champ, but completely turns out differently. I don't want to ruin the ending to anyone who hasn't seen this movie and is planning to see but, but I'm going to forewarn... BE PREPARED! If you are a classic Clint Eastwood fan, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! If you're not... SEE IT ANYWAY!

18 March 2006,truly excellent,"although i wanted to catch the movie in theater last year when it was released in mumbai,i couldn't since i was preparing for my exams. and now i know it was a good decision not to watch the movie then because i am sure i would have spent at least one whole week thinking about it.

i saw this movie yesterday on my TV set in the afternoon when i didn't have anyone else at home to disturb me.when the movie ended i was crying like a baby.but the magic of the movie was long lasting and so at least for the next 6 hours i didn't manage to do anything else than cry , just couldn't stop replaying the movie again and again in my mind.

i am into all those romantic sort of movies bu million dollar movie now wears he crown for being my favorite movie above all.

15 January 2005,Forget the Hype- It's a Contender- But It's No Heavyweight Champ!,"I'm a little torn about this movie. first- i was a bit disappointed as i did buy into the hype surrounding it- after all Eastwood and Freeman together again? Boxing buddies instead of cowboys? sounded and looked like a sure winner. add to that the young female lead, Hillary Swank as a strong independent woman boxer to contrast the two old guys and the appeal just increased.

however- Million Dollar Baby is in no way this years A Beautiful Mind.

not even close.

don't get me wrong- it's a well made drama which uses some time honored recipes of film-making to make it's points but that's about all it is. there is little outstanding here. story, acting, direction- it's all been seen and done before. I'm not saying it was done badly, just previously. additionally- the boxing here is very poorly choreographed, nearly all of the actors come off looking cartoonish as they punch. i've seen many women's pro and amateur boxing matches- and the choreography here does those athletes little justice.

I do however give a nod to Ms. Swank as she pulled off her role as the 30-something trailer park trash-turned boxer very well. she was honest and believable and outshone her two co-stars, who looked like their UNFORGIVEN characters thrust into uncomfortable clothing.

think of Million Dollar Baby as ROCKY meets Brian's Song and you won't be too far off, except here Rocky doesn't win the title and Gayle Sayers becomes just another Joe.

It is a sad story, with very sad characters. but the scenes that should leave you wrenching your heart out leave you looking for the last few doritos in the bottom of the bag. the crumbs you get taste good- but they're just not the real thing.

the script is very well written and i did like the voice-over narration of Freeman, it was a nice touch.

Overall, I say a 7.5 out of 10. definitely worth watching, but not the Oscar-Sweeper everyone is saying it is.",
24 November 2013,That girl...,"I don't know what i say about this film, makes me cry and proud of that girl like her father :) I just wish, that boxer girl didn't hit Maggie, i would appreciate that but this the movie that's happening in every film. But this movie better than the others.

The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert. This is an excerpt from larryg5...

8 January 2005,Inspirational,"This movie hasn't gotten the hype that it rightfully deserves. A HIGHLY inspirational movie, whether you box, row boats, sell insurance ... it's motivating.

Taking zero skill and making dreams become reality ... the message hits home reinforcing the viewer that anything you put your mind to is achievable.

Finding love when and where you least expect it.

Hilary Swank's performance in this film was phenomenal. Clint Eastwood outstanding and Morgan Freeman somehow always knew the right thing to say at the right time.

27 February 2005,"Great, but could have been better","This was one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I watch quite a few. The movie was put together well and, perhaps, its only shortcoming was that there was not enough time for good character development. I would have liked to know more about Frankie. He was the main character, yet I feel like I don't know him. I need to know more details about his life to feel what he feels, especially in the end. Maggie could have been better filled-out as well. I would have especially liked to know more about what she did before she met Frankie. All in all this is a great movie, though, and I will regard it as one of Eastwood's best.

10 March 2005,Is it really the best picture of 2004?,"No. I've seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and enjoyed it very much, but does it deserve the attention it's getting? Sure Clint Eastwood organized the production very well, his acting was okay, and his score didn't sound too bad either (one of those nice chicken-pecking piano tunes), but was the production as a whole better than that of ""The Aviator""? This comment centers on this year's Academy Awards more than it does the film. Honestly and deeply in my soul I ask myself this question once again ""Has the Academy lost its mind?"" My interpretation of what is most likely best picture of the year is the one that succeeds on the widest variety of factors. ""The Aviator"", nominated for eleven awards actually competing against ""Million Dollar Baby"" (7 nominations)? This should be one of those obvious landslides like Titanic was in '97 or ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" should have been in '01. I'm so sick of members of the Academy voting for who they think DESERVES an Oscar over who did the best job. Take Morgan Freeman for example. Poor Scorsese. Honest recognition is so hard to find these days.

3 August 2006,"Very good movie, except the ending","I never saw this movie in the theater or when it came out on video because I heard it wasn't very good, but tonight I was bored and decided since nothing else was on I would give it a shot. Just goes to show that you can't believe everything people say. It was a great movie, one of my favorites that I have seen in a long time. The only problem I had with the movie, was that the ending was a little disappointing. I thought that Maggie and Frankies characters totally defied themselves at the end. Maggie was such a fighter in the movie, it was really hard to just picture her giving up and wanting to die. I thought it was absolutely counter to the line where she said ""she came into this world fighting and would leave fighting"", because she didn't fight at all, she gave up. I thought it also sent a bad message to people with disabilities, not that every movie needs to make some kind of moral crusade, but if we are to believe that Maggie was so strong and such a fighter, then it sends a message that here is the best and toughest and she is giving up. What kind of message does that send to ordinary people with less strength? I don't know if this was some kind of crusade from Clint about the Merits of Euthanasia, but I think it hurt the story and tarnished Maggie just a little bit in the end. I understand that it was adapted from a book, but it would have been much better and more true to Maggies character to just have her die.

Never the less it was still a very moving movie. Hillary Swank is a brilliant actress, and the directing of Clint was very good on this film, very good atmosphere, just a disappointing ending.",
4 February 2005,Oscars for all involved!,"Simply put, this film is a death-defying, as well as life-affirming treatise on the so-called, ""Child-Gladiator-Bovine"" triad, recently popularized in Tibetan ""slam cafés"".

A reach, I suppose. But I stand by it. We must always stand by words which have served us. It is the servers that serve automation. These protocols have no other mothers. Let machine language recognizers do all the fruit punching. Unix is the real Million Dollar Baby. Let us all worship the God of automation and productivity. There are no writers, only self-starting euphemisms.

In conclusion, let me just state that Clint Eastwood's latest effort is plainly superior to the strikingly similar, but lessor-known 1982 Tibetan slam café expose, ""Raging Cow.""

14 July 2005,This one will stay with you for days..,"What I loved: Maggie was truly a diamond found in a mountain of broken glass. She was sweet, tough, cute, and passionate. The boxing scenes were realistic and nothing was glorified. Everyone seemed down to earth. What a great feeling! What I didn't like: The last 45 minutes could have been reduced down to 20 minutes and the other 25 minutes could have been made up with showing more of her training. We didn't see enough of Clint teaching her everything he knows. The bonding and father/daughter relationship doesn't necessarily develop from her knocking everyone out, but would grow through the countless days of training to become that champ.

Also, Maggie won that fight. Blue Bear would have been DQed, but that was never addressed. I wanted to see Magie's belt hanging over her bed. And I guess her money ended up going to her family since that wasn't addressed either. Lastly, in the very end he told her that her nickname meant ""My Darling, My Blood."" That was really sweet and tender, but why didn't he tell her that he loved her? As Maggie said, ""no one told me that they loved me since my daddy."" I thought that was a little foreshadowing, but I was wrong.

The movie went from Feel Good to Feel Bad movie of the year and that was tough to deal with. However, this is the grim reality of life, whether we like it or not, we must face it. Maggie got her shot, thats all that mattered in the end..",8
31 August 2015,Alpha XTRM Vision Improvement Through,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",10

9 February 2017,A Flawless Movie,"Think about all of the things you could ever ask for in a movie, a short list of elements that makes a movie great would likely include: a love story, character struggle and then triumph, sport, comedic relief, and a meaningful story being told. Million Dollar Baby was able to capture all of these points and some. You could put Morgan Freeman's career up against anyone's in film history, comparing both acting chops and classic films said person was in; with that said, this is the best role of his career. Not only does he portray a great supporting character with depth, he also narrates the story of the movie as well. The Oscar he received for this role was a no-brainer. Going back to the love story element-- this movie doesn't follow the traditional romantic path, but one of a trainer and trainee. The audience watches this relationship build from one of pity to profound love. This movie will captivate you by asking you to root for the characters in this film, and profoundly effect you as you witness each of them develop-- and by the time the credits roll in you will realize that you have watched what quite possibly is the greatest movie of all time.",10
3 May 2018,Hambor 3b,"This movie was an all around great piece of work... The fact that Eastwood and Morgan Freeman teamed up to make such an amazing movie is phenomenal. With Clint Eastwood being one of the best directors of all time (IMO), some of the angles and scenes in this movie were a little less perfect then in others like his later films like American Sniper. For example, during fights, you can tell the director was trying to create tension by switching the angles rapidly, and also trying to put you in her shoes, almost like first person view. In conclusion, although some angles and scenes seemed a little Half-a**, the overall movie was a great experience.

19 July 2006,Highly overrated,"A year later and I'm still mad at the Academy because of their decision to give Clint Eastwood another couple of Oscars. Martin Scorsese is a master and 'Sideways' was obviously last year's greatest film (of course, ignored by stupid Oscar voters who cannot recognize subtle work! isn't it time to reduce the actors' branch to the half?!). The Academy's fondness for this overly sentimental, predictably manipulative, cheap tricks film is absolutely not understandable. The film has some beautifully shot, stylish moments, it shows that Clint has become a good craftsman and develops a good use of space but let's face, the film doesn't lacks depth. It's just a sentimental story (with an extremely successful third act, a working second act and an absurd first act). The film's performances simply don't lie on a terrific ground. All the characters are one-sided. Take Maggie - she's the angel who fights to escape the world where she's the poor girl of an unloving mother. To make us feel for her, writer Paul Haggis wrote that awfully unfair scene where her family comes to visit her simply to get her money. Even if that was their goal, the scene wasn't logical at all because they showed it so brutally and after all, I think that Maggie would need them and wouldn't do what she did. And Hilary's performance, though a really very good one, couldn't even be compared to Imelda Staunton in ""Vera Drake"" - a film that dared to show us that its lead character isn't simply a good-hearted woman but a woman who didn't even knew in what trouble she's going. And at the end, there's an aspect of the film I understand. It's the suicide at the very end. I can't understand why all the people who loved the film (and loved it obviously because of its sentimental ending) don't get that. There's a conversation when Maggie tells why she wants to die. And I accept her decision. It's maybe the emotional high point of such an emotionally uneven film, with uneven writing and uneven directing. And at the end, I simply want to tell that I don't understand why people are comparing this to Bergman. Bergman's depth and astonishing visuals came out of the characters and in this film everything's on the surface and absolutely as an end in itself. Some good visual moments, solid editing, great acting but both directing and writing took the wrong direction. If you want to be touched, watch ""Sideways"" - absolutely last year's best film.",4
10 September 2019,Mo chuisle fo' the pushle,"Mo chuisle fo' the pushle.

(I deduct half a point for the movie's incorrect spelling of ""chuisle."" ""Pushle"" is my coinage and I can spell it however I want.)

This movie took the conventional structure of a sports movie and flipped it on its head. The level of dedication on Hilary Swank's part was insane and she did amazing. I definitely cried a couple of times and I did not expect the ending at all. I appreciate the level of thought that went into creating a beautiful and tragic story. A must see! :)

19 March 2020,Million Dollar baby,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

4 April 2017,Change of Life in Seconds,"Could you imagine being surrounded by thousands of people, with all their attention focused on you? This is an amazing, passionate, movie that I recommend everyone to watch. It's something to learn from and never give up on your dreams on what your mind is set to do. Going into this movie I was expecting just a regular boxing movie—as if someone who is not the greatest at boxing overcomes a fighter they have wanted to overcome. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who owns a boxing gym that isn't at its best, who he runs the gym with his former student Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) which lives at the gym in a single room with all of his belongings. One regular day a lady named Maggie (Hilary Swank) walked in looking for a manager and trainer—who is my favorite character.

I wasn't expecting what happens in this movie. I expected the totally opposite just because of all the other boxing movies I have watched. You could never guess what would happen in the end of the movie. It seems like a regular boxing movie but the end takes a turn. This movie will keep you posted on your toes and always trying to guess what will happen next. This is a great movie for a family movie night. I would give this movie a 4 out of 5. I really recommend you watch ""A Million Dollar Baby"", you will learn an abundant of things through-out this movie, never give up on your goals and always push towards your dreams.",9

Maggie is a boxer. She wants to be world box champion. I think she has potential. Because she works a lot. And she will work a lot. A little bit thanks to Frank.

9 March 2005,what a waste of a movie,"Around half way through the movie I started to realize that this really had nothing in it. The fight scenes sucked lasting a total of 30 seconds each. Hillary Swank becomes a good winning fighter and we see none of the growth which is supposed to be joining her success, I know that the house she bought for her trashy mom was aimed at this but failed miserably. The whole euthenasia (sp) scene with Eastwood putting Swank 'down' like her late father did to a dog (circa old yeller) was contrite and completely unrealistic, ie when a patient is hooked up to those machines the whole system goes crazy if they are shut down and the fact that it is 'murder' under our judicial system, save Oregon. The writers want us to believe that all of a sudden Eastwood is going to be living in the boonies somewhere for the rest of his existence when in fact he will be easily found, (he has been visiting her everyday since she was admitted) arrested, put on trial and then thrown in jail. And what's up with the whole last half hour anyway not a mention of what happens to the other boxer, it was a boxing movie right, well what the hell happened to her? Sorry but Hollywood just took a whole slew of 'blockbuster' type scenarios put them all together and viola Oscar. ""Lets put a Freedman voice over, boxing, somebody running on the beach trying to 'prepare', Clint Eastwood being a tough ass, unaddressed societal issues all wrapped together with Hillary Swank's ugly ass face on it and see how much money we can rake in."" Well screw you Hollywood, I dissent from your Oscar winner.",

3 April 2005,Didn't move me at all,"Ms Swank shows us that her upbringing served her well. She didn't need to act, just bring back the little trailer girl that brought her to adulthood. She was wooden and boring, although almost believable as a woman who wanted to box (go figure!), and wouldn't listen to her ""coach"". I just never felt the least little bit about her. It was actually a relief to have the movie end as it did so I wouldn't hear her ""boss man"" thing even one more time. Clint Eastwood did not do himself proud on this one, although Morgan Freeman was excellent. I am shocked and amazed that this little movie got nominated for anything, let along won. Guess this is proof that one can just pay off the academy for awards. Wasted my evening. Good thing I didn't have any other plans that night.

6 November 2014,The Only Movie That Kept Me Thinking About It For Days,"When we think about a movie that deals with the story of a fighter, what we expect is a story of struggle, hard work, journey and finally success.This movie give all of it but all of these thing can't make the ""Motion Picture Of The Year"".What actually make this movie better than many other movies on the same subject was it's simplicity of the plot.It was clean, simple and heartfelt.Another important aspect of the movie was the very emotional and rather depressing second half.That emotional touch gave this movie the actual backbone which could never be achieve by blood and gruesome fighting and action.Altogether this is not a movie about the success but it is the story about putting everything you have at risk for a dream that no one but you can see.It is about the struggle behind getting a shot and the contentment you fell after having the shot (whether you win or not) at the goal that you have dreamed for most of your life.

14 July 2014,I am still crying 1 hr later and am often called emotionless.,"I am no movie critic expert, just a plain Joe Bloggs kind a guy living in NZ. I also have never written a review on this site before, even though I have frequently visited this site for looking up good movies to watch. BUT I HAD to say something about this movie as I am an emotional wreck after watching Million Dollar Baby.

If you want to watch a movie that grabs you from the start and keeps you transfixed to the screen, then rips your heart out and makes you cry like you have never cried before after a movie, then this is the movie for you. Not recommended for people who do not like sad emotionally moving movies or pro lifers.

Sure there are minor flaws to the movies as pointed out by the people who hated the movie, and yea when I read their points of view, I can see what they are talking about. Unfortunately that's what happens when you become informed about the arts. You get too picky and technical and miss the whole point or feel to the art.

As I said I am Joe Bloggs when it comes to movies but I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 as it really moved me and I will remember it for a longtime. It would go in my top 3 movies I have ever seen.",10
23 February 2016,Exelence,"A masterpiece that will spoil not only sport, in particular boxing fans, but movie enthusiasts as well. The softly told story about hard, crushing punches that life throws inside the ring and outside of it. Breathtaking performance from all the main characters, especially Hilary Swank. She shines in all her beauty and her undoubtful talent takes you by the hand as she slides between the ropes. The supporting characters are carefully chiseled and take the movie to another level. Clint Eastwood, already proved to be one of the best directors ever to take the roll, sets that bar yet a bit higher. And the music is so delicate and intelligent, that it fuses with the movie perfectly. It will make you cry. It will make you laugh. It will make you sad. And it will make you happy.

28 March 2005,"Thanks to this film, the Oscars have now officially become a sham","Ever since Titanic won the Best Picture Oscar (and to top that, 11 Oscars), the Oscars have gradually been digging their own grave. A year later we had to witness ""Shakespeare in Love"" take home the gold over ""Saving Private Ryan"". Then in 2002 we saw ""Chicago"" beat films such as Gangs of New York, The Pianist, Catch Me If You Can, and not to forget Road to Perdition for Best Picture. And now the Oscars have finally put the final nail in the coffin with awarding Million Dollar Baby their ""Best Picture of the Year"" of 2004.

I have seen all the ""Oscar"" nominee films, and I can clearly say that their were a number of films better in direction, cinematography, acting ability and writing. I place the following films better than MDB, such as THE AVIATOR, SIDEWAYS and what I regard as the Best Picture of 2004, ""ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND"". I firmly place Million Dollar Baby at 4th. And for Eternal Sunshine not even to be nominated for Picture, Direction (Gondry) and Actor (Jim Carrey) is an absolute disgrace, and the Academy knows it.

Let's face the fact. Scorsese was robbed of his Oscar by Eastwood. Eternal Sunshine was completely ignored, and the Academy instead focused it's attention on Million Dollar Baby. The reason? Eternal Sunshine had Jim Carey in it (which the Academy hates), and Million Dollar Baby was by Eastwood, and that's the only reason it won. Otherwise, ETERNAL SUNSHINE was (by far) the Best Picture of 2004.

As for the Academy, who knows what they'll come up with next? I suspect next year's ""Best"" Picture will be won by the producers of Gigli, directed by James Cameron, whilst the Acting awards will be won by Jennifer Lopez and Chris Rock respectively. Supporting awards will be given out to Lindsay Lohan and Ashton Kutcher, whilst Clint Eastwood will probably be named Best Director. For what? Who knows.",
19 June 2011,One of the Best movies I have ever watched!,"I was simply speechless after watching this masterpiece which is heartrending to the core and gives you immense hope in the innate goodness of human being. But the best part of this movie I believe is that it does not run around any cliché, it is not a boxing movie neither it is a underdog movie and it helps that all the actors in this Clint Eastwood,Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank are such stellar actors. It is a movie where we get to meet some people with strong character and commitment to what they do but fortunately they are not perfect and it is their imperfections which make them memorable. In short it makes you feel good to be human!If you haven't watched this movie, please go see it..You Deserve it!

15 April 2006,Academy Award intentions clear,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",5

17 February 2005,"Dirty Harry does an Agenda Movie? ? ? Excellent entertainment, though .....","Dirty Harry didn't need to do an ""Agenda Movie"" ..... He's better than that!

Thought he was above attempting to change societal morals!

Yet, I have to admit ""$Million Dollar Baby"" sure doesn't seem like a typical agenda movie .... yet .... one has to take it for face value.

On 2nd thought, maybe it's not ..... it's your call! Either way, it's worth seeing!

It's not that euthanasia is not an integral part of the movie; it is!

It's not that it wasn't well done! It was!

It's not that the act itself wasn't a compassionate act.

It was! ..... as far as when she asked for his help and only regarding the body and suffering!

Thing is, it ignores the reason for pain. Whether physical or emotional!

And like it or not, there IS, ... a reason for pain.

We all know that pain keeps us from leaving our hand on an extremely hot wood stove but what about emotion or psychological pain?

Is there no reason to learn a lesson here? Of course there is!

To play God and make a final decision impacting our afterlife in eternity? The garden of eden was about playing our roles and not trying to outguess or over-rule God!

I know ....; it all comes down to whether there is a God or not ..... Thing is, there is! If you don't know, you've not asked Him if He exists!

When I was 'out of my body', I learned that the body was only the tent I temporarily live in ...... and 'what was out' was what was actually me, not the body!

After one makes that final decision and asks someone to pull the plug, then, I would hope there'd be a compassionate decision-maker around .... and that doesn't mean one that would comply with the risk, but would first make sure that one knows and has made an appropriate choice. After that decision, ..... rather the correct one, one should possibly be able to opt out of permanent pain.

Yet, that'd probably be just before stem cell research became a reality ..... life just sometimes plays out that way .....

Maybe there is another reason to go through the pain ..... even emotional pain.

I submit that God designed life this way for a reason! I sure couldn't have seen that when the doctors were going to amputate both legs, ..... almost 31 years ago, and I'm glad I didn't opt for leaving the movie before it finished! Otherwise ..... I wouldn't have married, had a wonderful son, be able to go bass fishing, ride my motorcycle, etc. My legs were saved; things we cannot foresee can happen.

Don't leave this one early; so what if it cleans out the tear ducts?!

Yet, I have to admit, I'm still waiting for movies to take that next step and approach it objectively and confront the philosophical and religious questions!

What? You say Hell is freezing ....? I'll wait and see ......

Though, they say Dirty Harry now lives on the McKenzie and that the water there is a bit magical .....",
19 August 2021,Film at it's finest,"Remarkable. If I had to use only one word to describe this film that wouldn't do it justice. But remarkable it is. This is film at it's best. It touches all emotional tones with remarkable story telling and the type of story telling only able to be accomplished with the right ensemble. From Morgan Freeman voice in narration to Clint Eastwood's trademark touch but most of all with Hillary Swank's ability to steal the show and achieve a height very seldom attained. Very few films have this ability, to put it all together. To say it's a ""must watch"" is selling it short, but a must watch it is and then some.

22 April 2012,Million Dollar Baby,"Million Dollar Baby

The movie Million Dollar Baby stars Oscar award winning actors Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank, the storyline is Maggie, played by (Swank) was an amateur female boxer from a same town in Missouri, went to the big city to train to become a professional. Swank's performance really added to the theme of the movie, it was an emotional drama with a sports back draw, it could bring to mind the first (Rocky) with its emotional tie. Maggie sought out trainer Frankie played by (Eastwood), who is a great trainer but has little success training championship boxers, in the past. Maggie, a quiet loner was turned down by Frankie, but continued to come to the gym and train anyway. Eddie, played by (Freeman) was a partner of Frankie and pretty much the overseer in the gym, he befriended Maggie and watched her dedication and gave what he could to assist her in her endeavor to be a champion. Although turned down by Frankie, Maggie continued to come in everyday and train, Frankie gave in and became her trainer. He agreed to train her but told her he'd train her until he could find her a manager. Before Maggie's first fight Frankie left Maggie with another manager only to come back and see Maggie win the fight. As the movie goes on, the relationship between Maggie and Frankie becomes more of a father/daughter then a manager/boxer partnership. Maggie's skills were honed to the point that she began knocking opponents out in the first round, although she was becoming a great fighter, Frankie being the father figure protected her from fights against top ranked contenders. (Ebert, 2005) Maggie's grew frustrated and requested to fight the best; Frankie agreed to fight against the women's welterweight champion Billie ""The Blue Bear"" a German fighter that's known for fighting dirty. Maggie unshaken by the German's fight game, she gave the champion all she could handle to the point that she was beating the champ and forced the champ to throw a sucker punch from behind when Maggie wasn't looking. This caused Maggie to fall head first on a chair that was being placed in the ring that fighters sit on in between rounds. The fall caused Maggie to break her neck and become a quadriplegic. Maggie, refuse to accept the prognosis that she would never recover and regain mobility in her limbs, Frankie being that father figure steps up to help her through this trying time and help with anything she needed done. Including dealing with Maggie's family trying to use her and take all her money. Clint Eastwood did a great job using the slow motion and still photograph when Maggie was hit from behind in the ring and showing her head hitting the chair. That scene was very shocking and emotional; it intensified the moment and added to the emotional quality of the film. This added to the dramatic effect of the film and tied Maggie and Frankie together to build up to the climax of the movie, where Frankie assisted Maggie in taking her life because she didn't want to be a vegetable for the rest of her life.

This is without a doubt one of the best films of the year, a must see.",

1 August 2005,a joke of a film,"I paid ten bucks to see this stunningly mediocre movie on the big screen, and what a laugh. The dialog is corny as can be, the character's emotional reactions are staggeringly unrealistic, the casting is a farce, every character in this film cannot rise above a two-dimensional cookie-cutout. Cliché after cliché after cliché, with some glycerin tears and a scary-looking black psychopathic female boxer thrown in to thrill and impress the Midwestern mentality. bored to the brink of tears, i want my money back. i give it a two only because it's not the worst film i've ever seen, but it's not worthy of any awards. And what is the deal with being forced to write more than i care to? this film doesn't deserve ten lines of comment and i want it to be known that i went out of my way to write the last two sentences only because this Nazi site won't let me post otherwise.

14 January 2005,Scenes long enough for deeper reflection,"The comment below is borrowed from another's, for which I wish to comment upon in brief. I find the 'others' comment regarding finding a fault with ""Mr. Eastwoods'tendency to allow scenes to go on too long"" contrary to my experience; In those ""too long"" scenes I am given the time to let my imagination take part in the scene (with those mental images intended or just those of my own making. The time gives me more reflective input and I come away with the feeling the film had something to do with me.

Maybe I'm just slow at 63.

Mr Eastwood and Mr Freeman are my favorite actors; They both give something real and heartfelt to their characters, and something noble and strong. As to others'comments: ""ad-libbed"" In my view, much of real life is ad-libbed (we are as humans, very reactive, and are not reading from a script, and are living from moment to moment. I wish I could remember the movie more clearly so as to be able to comment on the others': ""minor logical inconsistencies."" My final comment,is somewhat negative;However, I feel the language was offensive;Again,however, in their world (Million Dollar Baby's)that is the way it is I suppose. I apologize to those in that real world, for I'm sure there are those whom are more disciplined. Below are not my comments. PILGIM.

""However, the film is not without fault...Eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air. The dialog at times appears a little too ad-libbed. There are some minor logical inconsistencies. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.""",
6 March 2005,One of stupidest movies of 2004,"One of the stupidest movies of the year!!!Boring,dull,predictive,pathetic,bad acting...Why Morgan Freeman wins for best supporting role?Maybe for the roles in earlier movies? He has only talking hole movie.Clive Owen was much much better in Closer. This is shame for Academy. Aviator is much much better and complex movie.Di Caprio is great. To compare Scorsese and Eastwood is like to compare Rollce Royce and Mazda... I am from Serbia and I am very surprised,not to say shocking with some critics for this movie. The 2 stupidest movies that I have seen in recent times are Million Dollar Baby and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. I think that Academy hates Scorsese.I don't have any other explanation.

26 January 2005,about the movie,"hey i just went to go see Million Dollar Baby and it is a AMAZING video! at first when she goes to the champion ships you think to your self "" since the name of the video is Million Dollar Baby she will probably win but in the end she doesn't. this movie was the best i cant wait till it comes out! i got to admit tho i cried when she died and I'm sure a lot of people in the movie theater did to i know my mom did she told me so...but like i said i can not wait till it comes out i am going to by it right away! if i didn't get the special ticket to go see the movie i would have gone and seen it any way because it is worth $8.75 usually i don't go to Silvercity and pay to go watch a movie i will usually go to the cheap movies but this movie is really good i advise a lot of people to go check it out!

30 January 2005,"Had me 'til the ending, then I crashed","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",

3 February 2005,What was the Gaelic phrase?,"I thought that this was another truly remarkable film from Clint Eastwood and loved the moment when he finally revealed to Hilary Swank's character the meaning of her Boxing name but like the idiot that i am I have forgotten it and was hoping that someone could help me out? Think it meant darling/one I love or something along those lines (please let me know if it was) but can't remember how to spell it in Gaelic!Also wondering what others thought of Clint Eastwood's other films- I love Mystic River (again a fantastic cast and a beautifully told story) but was not overly keen on Unforgiven. Anyone know if Clint is planning to direct any other films or is he about ready to retire? Cheers

4 February 2005,Hillary Swank owns this character.,"If you are seeking a film with emotional depth...this is it. The acting is flawless, the characters vivid, and the pacing is as artful as the footwork of a champion prizefighter. This is not a hardcore boxing movie. It is an exploration of the philosophical. The background is superbly designed; a masterfully crafted framework for the art contained within.

The universal humanity of this film transcends any epic from recent years. I predict at least four and perhaps five Oscars for ""Million Dollar Baby"".

Swank owns Maggie Fitzgerald like De Niro owns Travis Bickle.

5 February 2005,I liked it.,"The first part of the movie seems like a corny rehash of cliché stuff about boxing. The Clint Eastwood character is a burned-out relic of a manager, and the Hilary Swank character is a 31-year-old boxing buff who has one last chance to make it. So she wins him over blah blah blah.

If that were all there was to the movie, it would be a small-screen time-waster, and you had to wonder what all the buzz was about -- there _is_ buzz, Academy Awards for lots of categories -- because it was basically Eastwood being dark and contained and Swank being goshwow and bubbly. But then over it all was Morgan Freeman, as a Watson-type viewpoint character, doing a voice-over with that incredible rasping voice. He can say more with a moment of silence than some actors can do with a page of Shakespeare.

There's also (to me) the cognitive dissonance of watching pretty girls beat the crap out of eat other for money. I didn't even know women did prize-fighting.

I don't want to reveal the movie's ""surprise"" ending, though it's not so much a surprise as a paradigm shift. A fair comparison would be last year's _Seabiscuit_: a sports movie that seems to follow the classic mold, and then turns modern-to-postmodern on you. I found it pretty satisfying, and through the movie's final twists and turns, you feel the tight control Eastwood had, as director-producer and extremely restrained actor. (He also wrote the score, which is good.)

Maybe it's not a feel-good movie. Maybe it depends on what makes you feel good.",

What about her father?

It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress.

It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

31 March 2005,Goodness,"I know I'm going to get criticized and ridiculed by some supremely opinionated people that can't stand the fact that someone is disagreeing with them, but I couldn't stand this movie. The acting was great, parts of it were good, I was completely surprised by what happened in the movie, but in the end, I thought it sucked. I'm sorry, but I, unlike most of America do not go to a movie only to leave it crying and feeling suicidal. I have no moral objections to the movie, and what happened, it was just way too depressing. It doesn't matter to me if other people liked this movie, they can have their own opinion, but I don't like any movie that makes me cry for half the movie and half the night after it.

Which brings me to my second annoyance. The Oscars...now, there was some great acting in this movie, and the people that were in it should've won for best acting, but what is the Oscar obsession with nominating the most depressing movies imaginable for the Oscars? Why not nominate a comedy, it's much harder to make someone laugh than it is to make them cry.

4 March 2014,Million Dollar Movie,"This movie is magnificent. The actors seemed so comfortable in their roles you'd forget that they are, in fact, acting. Clint Eastwood fills his niche to the brim and does it like no one else. Freeman is Freeman and Freeman is amazing. Hillary Swank surprised me, honestly I didn't expect much out of her, but she really delivers. You feel for these characters, every punch every blow. The film doesn't run like Rocky, you don't know how it's going to end you watch it in the eyes of Eastwood. Does tend to drag a bit in the end but that is quickly overshadowed by the incredible sympathetic performances of Swank and Eastwood. the ending will leave you feeling older, not wiser, just older. Go see this film if you haven't already, it's worth your time.

1 May 2005,Pathetic split heroes vs. villains,"Leaving aside the already commented unrealisticness (Swank winning almost ALL fights in the fist round by KO, eating restaurant leftovers all the time, last fight lost after a automatic-disqualification-action by the opponent...), what really made me sick was the clear-cut split of the characters between heroes and villains:

HEROES: Swank (tough fighter but loving trainee, made a drama of a broken nose) Eastwood (Togh guy with a golden heart) Freeman (typical trainer with a cut-shorted career that spend all the movie giving speeches)

WICKED VILLAINS:

Maggie's Mother (My favorite one, not a single good feeling is known from her. Pure evil)

Blue Bear (The only thing we know from her is how dirty she is at boxing. She is therefore expected to have won all her fights with Alwin's and other tricks. Her look talks by itself)

Bad guy of the gym (His only aim in life is to hit to death a weak, skinny and crazy child because he talks too much. Notwithstanding his muscles, he gets knocked out by a single-eyed ex-boxer 50 years older than him.

Let's see if in next Eastwood's movie characters are more subtle than those of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""",

4 May 2014,If you are looking for a good mix of action and drama this is a great film.,"This film introduces a struggling thirty-one year old waitress named Maggie, played by Hillary Swank, who has a desire to make it big in the women's boxing arena. Her biggest obstacle is to convince Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, to accept the position to train her to be a prize winning fighter. Frankie doesn't seem interested in this endeavor due to his past mistakes while training Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris played by Morgan Freeman. Eddie ""Scrap"" just happens to be Frankie's only real friend, who lives and works in the ""Hit Pit"", Frankie's rundown old gym in Los Angeles, California. Scrap noticed Maggie's potential and works on getting Frankie to forgive himself and give Maggie a chance.

I was drawn to watch this film because of the appearance that is was an action boxing film but it turned out that it was more dramatic verses action packed. I'm not into watching dramas, however, this film had a good balance of action scenes to keep my interest. The dramatic elements of the film were also interesting and added to the overall theme of getting Frankie to give himself another chance at training as well as letting Maggie have the opportunity to show the world what she is made of.

The storyline continues as Frankie trains Maggie and they develop a strong father-daughter bond. During this time Frankie begins to feel he has made the right choice in training Maggie because she turns out to perform very well. Frankie finds redemption from his inner demons and fears by watching Maggie doing what she loves, this reminds him of a relationship with his own daughter that he neglected to cultivate. Unfortunately as fate would have it, the story takes a dramatic turn for the worst and Frankie is again faced with making a moral decision at Maggie's request. This film's theme is similar to that of ""The Karate Kid"" where and older and wiser father figure takes a young naive apprentice under his wing. In this film, Frankie takes Maggie under his training ""wing"" to develop her natural skills into ones that will allow her to beat the odds and live her dream of being a prize fighter.

The use of the close up accessory lens in the gym office scene with Frankie and Scrap was a good example of how the cinematographer is able to focus in on the foreground on one side and background on the opposite side. This allowed the viewer to see Maggie's determination toward her training in the background while viewing the conversation between Frankie and Scrap in the foreground.

This film shows that in spite of your past failures life can give you opportunities to overcome inner struggles. It also proves that with hard work and determination anything is possible.",7
27 July 2005,"As a real medical doctor, Clint Eastwood needed a medical consultant","I have seen this movie over and over again for at least 10-12 times.

I never expect the ending is so tragic.

But as a doctor, there are some more research Clint Eastwood has to do (I had the DVD).

No. 1 Clint Eastwood can not disconnect any respirator in the middle of the night without the alarm goes off (He did not consult the doctor for assisted-suicide procedure !) No. 2. By injecting adrenaline, the patient (Maggie) will go into convulsion (seizure) and the EKG will show polyventricular arrhythmia instead of a flat line and then still takes 4 and 1/2 minutes to die if a very large dose is used.

No. 3. The ulcer in the leg is overblown, any rehab will not allow such ulcer top occur.

Those are minor medical mistakes.

But the ending is poorly done and most boxers died of intra-cerebrum bleeding (bleeding in the brain) instead of complete C1 and C2 fracture.

But I hate the ending, make me cry and cry and cry ! I always shut down the DVBD player before the end of the boxing match with the bitch ! There is no boxing referee allowed such boxer to hit Maggie !!",10
16 January 2006,Million Dollar Baby should not have won best picture award,"******SPOILERS************

I just saw Million Dollar Baby for the first time. What I don't understand is why they had Frankie had to turn off the respirator. He said, ""I will turn off your air machine and you will go to sleep. I'll give you an injection and you will STAY asleep."" If this had been a real life situation, turning off the respirator would have sounded an alarm in the nurse's station and brought the nurses running in to re-connect it before Frankie could have administered the adrenalin to Maggie- and he would have been hauled off by the police. It was not necessary to turn off the respirator. Turning it off would only make her start gasping for breath in time, alert the nurses and make her death more painful. The adrenalin would have killed her by itself in a few minutes and he would have had time to escape. Surely they have medical advisers. How could they make such a mistake?

I don't know much about boxing, but in real life, during a world championship bout, considering the obvious and deliberately illegal tactics used by Blue Bear during the first round, it have resulted in her disqualification. Also, Blue Bear's punch after the bell was so late and so violent it would have resulted in an immediate disqualification. Would the referee turn his back on the two fighters unless they were both in their respective corners? However, even if he didn't see the late (and ultimately fatal) punch, the officials and judges would have notified the referee. How could they declare Maggie the loser and BB the winner?

What was with the priest? I'm not Catholic, but I don't think priests would drop the ""F bomb""- and be so rude and negative with Frankie. This was the only one in the movie and completely unrealistic and unnecessary.

I enjoyed the movie. I think the performances by Swank, Eastwood and Freeman were great, and I don't begrudge them (Swank and Freeman) their Oscars -especially in light of the other performances that year, but due to the major flaws related above, it should NOT have won best picture.",6
29 October 2014,Review Cultura,"Million Dollar Baby - A New History of boxing By Clint Eastwood

I've always been interested in the history of struggle, so when I had the chance to watch this movie. I watched this movie because I love boxing and am inspired to practice the actress.

The film is about the dreams of a girl practicing boxing and suffer much prejudice. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a boxing gym, his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) a former boxer who lost an eye during a boxing match who now lives in a room contently in academy gymnasium. And then it kicks in, at your gym, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), who always had some life, but unlike many, knows what he wants and has the determination to attain it. She goes to the gym every day to practice on their own, even though she does not know how to do it right at all. Your willpower somehow impresses Scrap. Eventually, Frankie decides to train her, out of his incredible will power. Maggie trains intensely, because this is your dream, your only pursuit, she wants to get there, and in the end she did not get there ...

Another thing I particularly like about the movie is the true passion of boxing plays by Hilary Swank, the passion of the trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who treats her like a daughter and in doing so, he in makes you think, there are many points Which leave you wonder: what price dreams?

I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys boxing, and not for those who have so much passion for boxing, because it is also a beautiful story, you may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it.",10
5 June 2005,"I think the story has the ""appropriate"" end","I think the story has the ""appropriate"" end. If would have been an happy-end I should have felt like cheated (happy endings are not so common as in movies) and we would have had another ""american dream"" story told by Eastwood himself (hopefully it wasn't). I do also see that the central issue of this story is about winning (or getting esteem or respect, fame, call it like you want) and is about the hated side of winning, meaning losing. Everybody expects you to win but can you afford to lose, especially when you are supposed to cry if you get hurt? And she turned out to be the toughest. The rest of the story is merely a pretext: boxing seems to be a pretty impressive (and accessible through fighter's ""guts"" mixed with inspired training) way to honestly get ""people chanting"" your name (a sort of fame); Dunn's daughter is the receiver for Scrap's all film's length read letter, she could possibly even not exist anymore, Dunn said she was ""his family"", someone whom he could care if left. Although there are a few other characters (Freeman has a fine performance), the story follows the two main characters in three places: gym, boxing ring and hospital (which makes it brilliantly simple). There was much ado about the father-daughter relation (something like need/offer of dearness, protection etc.). I don't think this prevailed a more fine relation as it is between honest fighters sympathy, loyalty and generosity. She had the kind of innocent dream plus passion that tempted him to be loyal to (once again); so he decided to play the role of the experienced guide and there were little risks because there were no so high stakes. She wanted so much to play for the highest stake and he couldn't refuse to (could be by vanity: it is the first time that is training a challenger; could be by pride: he cannot step back; could be by loyalty: he wanted to give back his best for her belief, she couldn't be wrong coming at him, could she ?). But all the decisions seem made by her and all the other are assisting doing their best sympathetically. Everybody knows the unwanted sides of competitions of that kind (the scene where she find that one of her's blitz won had a broken timpani). It's all decided there in the ring, you do not know the number of the fight that sends you out. She faces that with a great courage and consciousness (I think Swank's best performance was for this side of her acting). Actually she is continuing her fight in the hospital bed, and this time the stakes are too real: with her greedy family, with the coach and with the rules that kept her alive. It is impressive that she doesn't complain or ask compassion. A real classic hero. If there is an impression that the movie ""is melodramatic"", that could certainly not be imputed to Swank. Overall I consider Eastwood's and Freeman's characters well pounded. Their characters, although could have been more rough, more cynical, are in fact rather sensitive and kind, I hope not one of the last signs of human tenderness on screens. Clint Eastwood is a great director for this movie. The image and the setting are good and right.

This might be looked as well as another modern version of Icarus myth.",8

7 December 2015,Perfect,"One of the best motivational, realistic and touching movie ever!

Hillary Swank is an amazing actress, just as Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman! This movie is about not giving up, fighting, obeying, struggling, faith, belief, hard-work, pain, blood, glory, death . It combines all of these and creates a mind blowing masterpiece. I've seen this movie for hundred of times and it still leaves me crying.

I think this film is a must watch for everybody! It's just impossible not to fall in love with the performance of the actors and the disturbing story of the main character. The end is just perfect, in the saddest possible way..

It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.

I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.

1 August 2005,Those questionable fight scenes,"Overall, I really liked M$B. The movie lives up to its acclaim, but being a sports fanatic, I was disappointed by the Rocky-esquire fight scenes. I normally can get past the small stuff, but every fight being three hits and a KO took away from the true struggle it takes to be a championship fighter. I think she gets hit maybe ten times in the entire movie. I understand this isn't so much about fighting, but more effort could have been put into her character. I think a lot of people were lulled into loving this movie because of the smooth narriation of Morgan Freeman. It almost got me too..but it was a little to Shawshank Redemption.

4 August 2005,are you a boxing fan??,"Great acting, great cast, great storyline. I liked this movie but was a bit disappointed... I expected a different ending and it seemed to slow down a bit in the middle..But This does not distract from the movie at all and it is well worth watching. Clint Éastwood gives a fine, moving performance, much different from his western movies and Hillary Swank's portrayal of a women in a mans world came off very real and believable.I really like Morgan Freeman, he always seems to play down to earth, unpretentious characters and he gives a great performance in this movie. If I was a boxing fan my rating probably would have been 8 out of 10, but it is at least a 7 out of 10 in my opinion.

17 August 2005,It's so sad.....,"While I liked the movie a little, it just seemed very downbeat and sad the entire time. It's so depressing, you just don't like it as much. The entire atmosphere is depressing. The lighting is dark and shadowed. The whole movie seems gray, and just sad. The acting is good, the plot is good, everything else is good, but I just got tired of seeing depressed scenes the entire time.

The whole point of the movie seemed to be to make you feel sorry for all the characters. They all have problems that make you think ""aw, thats so sad for them"" Even a few minor character(not to name any), have problems you feel sorry for. Maybe if not every character had a problem, and the whole movie wasn't so depressing, it would be a lot better.

19 April 2020,prefect ending,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.

Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.

Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.

Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.

Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.

I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.

To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.

It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.

Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004.

21 October 2005,"Great character study, but...","This movie is possibly Clint Eastwood's finest character study. As a character study, it focuses on three main characters, all of which are brilliantly drawn. I won't add ink on this subject, since it's already been dealt with by numerous others. Even minor characters, with one exception, are generally drawn with deftness. Only one minor character, a Catholic priest, ends up being a punching bag for the director, and thereby hints at the main flaw of the movie as art.

The movie tries to be something it ultimately isn't. It tries to be a morality play. It succeeds in this fairly well up until the last, controversial, scene, albeit at a level that was already well covered in the Rocky films. That is, it portrays the kind of spirit required to succeed in boxing and generally lets the viewer draw inferences about how that applies in life in general. It quotes an aphorism of the author of the original story, F.X. Toole, that has a significance for viewers that goes beyond where the movie reaches. The greatest tragedy of the film is that the director didn't see its widest application. If he had, this movie would not have become a poster child for a particular movement (but I don't want to divulge the ending, so I will continue to speak in oblique terms, get me?).

Here's the rub. The quote is this: ""Instead of running from pain, which is the natural thing in life, in boxing you step into it, get me?"" The pain portrayed at the end of the movie is precisely the pain that people in this movement run away from. It is precisely the pain that two of the characters in the movie ultimately run away from. The secret of growing in the spiritual life is to step into it.",5
23 October 2005,I have one word for this movie - SLOW!,"Clint Eastwood is one of my all time favorites and he was great in this too, except at the end of the movie. The plot is also plausible, except for the last 1/2 hour or so. There were some really funny spots, and some really sad ones. I enjoyed the dynamics among the characters, especially when the extended family is introduced. Clint is his usual rough/soft character in this and in the end the soft wins out. Morgan Freeman is absolutely awesome in this, as he is in everything I've ever seen him in. He and Clint are like 2 old shoes together and really play off each other. However, I have one word to sum it all up - SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!!!

29 November 2005,Million Dollar Baby,"Well performed and well directed. It isn't better than Mystic River, but is a great movie. Clint Eastwood isn't good acting as directing. Morgan Freeman did great in this movie, and finally got an Oscar. Hillary Swank was excellent. I saw Mystic River a few weeks later of seeing Million Dollar Baby on DVD, and i thought, if The Return of the King haven't been nominated for the Oscar with Mystic River, Mystic River would have won. But Clint Eastwood made another excellent movie the next year, and there weren't any more books of The Lord of the Rings to be taken to the screen to compete with. It's fair that this movie is in the Top 250, and i hope it continue to be there for a long time.

27 December 2005,courage,"the courage to tell an honest story. the courage to act that story, direct that story.

this story about what it takes, what it can cost, to do what you know you must do. to follow your heart and leave behind your past.

hillary swank, clint eastwood, and morgan freeman have lived enough, well enough, to do maggie justice. they all saw that once she had made it, had begun to live her life as a fighter, that anything less was not worth it to her.

she made her life, and she gave it up.

just as frankie dunn made his life, his regrets, and gave it up in the white hot fire of maggie. gave up his regret for his daughter, and forged new hope with maggie. gave up his fear of reaching past his limits.

but his fear comes true again, after scrape's injury, now maggie is so much worse. and frankie feel's it is his fault, his fault again.

and then he comes know what he owes maggie.",
28 December 2005,Every move is telegraphed.,"Sweet film, but completely obvious and overwrought at every turn. From the deliberate plot points to the music designed to cue your emotions, it's a film that doesn't ask much from its audience and delivers just as much in return.

It's not that it's a bad film, but it's such a lightweight melodrama. I suppose I expected more from an Oscar winner but who are we kidding; we are a long way away from the days of a film like Midnight Cowboy winning.

Speaking of the Oscars:

Direction: Eastwood's directing masterpiece is Unforgiven, hands down. MDB doesn't come close to delivering what Unforgiven has for the audience, and with a genre film - great.

Best Supporting Actor: What can you say about Freeman, he's always solid but how is this performance different than, say, The Shawshank Redemption? Furthermore, he's also much better in Unforgiven.

Best Supporting Actress: I've never been a fan of Swank's work. She looks and acts like Matt Damon, another actor I don't like. It's not that their bad actors, but it's so apparent in their mannerism that they believe their own hype. Because of that, they end up giving measured performances. They both have no emotional cores. Although, I will say that this was the best of Swank's performances so far; still not Oscar worthy though.",10
1 January 2006,nurturing and protection v's absence of,"I don't know if this is what million dollar baby's message was but its just an attempt from me to try and interpret it to the limit of my understanding,and maybe I've got it totally wrong,maybe i was'nt suppose to think all night about this movie and try and find the answer to it what was the moral message it had? Anyway could the film deep down be about the conseqences of choosing to seek glory in a way that compromises your nuturing nature.Hillary Swanks character didn't have a nurturing relationship with her mother and her father wasn't around for long.She wanted to fight,she had been fighting all her life for people to respect her she felt she had always been seen as a nothing.she wanted to prove herself, yes she could make it,i guess she wanted to make clint eastwoods character proud,he was the father figure.Her mother didn't care about her so all she wanted to do was make her father proud,Hillary swanks character wanted this so you cant blame clints character for what happened to her he wanted to protect her,but you cant blame hillary's character as she was seeking the love that would complete her, her mothers which wasn't evident and the fathers by making him proud but if a father cant protect and a mother cant nurture if its not there what happens ?if protection and nuture are not with someone if in a sense it is given up,it makes room for everything that is opposite a total disrespect for human life as seen in the former prostitute title holder who had no problems about fighting with fatal blows to just get rid of her opponent.I really cant think about this anymore there are some big questions in this film i know its going to stay with me many more days yet ,i have to watch it again to get clearer on the film.I guess this comment wont help anyone as i wrote it for you to help me with the film.",
1 May 2019,Heartbreaking,"I have to be honest, I didn't expect the plot twist of this film. Yet, I can highly assure that this movie doesn't dissapoint. I first came to this movie thinking I was going to see a female version of Rocky Balboa, with lots of sound effects and thousands of punches from contender to contender. Nevertheless, I was highly shocked with the realism of this movie. The message is clear: go find your dream before life hits you .

9 March 2015,Another great heart touching Eastwood movie!,"I have fallen in love with Clint Eastwood as a director!

This movie along with other like Gran Torino, know how to quietly hold your attention, get your heart involved, then make an emotional ,heros' ending that leaves you emotionally drained while crying for more!

I always liked him as an actor. Nobody does the hard nose, old time cop, hero, etc.. As he does. As a director, he just knows how to craft his movies into that emotional level that gets your adrenalin pumping to your heart, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This being done at the same time as him making you fall in love with the hero and brings tearful ,emotional challenges that not only makes you cry from the hard choices the hero has to make but from the heroic selfless decision he will always make to save the other from whatever peril they are in.

well done!",10

22 October 2018,A Million Dollar Experience,"Million Dollar Baby tells a story that hits the viewer hard upon first viewing, and while that initial feeling hurts, it's one that I believe everybody should experience because this is a story that's so refreshing to see unfold before your eyes. The writing is superb and masterfully tells the story of these characters, especially Maggie, because you feel like you're legitimately living with her and watching her go along this journey filled with defeat and disappointments before she finally starts achieving everything she's ever wanted. The score also works perfectly in tandem with the writing, and the acting is fantastic from everyone involved with the film, such as actors with smaller roles like Mike Colter, to the star, Hilary Swank. Everybody does a perfect job with their respective roles and really help to build out this world of the underground boxing scene and where these characters come from.

However, this movie does have pacing issues, particularly towards the 3rd act of the film. The reason why pacing issues begin to develop towards the end is because the film is really attempting to draw out and elongate these interactions between two certain characters, which ultimately I feel like did more to hurt the emotional impact of the ending rather than help it.

With that being said, this film is absolutely worth watching for anybody who enjoys a story about triumph, perseverance, boxing, or simply just quality storytelling. Just be wary of the last 25 minutes that end up feeling like 50, but the finale of this movie will leave you in a state of disbelief. I strongly recommend this film.",7

22 October 2018,An Amazing Experience from Start to Finish!,"This was an excellent movie! At times both uplifting and grounding, it had a strong ethic of character-driven plot and character development throughout that it a strong emotional impact. The centerpiece of this film really was the performances of the actors, which made the characters come to life. I think the motivations, the hopes, dreams, and desires of each individual character was a key component in making us, the audience, care about what happened to them. This is a strong point for the writing, too, which was excellent throughout the whole film. The direction the film went in was bold, and I think it was executed well. It's really interesting that Eastwood (director, role of Frankie), also wrote the score, which was well-composed.

22 October 2018,Able to Hold its Own Among Heavyweights of the Genre,"Among the greatest movies of all time, boxing films, second maybe only to gangster films, are held in the highest regard. Raging Bull, Rocky, Heart and Soul, all have a place in the conversation for the best of cinema, and I think that Million Dollar Baby holds its own among the best of the genre. Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman each deliver perfect performances rife with heart and gravity. The editing perfectly complements emotional moments and amplifies the electric fight scenes. The cinematography is gorgeous throughout. And the narrative will give you hope and show you the value of it all in one stroke. It's a phenomenal film, one that's able to stand its own among the heavyweights of the genre.

4.5/5 Stars.

27 February 2006,"Million Dollar Baby: ""I Don't Train Girls""","Maggie Fitzgerald is a thirty-one year old amateur female boxer, and all she wants is a fighting chance. ""I don't train girls,"" says Frankie Dunn, a grizzled, but respected trainer who wants nothing to do with a girl fighter. With the help of Frankie's old partner and gym caretaker, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, they convince Frankie to coach and to be Maggie's manager. Frankie has a relationship problem with his long-lost daughter and adopts Maggie along with her career, until she is seriously injured in a fight for championship and Frankie has to make a decision.

This movie was made in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) is narrator through out this entire film. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is trying to escape her trailer-trash life and dysfunctional loser family. She accomplishes this by boxing, which she feels is her ""way out."" Frankie (Clint Eastwood) does not want to coach girls, but is finally convinced to not only coach Maggie, but also to become her manager. Maggie works very hard. She follows all Frankie's instructions, and does not ask any questions. When she finally starts fighting, she knocks out opponents in the first round. Soon nobody wants to fight her, so Frankie moves her up in class. She gets a fight against the champion, but everything goes wrong.

This movie does not have one particular plot, but several subplots. Frankie has a long-lost relationship with his daughter. He is constantly writing her letters, but they are all sent back to him. Maggie has a dysfunctional family which she is trying to escape. She also has a dream of becoming a professional fighter. This movie shows me that great films do not need one storyline, just great actors and directing.

This movie had excellent use of light and shade. There could not be any better characters put in one movie. I thought the part when Frankie asked Scrap why he had on socks with holes in them, his response was ""I like to get air to my feet at night,"" yet Frankie gave him money to buy socks, though the money made its way to the tracks. This movie will make a viewer laugh, cry, and be moved by this powerful boxing classic.",7
