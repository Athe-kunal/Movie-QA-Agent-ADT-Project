7 February 2022,Juror #4 is why this is a great film,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
12 August 2002,"The over-used term ""classic movie"" really comes into its own here!","This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90's TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating's sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?

There could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer's attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY'S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant's guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very ""ordinariness"" is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they're all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!

12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how ""truth"" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?

This is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide. IF you haven't seen it - you really should do something about that!",
26 April 2001,No Dissonance,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

8 June 2002,What a Character-Study Is Meant to Be.,"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.

31 January 2020,Dont judge by the age!,"For a while I was not very receptive to watching films that were too old. I always thought it would be difficult to get involved in the context, I couldn't be more wrong! 12 angry men, is a great example of how a simple film can do magic with good actors, and what great actors they are!

29 December 2006,Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.

12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.

12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!

10 June 2010,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!","There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox

23 October 2004,Simple but great.,"'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.

The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?

The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.

Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.

Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.

Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' mini-series. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.

Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!

11 January 2005,Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....,"........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!

When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.

So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.

This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......

18 September 2002,"No bombs, no car chases but edge of the seat stuff none the less","This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

22 September 2005,"If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.","I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old ""classics"". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",10

21 October 2019,Classic in every sense and moment and frame,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.

But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.

Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.

There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",10
14 February 2010,"Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?","The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

6 August 2005,I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.

27 April 2008,The material is slightly forced for dramatic purposes but the delivery is perfect across the board,"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.

I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.

The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.

Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.

With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",
8 April 2022,Gripping and Irresistable,"1957! 65 years ago and look at it, just look at it. This is Sidney Lumet's first feature film, up to this moment he had built his reputation on television. This was also the only film that Henry Fonda ever produced. He must have trusted Sidney Lumet very much and God was he right. Lumet concocts a masterful, choreographic coup. Within the four wall of the jury room the sense of claustrophobia, propels the drama forward in such a way that it's enough to catch a few minutes of the film to be totally hooked. Henry Fonda is superb and the rest of the cast a who's who of New York stage actors. From Jack Warden to Jack Klugman, from Lee J Cobb to E G Marshall. In my book, flawless.

24 April 2019,Masterpiece!,"The only thing I can write as an average Joe who watches movies simply to be entertained or see a story being told, is that I watched 12 Men argue in a room for more than an hour and I couldn't look away from the screen. Simply a masterpiece!

31 January 2020,The only version to see.,"In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Brilliant performances all around. A whole lot of dialogue, but you never get tired of listening. Lumet's first film-what an amazing talent. Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb stand out, but all are excellent. There was a prior TV version, which is horrible. Lumet's version is the only one to see.

1 September 2003,"Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world","This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.

30 July 2011,"""You can't send someone off to die with evidence like that"".","The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9

17 March 2019,12 men in a room. Genius.,"In my opinion, 12 Angry Men is the greatest film that has ever been created. A perfect example of less is more, the simplicity of the plot, the setting of the one room, and the acting talent of the 12 main cast members is enough to conquer the dramatic genre, and ensure that it remains a timeless classic.

Whether you are a fan of the older generation of filmmaking or not, I implore you to experience this acting masterclass for yourself. More current movies such as Resevoir Dogs, which is superb in itself, have borrowed elements from 12 Angry Men, but trust me when I say there is nothing quite like this beautifully crafted drama. Watch it.

1 July 2022,A Classic,"This movie is a very good example of what a good director can do with so little. Just the fact that everything happens in the same room is impressive. The details of the crime is only discussed, but it seems even more intterresting than if we would of actually seen it on screen. The characters are all played very well, the dialog is pretty good and the camera work is also really impressive for its time! Everything combined, this movie is simple but very good.

25 February 2022,The CASE for 12 ANGRY MEN,"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!

I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?

Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!

As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!

If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!",10
15 June 2023,An outstanding movie.,"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.

This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.

I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,

It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.

If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.

It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.

I won't highlight a single performance, each is as remarkable as the next.

4 January 2014,A top-notch cast under superb direction by Sidney Lumet makes this movie excellent in every aspect,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father .

Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins & 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"".

This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role . Furthermore , a Russian version (2007) by Nikita Mikhalkov with Sergey Garmash , Valentin Gaft , Aleksey Petrenko , Yuriy Stoyanov , Efremov , among others .",8
17 March 2003,A Classic not to be Missed,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.

The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.

This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.",8
19 February 2017,A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system,"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.

Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.

Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.

And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",9
2 June 2022,The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good.,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?

This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).

The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.

This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8
6 May 2022,"One of the best, most essential movies you could ever watch","At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.

This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.

The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.

Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.

It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity.",10
29 March 2020,"Simple, yet brilliant","This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed. The dialogue is phenomenal, the camerawork is absolutely phenomenal, the heat and claustrophobia of the environment sets in right away and gradually gets more and more intense. This film is absolutely phenomenal, and I would recommend it to absolutely anybody who enjoys film as an art form.

14 March 2011,"Is ""12 Angry Men"" a GREAT or NON GREAT movie? Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict ...","Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""

Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE""",10
9 January 2003,An Anti-Cinema Classic . Know What I Mean ?,"What a bloody stupid idea for a cinema film ! Adapt a teleplay set entirely in one studio bound location , written in real time with absolutely no cinema appeal whatsoever ! Me ? I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high drama

Despite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed "" Know what I mean "" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO . This is a classic film and one of the few ones I`ve awarded 10 points to

One last point: If you have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN how on earth can you describe yourself as a film fan ?",10
1 May 2019,I love this movie,"It makes us think, and question, about judging people before having the evidence of prosecution, even old the film is quite captivating and manages to entertain quite, unfortunately did not win Oscar but without doubt a great film.

28 September 2006,"So Simple, So Brilliant","So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.

One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.

Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.

As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.

12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.",9

6 March 2006,a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema,"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.

Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",10

5 July 2005,The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie,"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.

This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.

An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.

8 March 2022,"""Everyone has a breaking point""","12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.

Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film.

13 November 2005,"A bit overwrought, over-directed, but compelling nonetheless...","Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****

3 February 2008,Just watch the first 30 minutes of it and you'll put it far away on the very top of your list!!!,"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.

The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.

And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.

This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.

27 September 2004,Unsurpassed Character Study & Very Good Drama,"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.

One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.

In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.",

23 May 2007,The Lonely Juror,"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****",10

14 October 2006,Excellent !,"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++

""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.

When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.

""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.

One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",8
16 April 2021,My highest honored film,"I have only seen this movie once, but it forever lives in my mind. I would very much like to own it on DVD soon.

The movie is over 60 years old but it still holds up today because of the tight-knit set and simple story. Some of the performances are still unsurpassed in regards to most of the classic cinema I have seen.

It is highly awarded/honored amongst the film society, and I recommend it to everyone because it is a classic and it has some of the most profound scenes you'll see from a movie even with little to no extreme action, gimmicks, etc.

Just great acting, a simple but profound story, excellent directing, good suspense, and more...

20 October 2004,Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes,"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.

In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.

Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.

Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",7

30 September 2014,Deservedly a Top Ten Film,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.

Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).

This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money.

22 November 2009,The Power of Persuasion,"An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 ""Studio One"" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing ""Best Actor"" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.

No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model.

The defense rests.

19 November 2013,12 Angry Men doesn't made me angry. It makes me think. It's one good movie.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
9 April 2022,A masterful chmaber drama that creates palpable tension from its magnificently assembled ensemble,"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.

12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.

The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.

12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason.",10

12 June 2016,"It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from an ordinary premise.","Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade. Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long. (Joseph Sweeney).",10
28 May 2007,Greatest movie ever made,"Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.

Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.

12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.

Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.

The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.

To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.

Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.

Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.

Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.

Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.

Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.

Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.

Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.

Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.

Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.

Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.

Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.

Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.

Highly recommended.",10

19 May 2022,Thought provoking olden masterpiece,"I have been putting this movie off for later because of how old it is. But yesterday when I had nothing to watch I decided to watch it. And now I am glad that I watched it. This movie works in a very different way. At times you might get to know where the talks are going but there will also be times when you will be wrong too.

All instances in movie look super good. Especially for a movie that takes place in just one room it is too good. After watching a lot of modern movies a flick this olden masterpiece can make you feel real good about olden times.

Give it a try, your 96 minutes will be worth it.

23 November 2021,I wish I could rate this 12 stars,"A superb movie, and hard to believe it was released over 60 years ago. Anyway, 12 Angry Men is the legal studies movie of our time, and makes you wonder what really goes on in the sanctity of the jury room.

There needs to be a reboot, perhaps a British one that can feature the acclaimed British actor Danny Dyer who spouts ""init?"" as he questions the guilt of the accused.

Another reboot could be 12 Angry People that includes a diverse cast, male, female, Hispanics, LGBTI.

10 December 2018,I Felt Like a 13th Juror,"Amazing amazing amazing movie. I am totally shocked. I was blown away.

I saw the high rating of this movie and thought it would be good but it's a movie from 1957 so how good are we talking. Then as the movie started I see 12 white male jurors go into jury chambers to decide the fate of either an Italian or Latino teen. Instantly, I thought, ""I'm going to hate this movie."" And as the subtle and not so subtle personality traits and ideologies of some of the men became known I thought, ""I'm really going to hate this movie.""

But not so fast my fine movie-going friend. The 1950's just may be able to surprise you. And that it did. This movie about the American justice system and the power of jurors who take justice seriously is a tremendous tribute and example of what justice should be.

The entire unfolding of the movie was so realistic: the yelling, the arguing, the soapbox preaching, the prejudices, the practical, the impractical, the logical, the emotional, those who cared, those who couldn't careless, it was flat out real. They couldn't have done a better job with the characters, the writing, and the acting. 12 jurors in a stuffy jury room deliberating upon the fate of a man accused of murder and one man upsetting the balance--you can imagine the fury, frustration, impatience, misunderstanding, and impertinence. It was a recipe for disaster.

It's been a while since I've actively partook in a movie to this degree. What do I mean? I mean that I'm a bit of an audible movie watcher. I will ooh and aah and make comments here and there but most movies don't elicit much from me. I found myself watching this movie and all but becoming a 13th juror. I was shouting, ""Yes!"" ""You tell 'im!"" ""That's right!"" ""Oh!"" and other comments reserved for a sermon or a sporting event. I was truly awed at the brilliance and direction of the movie/jury deliberations. Only if every jury in American history were as good as this one.",10
5 August 2022,One of film history's finest,"You'll get films, then you'll get '12 Angry Men'. To put it as simply as possible, '12 Angry Men' is a cinematic phenomena. The alluring screenplay, astonishing direction, and memorable performances, especially Henry Fonda's character, are all something you must experience atleast once in a lifetime. Thank you Sidney Lumet for such a fantastic film. He gave us the likes of other cinematic phenomena such as 'Serpico' (1973), and 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975) which are also just as striking as '12 Angry Men', both essential viewings. Once again, please, please, please give yourself the chance to witness this coup de grace.

7 April 2009,"""You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?""","A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.

Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy.",10
25 August 2005,Great actors; somewhat preachy script; still worth watching,"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...

Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.

A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".

Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.

My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.

Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.

Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!",7
2 January 2008,true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good,"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.

The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.

If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.

21 September 2001,Riveting but problematic,"I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them.

When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie! I fear it takes on more than it can handle. But what a worthy effort!",
7 March 2022,PERFECT,"I don't usually say this very often, but this movie is indeed perfect . Not only in terms of storytelling but also cinematography and camera movement, this film does it all. It's start with an interesting premise , that is executed flawlessy , with a lot of very suspenful and very satisfyng scenes and by the end , you will be pleasantly surprised from all points of view. This movie not only tells a very good story on paper, but also the camera that tells its own story being accompanied by the play of the actors, which is again perfect. So we have a flawless story, a 10 out of 10 cinematografy and one of the best performances I've ever seen, it's impossible not to say that 12 angry old men is one of the best movies ever made.

11 August 2020,Minimalist masterpiece,"This film is very minimalist in its construction. There are only twelve characters who deliberate in a jury room. From this very simple premise, it unfolds into a masterpiece that really showcases the depths of the characters and their views on the case. The acting performances are amazing and really play off each other. We never really know how it is going to turn out and there are plenty of twists.

7 August 2005,Benefit of Hindsight,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

20 August 2019,A must watch classic,"Twelve angry men is a courtroom drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film is an adaptation of a teleplay by Reginald of the same name.

The story tells about jury of 12 men who discuss the conviction or acquittal of an 18 year old boy who is charged for the murder of his father and as per US in criminal case the verdict of jury must be unanimous.

This is one of the most beautiful and edge of the seat movie with great acting direction and screenplay.

This is one of the most thought provoking movie which is beautifully and majorly this movie shows us nothing of the trial but only the 12 jury members and their arguments.

This is undoubtedly one of the entertaining court room drama which is a must watch.",9

9 June 2015,12 Character Studies,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",8
19 August 2022,"Need I not to say, the Best BLACK n WHITE film I've ever seen!","Outstanding script! A film which had no action, just dialogues yet gripping enough to keep the pace going. What an absolute MASTERPIECE!

The acting by all 12 of the Jurors is perfect. Every character is different. They all perform so well that you can easily identify 12 different people in a single room.

Absolutely great direction and the best thing is Dialogue Writing. Bravo!

27 April 2022,When in doubt,"I give 10/10 to 1 of 100 movies. When they're perfect. And this has no flaws whatsoever, in it's ""easy"" story. Cause it's easy. A murderer, 12 who will or will not centence him. 11 for, 1 against. It's a story about will. Henry Fonda is both irritating and convincing, but in the end, you know he is right. Can you convict someone when there's doubt? Fonda's character refuse to follow the sheep heard, and it's interesting how he sways the others. Some get annoyed, infuriating, cause this is ""only"" jury duty, and doesnt concern them. Others starts to ask questions. In many ways it reminds me of one of my favorite movies, To Kill A Mockingbird, were Gregory Peck does the same thing, only as a defence attorney. I only give 10/10 to a movie so flawless I cant think of any way it could be done better. I rest my case. It's guilty for being a flawless masterpiece.

9 August 2022,Interesting and enthralling courtroom drama,"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.

One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?

The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.

If you want to experience the power of cinema, regardless of your age, gender and cultural upbringing, watch this - you won't regret it.",9
17 March 2019,The best courtroom drama ever made,"This is one of the greatest movies not only of the 1950s, but of all time. What makes it unique are the direction, the actors' performances, the cinematography and the set. In my opinion, whoever loves classic movies or movies in general should watch this movie at least once in a lifetime - it's that great and perfect! This movie should be even shown in film schools as a textbook example of how to make a movie without special effects but only with a good script and talented actors. That's it: a movie shot in black and white and for almost all the time the film is set in a small room.

The direction (by Sidney Lumet in his debut) is top-notch and the actors' performances are all career-bests. Henry Fonda has never given a better performance than the one he gives in this movie, and all the other actors - Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Robert Webber, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler for naming a few - who were still unknown at the time, are great here and give great support to Fonda. All in all, an exceptional movie in all ways.",10
17 July 2022,Speechless,"I did not expect to be so glued to my screen for a duration of 90 minutes and just seeing 12 old men argue but boy i was wrong, even though it was set in a single room, it's shockingly entertaining, it felt like i was in the jury too.

12 March 2022,absolutely great movie and brilliant,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human.

17 January 2019,A real classic with great dialogues,"There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.

The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.

7 June 2019,A Nearly Perfect Film from Start to Finish,"This is a movie that has no gunfights, explosions, car chases, or epic set pieces, but it still remains one of the tensest, most exhilarating films in cinematic history. This is a movie that works based solely on the performances of the actors, the dialogue scribed by the writers, and the direction of Sidney Lumet. Almost the entirety of the film is set in one room, but Lumet uses a variety of techniques to create different feelings of claustrophobia and isolation all within the confines of that room. It's a movie that makes you wait with bated breath as these men with eclectic backgrounds try to determine the fate of one man.

30 January 2022,Near The Acme Of Cinema,"At its core 12 Angry Men is like an ode to the American legal system and justice in general. All twelve of the characters are what you might call cliches or stereotypes, but really they're reflections of society and of course they're played terrifically by the actors in the film. Of whom what more can say other than they're all excellent.

The film and play its adapted from is a masterful work in writing and why it is what it is. However, don't let the impressive script and performances prevent you from noticing what a fine job Sydney Lumet did.

It's nice to see this film receiving the recognition it deserves from so many, here it's rated #5 (a bit high for my taste), and those doubtful of how intresting a dozen guys yelling at each other can be, will probably be in for a surprise.

31 January 2022,Incredible,"12 Angry Men is proof that you don't need any bells or whistles to make a practically perfect film.

What seems like a relatively simple premise develops into one of the most engrossing and intelligent screenplays I've ever seen. The dialogue is so well thought out, the characters crafted to perfection. Every story beat, every revelation, every examination of evidence is played out to perfection.

Needless to say the performances are stellar, which elevates the film to a whole other level.

What more is there to say? Perfect.

9 September 2017,The best film of it's type,"There's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. While it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. All the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here.

7 September 2022,Guilty or not guilty?,"This is always worth a watch. Supremely acted across the board with special mention to Jack Warden and Joseph Sweeney. The tension mounts as the movie progresses as Henry Fonda puts doubt into the heads of his fellow jurors.

The problem I have always had is that Henry convinces every single person to change their minds regardless of hoe utterly convinced they are of their original opinion. I find this unrealistic, but it doesn't spoil the movie and it is still well worth watching. Oh, and for what it's worth I thought the boy was guilty!! Maybe Henry would have changed my mind, but I doubt it.

23 June 2021,An Impressive Oldie-but-a-Goodie,"It's absolutely amazing how entertaining it is to witness twelve men in a single room, arguing and specifying for 90 minutes straight. Do not judge this movie by it's age, because it is an unforgettable and truthful black-and-white classic that's always worth checking into.

Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are phenomenal in the film. To call the cast excellent is quite common, but 12 Angry Men's cast manage to pull off a stunning jury system and keep us all engaged and impressed. So don't start the film with extremely low hopes. The first 10 minutes is just settling you into the story and once the conversation, arguing and yelling starts, it'll latch your attention and hold you until the end. It's pretty simple, but is a fast masterpiece to be classed as one of history's best films.

Although it's appropriate and clean from adult elements, it's honestly worth having the younger children wait until they're older kids. Unless your young kids are genuinely interested, save this black-and-white masterpiece as a must-watch for when they're older. Young children will likely find the film boring and old, but older kids may have more fascination.

12 Angry Men is a perfect example of just needing a simple script, a terrific crew, and a decent setting. Don't focus on how old it is and definitely go and see it if you have not watched it.

21 May 2023,Lays it on a little thick,"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.

The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.

Don't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson? Especially when Hollywood isn't any better than the rest of us.

23 February 2008,"Wonderful character portrayals, but too preachy","Henry Fonda is the star here, but the other roles are filled by legendary character actors. To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head. That being said, it is enjoyable for the acting and a must see for those who have missed it so far.

9 September 2008,Simply engrossing.,"12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a ""reasonable doubt"" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.

Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.

For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.

Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.",9
16 December 2016,"A simple, timeless classic","It just goes to show, you can have the largest budget, the greatest special effects and the most explosive action, but all a film really needs is a great script and a great cast, and '12 Angry Men' is a testament to that. Despite being over 60 years old now, this is rightly still considered by many to be one of the best films of all time.

Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.

The characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities. The script is also excellent, a masterpiece in itself.

This is one of the simplest films ever made, but it's also one of the best. '12 Angry Men' is a timeless classic that will live long in the memory.",10
2 February 2020,Greatest,"One of the best movies every made. This movie has one of the deepest stories, and best of all no violence. You are just taken on the journey, along with the jury to figure out what really happened, and ponder on the philosophical questions of accidentally imprisoning an innocent man.

20 November 2021,"Nobody knows the truth, and anything is possible.","However, collective intelligence and laborious pursuit of the truth itself sometimes take people near the truth. Twelve jurors are simplified integration of almost all types of people you can see in real life. Emotional one, smart one, reasonable one, wise one, rambling one, indecisive one, coward one, quiet one, loud one, and etc. I have never seen a movie with such a limited story and the setting. The whole move takes place in one setting: jurors' room and has one simple narrative: deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. However, it contains the whole society: how one's conviction can work in right or wrong way, what it takes to change others' opinions, what percentage of proportion is perfect between conviction and possibility, and how an individual deems 'the life'.

One thing I have particularly noticed is the temperature in the room and the weather outside. Because the room is stuffed, and all jurors are sweating, stress, pressure and unpleasantness in decision making process is thoroughly conveyed to the audience. The level of griminess peaks when the vote reaches six to six. Then, it rains, and a fan starts to work, forecasting pleasant momentum toward resolution or settlement. I also want to praise the camera work. It intensifies the sense of confined space without disturbing actors' delivery of emotion. When it is the vital moment of discovery of evidence, the camera closes up the actor with the line. However, other times, scenes are shot across the room vertically, emphasizing the narrowness with many people overlapping some parts of their body.

I will not deny '12 Angry Men' is philosophical art. However, it does not do enough to overcome the weakness this movie is born with, no dynamics and too linear because of finite story and setting. It misses out on most of what 'motion pictures' can offer.",7

8 April 2021,And justice for one,"The life is made up of choices we make every single day, from small things like what to eat for breakfast and what movie to watch in spare time to the big things like the vacation plans or mortgage engagements. We are so used to choosing we do it instantaneously, without any further investigations - and that is often the case with the things we think are right because if we are right it means that everyone else who thinks differently is wrong. People were, are and will always be stubborn and narrow-minded because they are a majority and one can only guess what will happen when that changes.

1957's ""12 angry men"" is a splendid courtroom drama which was a directorial debut for Sidney Lumet and starred an ensemble cast of great actors - Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and many others. The film is set almost entirely in one room where the jury must decide whether a man on trial for murder is guilty and it showcases all there is to love about the art of cinema: tensions, eloquent and well-thought out dialogues, outstanding performances, masterful camera work and most of all - the presence effect.

Together with the jurors we examine every piece of evidence, every statement, every witness so that not only they can come to the unanimous conclusion but also to put ourselves in the shoes of a person convicted and admit that there is a reasonable doubt and to state so in our final judgment, and it's no easy task. It's not difficult to stand out from the crowd but it's so much harder to stoop down to it everytime you're pressured into thinking, doing, believing something or behaving the way the rest is - you have to stand firmly where you are and be a human no matter what and maybe, just maybe, the angry people around you will see the whole picture more clearly.

This motion picture tells us not to rush to conclusions despite how convinced we are of our rightness because there's always more than meets the eye and truly good things always take time.",10

27 March 2021,Twelve men. One room. One masterpiece.,"This is regarded as one of the best films ever made and I see why.

12 Angry Men is about a jury of twelve men who decide whether a boy is guilty of a murder or not. Everyone finds him guilty except for Juror 8 who believes there's reasonable doubt leading the rest of the jury to question their decisions.

By the end of its 96 minute runtime, I was completely blown away. For a film so limited in scale, I couldn't believe how suspenseful and incredible this film was. The majority of this film takes place in one room and it's masterful how well made it is. As the opening credits roll, Sidney Lumet tracks the camera in one single take, introducing us to every character and helping us get a first impression of what they're like. It's an outstanding beginning that establishes Lumet's talent. Lumet makes use of the one location to its full potential. The way some scenes are shot and edited make for some extremely tension filled moments that managed to surprise me in every way. There is not a single dull moment. As it progresses, the suspense goes up a notch leaving my eyes glued to the screen for its entirety. It's especially impressive considering this was Lumet's feature film debut. Could you get a better debut than this?!

For a film taking place in one room, a lot of dialogue is thrown around in what I consider to be one of the best scripts to ever be written. Reginald Rose's script astounds me. Not only am I dazzled by the way Rose unfolds this case but also how much it revealed certain details about the characters. He's very smart in framing the opinions of each of the men and why they have that opinion, leading to some emotionally powerful scenes that disclose reasons as to why some members think the boy is guilty excluding the evidence presented. This is a script that writers will dream of writing and I have to praise Reginald Rose for achieving this feat. Aside from the script and direction, the performances is the icing on the cake. Every single person puts their best foot forward and delivers incredible performances. Henry Fonda stands out as Juror 8 and is extremely compelling to watch. Lee J. Cobb is another standout who gets better and better as the film continues. Bit by bit, we learn how troubled of a person he is and Cobb steals the show during those intense scenes.

I now see why 12 Angry Men is loved so much. This is a film and ensemble piece that has it all. It's outstanding on every single level whether it's the performances, the script or the direction. This is a work of art that should be watched by everyone!",10
13 March 2022,Perfection,"This movie is just perfect and i usually don't give movies 10/10 but this movie is just different. And for such a low budget black and white movie it truly shows how good a movie can get just based on its plot instead of cinematics and the cgi used nowadays. The plot was really good and the characters were so well acted and how they made such stubborn characters change their mind 10/10 movie.

8 March 2016,Good but quite preachy,"A man (played by Henry Fonda) on the jury for a murder trial is not content with the verdict his fellow jurors is heading for. He sets out to show to them what actually occurred and why they're wrong.

Good, but not the all-time classic it is made out to be. The plot is not entirely plausible, and dialogue was often quite preachy. So preachy at times I thought the courts could use the movie in their instructional and ""inspiration"" videos on the jury system!

Good acting, mostly, though some of the actors playing the minor characters irritated me, by soapboxing.

The movie did bring back some memories. I once served on a murder trial jury (one involving a knife, coincidentally), so I found some of the parallels quite intriguing.

24 July 2010,"Unlikely, but it is possible.","12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.

Sweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.

A lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10",9

4 March 2022,Writing is the most important part of this film,"This film deserves its #5 spot on the top 250 best films of all time (According to IMDb). And there is one thing that I noticed about this film. Everything great is because of the writing. The acting, Emotions, Characters, Plot, personal self-enjoyment, and even the cinematography are all vastly improved by the writing. The acting is excellent but without such a great script all of it would seem unrealistic. For example, see some of the scenes in the star wars prequels. I believe that some of the people who acted in them were good actors but had horrible dialogue written by George Lucas that made their acting look awful. For example, I haven't seen it but Hayden Christensen is known for having a great performance in the film ""Shattered Glass"" Made in 2003 but since his most popular films are badly written, he is known as a bad actor. This films writing however made all of these actors well known for being some of the best of their time.

The emotional core of this film is driven by the writing and although that might seem obvious to you, other people may still think it's driven by the excellent acting, but don't realize that the acting is driven by the writing.

The characters in this film are some of the best I, and most people (who have seen this film) have ever seen. We start the film in a room with 12 strangers and get to know them over time until the point where they feel like real humans and you don't feel like you're watching a film anymore. Once again the writing is the main attribute but this time it's driven by the acting and the writing. I will admit that even with this excellent writing you can still have a bad performance.

I've seen a few people saying this is boring, but I have no idea how you could ever think that. The premise might seem boring, you may ask ""Why one room for 99% of the film?"". But trust me and almost everybody else when I say that this is not boring at all. The writing and the plot make this a very enjoyable drama/mystery film. Whenever you see a film, don't assume that it's boring, read the plot, look at the genre, and decide if it will be your thing.

Lastly, the cinematography in this film. It's very creative and has a lot of hidden things in it. For example, (SPOILERS HERE) When Juror 7 (Henry Fonda) slowly convinces more people, the camera moves down because he is becoming the boss and he is now above everybody else, but at the beginning the camera is above him, showing how everybody else is above him. (END OF SPOILERS) Now that is really cool and the writing helped make that possible.

Overall, as I said at the beginning this is truly one of the best films of all time and it deserves its place on the IMDb top 5. It's a masterpiece and it goes straight into my top 10. This is my longest review yet so I hope you liked it. Goodbye! 9.8/10.

30 January 2021,It only takes one articulate juror....,"12 angry men. I've always thought the jury system was imperfect - 12 people from the general population - none of them lawyers, and most if not all, by the laws of probability,,not versed in legal idiosyncrasies. It only takes one very strong, articulate and confident juror to be able to convince the other 11. None of them are trained. It's all pretty much based on gut feeling. And most of us are sheep. Even though I've always thought - via my untrained instinct - that the jury system was fundamentally flawed, I've never really seen it challenged in film or conveyed in such a powerful way as 12 angry men did. Not only was the film entertaining on a theatrical level, it also rings true today. Is there a better system to judge guilt or innocence? I don't know. But this film demonstrates that the current system (bear in mind this was released in 1957) is anything but foolproof. A thought provoking yet entertaining 8 out of ten

1 January 2008,"""Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.""","Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities. Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera-work; removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines. What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.

Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration.

What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an ""open-and-shut case."" Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others.

It would be plain naïve to label any one of the twelve jurors a ""villain,"" but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority.

Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations  purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door  would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.",10

6 November 2020,Great actors and acting,"I agree with many of the reviews- less is more, great cast of actors. Love the premise of just following the jury in the room. Honestly after the first 30 minutes you could kind of tell where this story line was headed and it wasn't much of a surprise at the end. I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away. I will have to watch it again one day and see if I have a different opinion since everyone else seems enthralled with this movie. For me it was worth watching, but would not be anywhere near my top 20 best films ever.

Everything about this film is pure excellence. A genius script by Reginald Rose, fantastic acting - especially by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. It really is the simplicity of the story that makes the film shine.

Add to that the theoretical complexities of the subject matter and a great classic is born - and it certainly was in 1957.

26 September 2009,"Compact, vivid, progressive--not a civics lesson, but a study of human nature","12 Angry Men (1957)

What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.

It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.

As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?

The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.

Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a ""slum"" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.

Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense.

I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.",9

9 March 2018,12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details.,"Released in 1957, this is about a group of jurors deciding the fate of a young boy who is accused of murder. One man believes he is not guilty and attempts to convince the rest of the jurors of his innocence. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room...it's just so tight!! The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film (at that time) was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty...it's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law! Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.",10

This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in ""Citizen Kane"". A brilliant piece of film making.

14 August 1998,I'm not angry with 12 Angry Men,"Sidney Lumet's first film is one of his best. Of course, it helps to have people like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley. It's great because you never know the names of the any of the jurors until the end. When you see this one, watch for the opening shot. It continues for I don't know how long. Its amazing how you are kept glued to the screen throughout, despite the fact that they never leave the juror room and they continue talking and talking. Yet, it fascinates you. At the beginning, you don't know a thing about the case. In the end you know every little detail. It may bore some, but I sure liked it.

25 February 2017,Brilliant Group dynamics,"I will not go in normal review of the movie. It had been brilliant. There were loopholes, but not in the plot, but in the prosecution. There are more than reasonable doubt of the boy being not guilty and he most certainly was, along with the points made by the defense (jurors) there were several other missed points, which the stories said, but weren't used for defense. The movie brilliantly brings out, when the cops wants to make a scapegoat of someone who doesn't have means to defend, how easily they can. The defense lawyer, as mentioned during discussions, was an unwilling completely disinterested and somehow wanted to go over the ordeal. Probably a case of 'Court Appointed' - a la ""You volunteer"" of An Officer And A gentleman. The glaring inconsistencies, which the juror noticed, and some they didn't were not noticed by him. However that isn't the brilliance of the movie, but it is its real life depiction of a upper echelon policy meeting, especially Board Meetings of a company. I am in a position vouch for that. Probably, if not already, this movie should be a part of mandatory curriculum of any business school. There the CEO has brought an agenda, ably supported by his/her team (the prosecutors). It is in Board, and usually the way it happens, all are very convinced of the power point presentation and the golden future the schemes will lead to. Unless one has a doubt and express it, the scheme will move on, till probably it is too late (boy past and beyond chair).

It is only when one says ""I am not too sure"" the discussions take place and various lacunae and wrong assumptions come to surface. In business, those are taken (sometimes) positively to plug the loopholes and polish the proposal (here of course there were no midway) but still the dynamics of a business meeting was replicated. The members with their own personal opinions (back grounds, prejudices), changing courts, on one side and again on other side, as the respective prejudices were addressed by the two opposing camps. Though all the background of each were not clearly brought out, but still one could guess, from their prejudices. Change the topic, and as I said it is a board meet.

On the lighter side. this movie is strangely devoid of feminine presence. In the whole movie, leave aside jurors, there are not a single member of the fair gender credited or un-credited. In fact only two women ever get referred to, first being one of the star witnesses and the other one of the juror's wife.",10
18 September 2019,A timeless classic,"An excellent example of movie making that is impressive and still holds up to this day. The camera movement, the long shots, the composition and actor movements are executed to perfection, making this viewing a one of a kind. The story is gripping, revolving around a murder trial of a Latino boy accused of killing his father and the twelve men who will decide his faith. The cast does a great job with the portrayal of the various jurors and the complex reasons they lean to one verdict or the other presenting us with twelve massively different characters each with his own flaws and his own views of morality and human nature. An amazing feat of cinema rightfully considered on of the crown jewels of Old Hollywood.

20 July 2022,A true classic that's ranked among my favorite films!,"This is one of those movies that proves that special effects and insane action sequences are not needed for a film to be at least good. This film stands out from most of the rest in the ""old film"" department. Filled with amazing acting (Fonda's and Cobb's stood out to me in particular), brilliant writing, and its creative use of just very few movies sets, 12 Angry Men is a movie I'd watch again and again, capturong each layer of a message that shows that even when the odds seem entirely against you, there's always a chance.

17 April 2021,They showed this when I was on Jury Service,"Tarrant County Jury Services shows highlights from ""12 Angry Men"" to impress on you how important it is. However, I have already watched this movie several times. Even though I know the outcome it is interesting to speculate as to what the message each juror is trying to express.

Of course, just about all of Henry Fonda's performances are exceptional and in this one you see him sweat. The real tension in this movie is the interaction between the jurors. Even though you mostly focus on Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, there is not a wasted juror as you can see from the cast list.

There are several similar movies including a remake, ""12 Angry Men (1997)""; however, this classic is the rod by which all others are measured.

22 November 2014,The Best Courtroom-Drama Ever Made!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
7 August 2022,Wonderful.,"I'm not really a fan of black & white movies, and not really interested in a movie which's summed up in only one set of location. So I had doubts in planning to watch it in first place. However, it turned out the complete opposite. Actors' amazing performances and the dialogues which involved rage, panic, confusion, and switches of emotions, had to require a lot of efforts and talent from the actors. Which they give their all for it. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, most importantly for its great scenario, and actors' performance, and being joyful to watch for the complete duration.

17 November 2020,12 Angry Men,"Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.

The thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.

I also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.

For a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.

12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating. I loved that as soon as it started raining the fan started working. And I loved that it stopped raining as soon as they left the court building. To put it simply, I loved everything about this film.",10
12 December 2015,One of Cinema's Best Courtroom Dramas!,"12 Angry Men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema. Even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. On the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. I was discussing in an earlier review (Dial M for Murder) about the use of a single location. Well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. Outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom. That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman. The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. Lumet later discussed how a ""lens plot"" occurred to him. As the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. A very good technique I must point out.

Another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don't know much about the case, only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on. All we know is that a Spanish-American boy is accused of murdering his father. Other than a very bored-looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case, we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors. In most courtroom movies, it's clear they like to come to a final verdict. This movie is very different because we don't know whether the boy is guilty or not, although we can assume based off the events of the movie. The movie is all about reasonable evidence, a very important study in criminal justice. Through the evidence depicted in the case, did the boy commit the murder or not? In the first few minutes in the jury room, it's clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty. However, there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision. The problem is that one juror, Juror #8 believes the boy is not guilty. This is where all the fun begins. The film is based on emotion, logic, and even prejudice to describe what is going on. This particular juror does not sway from his opinion, even though the other jurors are growing more angry, more restless. But as Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) describes why he believes the boy is not guilty, and he presents an admirable case why, people begin to agree with #8. There are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons. For example, Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is an extreme racist, as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. Then there is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with #8. Then there is Juror #4 (E.G Marshall), a man with wire-rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic. I think it was a wise movie not to give the character names. It makes each character much more powerful. I could actually remember the juror by their numbers, That's a testament for how great and unique each character is.

In the 95 minutes the film runs, we become invested in each character very much so. Whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right, we truly sympathize with them all. That is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast. It's interesting, because there was only one bankable star here (at the time), and that was Henry Fonda who played Juror #8 very well. He presented his case as believable as he can be. The rest of the cast were some of the best actors of New York City at the time, such as Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Klugman, E.G Marshall, John Fiedler, Edward Binns, Robert Webber, and George Voskovec. They all perform very well in their roles. They need to be angry, and they certainly did get angry.

Sidney Lumet is one of the best and influential American directors of all time. This was is first feature film, and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene. In each film he does, he always has something to say-usually something controversial. Not so much in this film, but in subsequent films. He does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people, and cause them to think and act irrationally. As some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out.

12 Angry Men, based off a television play, ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made. It came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty. Despite the critical acclaim of this film, the movie actually wasn't a box-office hit when it originally opened. But enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is. It spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men, and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful, influential film.

My Grade: A",9
18 December 2002,The Architecture Of the Human Face,"I love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. The play is so intensely written, and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating.

At the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. It's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. It's here that Mr. Rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while I'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole.

If ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. Every actor gives a superb performance. Some characters are better conceived than others, and thus John Fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and Ed Binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. Ed Begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. Martin Balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden's loudmouth salesman. I've never seen Warden better than he is here. His character is a jerk and a joker, borderline Runyon, or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. Warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. E.G. Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. Not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. Lee J. Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while Henry Fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. Cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing.

What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. We see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes. Some faces smile automatically, others benignly, some not at all. With so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures, it would be good for young directors to study 12 Angry Men, to see just how much action there is in the human face. I'll take this one over Pearl Harbor any old day.",10
16 October 2022,A Vindication of Doubt and Inquiry,"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.

What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes.

11 December 2001,"ACLU claptrap, yet an engrossing picture; angelic Fonda is unbearably smarmy","It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off. 11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony. He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt."" Guess who triumphs?

The movie is remarkable. Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.

The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.

Yet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable.

It's searing, yet dopey.",6

13 January 2009,Greatest movie ever,"No sex, no graphic violence, no swearing, no nudity? Wow, what a concept. Great cast. Simple basic use your imagination and follow all the characters. Exceptional script. Dialog and body language were perfectly timed. You just don't find a super combination of talent, story line, directing, etc. any better then in this movie. I never get tired of watching this and find something new to focus on every time I watch this. This is real acting. Most folks now a days would not appreciate or understand the power of this presentation. Now a days if it is not graphic, gory or vulgar people don't understand or get it. This movie wakes up and treats all the senses to something really special. Well, if you don't understand or have not experienced what I am talking about I do feel sorry for you because you are really missing out on something.

9 December 2018,"A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room","As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.

12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.

12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.

Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.

Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.

As one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.",9
28 August 2016,"Wow, what an amazing movie","I do have a penchant for older movies but this one is special. It perfectly highlights how keeping it ""smart and simple"" is the right way to go. The entire movie was basically shot in one room with 12 people arguing about a case. With that being said it was just as intense as any car chase. If you like seeing how people logically deconstruct a case in order to prove/disprove the defendants guilt this is the right movie for you. At first the whole case appears to be pretty ""black and white"" but as the jury (the 12 men) discusses details about the night of the murder new conclusions are being drawn. Conclusions that ultimately make them question their original standpoint. ""Is the boy really guilty?"" Watch the movie and find out.

5 June 2022,Simplistic but rightfully so,"This movie is pretty brilliant. It is so simple and neat with one simple concept. It is not too long so it never get's boring. Small almost incignificent changes in the movie makes it interesting. And at the same time you are finding out more about the entire murder case, and how racism and sterotypes can break a good democracy. I really do like the touches like how the camera zooms in gardually over time. With really nice actors with somewhat conving diolog it makes you want to watch till the end.

It's simply brilliant. But it doesn't have anything to make it exciting or something that I would want to watch again, or being able to watch over and over again. But I do understand that some people really like this movie, hard to explain.

16 November 2019,A movie with no cheap tricks and out of immersion experiences.,"If truly love movies and character development and seeing faces react and incorporate true human emotions. You will thoroughly enjoy this classic. I recently went back to this film to really put myself in a time where this was needed to make movies riveting.

All the characters are highly believable for the given time period and their reasoning for believing or not believing is completely believable as well. It warmed my heart to hear each character say something that fit their characters so well.

I honestly cannot see whats to hate about this film unless you are against B&W movies and you have to have only action in your movies.

8 June 2022,Good movies,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.",10

25 February 2021,12 Angry Men,"Pretty good and interesting movie. It is well directed, with some minor flaws that could have been avoided. The idea itself is good, and the film is interesting enough to hold the viewer's attention to the end. The acting is not bad, it varies from great to mediocre, overall it is pretty good. Some things will seem a little naive, but the time in which it was filmed should be taken into account. An interesting film worth watching.

27 October 2008,Reasonable Doubt...,"The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.

It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.

The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).

Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.

The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.

I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.

4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so. Strongly recommended.",9
3 May 2019,Never gets old or should I say older the better,"I have watched this movie at least 3 times with 2-3yrs gap and still enjoy watching it again. The minds behind these 12 angry men makes it more interesting than ever.

21 February 2019,One more scene would have made this movie complete,"An excellent 10-star well-acted and well-written movie.

12 Angry Men began with the court, judge, jury and defendant awaiting deliberation.

The movie should have ended with the court, judge, jury and defendant hearing the final verdict. This would have made the movie perfect. It is the responses from all involved in the court room that complete a movie. Sudden quick endings leave a feeling of incompleteness. I wanted to see the boy's reaction to the verdict, just as you saw him before the verdict. Then my rating would have been a 10, instead of a 7.

3 December 2021,Good legal drama,"Good legal drama but the evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. Did they really make the correct decision?",7
3 September 2022,The Best Courtroom film Ever,"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.

This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.

In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond). This film is not the best Sidney Lumet film (Murder on the Orient Express). It's not even the best Martin Balsam (Juror #1) film (Psycho). But it's one of my favorite films, Easily a 10/10.",
5 May 2022,The finest of wines,"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die: #1

I'm gonna do a series where I go through all the films in this book (2013 edition), because I often feel like I don't watch enough classic movies. There's just so bloody many throughout history that asking me to pick one at any given time is damn near impossible for me, so having a pre-made list like this is incredibly helpful to that end. So I'm going through them, in alphabetical order rather than chronologically because I think jumping around to different time periods will keep it much more fresh.

And to kick things off, even though a big reason for me doing this is that I say I haven't seen enough classics, we've got one that's been one of my favourites for nearly two years now. 12 Angry Men is a film that I consider to be nothing short of a miracle, frankly. Of all the pre-1960's films I've seen (which is not all that many to be honest), I haven't enjoyed a huge amount of them (although others include Paths Of Glory and Casablanca). I've always thought that back then, while the acting could be amazing, they just don't tend to have particularly interesting narratives or characters, and the directing pales in comparison to what directors have been doing since.

Which only makes it even more amazing to me that I can't say any of that about 12 Angry Men. Not only is it pristinely directed, edited, and shot, and one of, if not the best written courtroom drama ever made, but aside from a few minor references to 50's culture, you could release this exact same film today, word for word, and it would still work. It feels like it's barely aged a day.

And when I say pristinely directed, I mean that. The way Sidney Lumet frames whoever's talking, and allows the camera to follow them around, is just perfect. And some shots where no one is talking are some of the most memorable in the film, and some (including me) would even extend that to ""in cinematic history"". He also brilliantly used close ups more and more as the script went on, which is a simple thing, but it does wonders for the atmosphere. As does the fact there's almost no soundtrack for the entire movie. And the fact that it's nearly entirely set in one room. And the pacing being flawless.

It's a really damn good film, you know?

And something else that makes it just that good: the performances. Every single one of them. There are some that are given less of a chance to shine than others because they're more side characters, yes, but at their worst they do what they need to do and are convincing as these jurors that don't get as much of a spotlight.

At best...oh man, Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, and more, every single one of them is sodding phenomenal, and the way the script so geniusly creates tension by giving virtually everyone a good and understandable (or sometimes, not so good or understandable) reason for their initial guilty verdicts is brilliant. It means that everyone has a different little thing that'll convince them otherwise, and Henry Fonda's search for all of them is riveting.

I also love how much of a moral quandary the whole film could be, as one of the jurors says fairly early on: ""suppose the kid did knife his father and you talk us out of it?"", and how shockingly relevant it is. It made comments on systematic racism and arguably toxic masculinity in 1950-bloody-7 for christ's sake!

Like I said, I really do consider this film, especially for it to have been made in the time period it was, nothing short of a miracle, and if you've never seen it, then like...man, go watch it! Like, now, ideally.",10

18 July 2022,People who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers.,"""12 Angry Men"" A chamber film about self-discovery.

""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!

I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.

And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me. I remembered only people who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers. And it is stronger than any multiverse.",10
25 March 2022,Great Movie,"Probably a movie that can't be replaced or remaked,a movie that changed everything and strated something in the world of movies. This movie is telling us that there are some great directors whit a different vision. Great actors whit different characters, you can see the chemistry between them while their talking and screaming,you can see how powerful is self expression and the power of convincement and how someone's words can change your mind forever. This movie is about listening and maturity,every character in this movie has a profesion and different thinking about life but they end up being the same as the other guys in the room. Beautiful movie,if you try to understand their sayings and vision you will love this movie, you need to watch beyond the script and belive me you will learn something from this movie.

21 February 2012,Quality work all around.,"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.

The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.

Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.",7
19 April 2020,One of the best of all time!,"This film still stands the test of time after more than 60 years.

1 August 2003,Masterpiece Nearing Perfection,"It has been described as ""flawless"", ""immaculate"" and ""supreme"" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.",8
25 June 2008,Masterpiece,"12 Angry Men (1957)

**** (out of 4)

A poor slum kid is on trial for the murder of his father and it's up to one juror (Henry Fonda) to try and convince the other's that he's not guilty. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Bins, Jack Warden, Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are the twelve jurors and it's going to be hard trying to find a film with as much great acting as what we see here. I really think this is one of the greatest screenplays to be written for any movie since the movie only runs 96-minutes and we've got all the evidence to listen to and watch them discuss it but we also get to know each one of them personally with just a few remarks, which tells us everything about them. Another important aspect is the direction by Lumet, which might be the best of his career, which is certainly saying a lot considering how many great films he has made over the years. There's nothing getting blown up here and there are no gunshots but this film, in terms of drama and suspense, can rival any action movie ever made for those edge of your seat thrills. The cinematography is also top-notch as the camera just floats around the juror's room picking up pieces of the action. What I love most about movies is when you get great actors going at each other in a great screenplay and I can't think of a movie that does this better than this one right here. There is so much excitement as the men, who all believe they are right, slowly fight and tear away at one another until the thrilling end. All of the performances are wonderful and what better than having a mild Fonda going up against the anger of Cobb. The final sequence is brilliantly handled and doesn't come off as forced or silly. On the top this is certainly a courtroom drama but underneath the film plays more like a lesson of this countries legal Constitution and why it is so great.",
7 July 2019,A timeless classic relevant in any time period,"12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.

A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.

Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.

22 July 2018,From 1 against 11 to 11 against 1 in one the most brilliant films in history!,"I do not often start my reviews with blunt and opinionated statements, but in this case, it's justified. ""12 Angry Men"" is righteously considered as one of the top 5 most genius movies ever made! I realize it changes quite frequently, but at the time I'm writing this user-comment, Sidney Lumet's amazing debut film is #5 in the IMDb Top 250! That's a fantastic accomplishment, especially if you consider this film is more than sixty years old, doesn't feature any computer-engineered special effects and hasn't got any geeky cult followings that dress up like the lead characters. Heck, if you take out the everlasting and manipulated feud between ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Godfather"", this ""12 Angry Men"" may even be the REAL #1!

But ""12 Angry Men"" deserves all the superlatives you could possible use to describe it. Everything about this film is perfect, and if there's one film that literally everybody should be obliged to watch at least once in his/her lifetime, I think it ought to be this one. The original story by Reginal Rose is wondrously absorbing, intelligent, intense and still incredibly relevant even after 60 years. Rose's own adaptation into a movie screenplay is also amazing, with not a single word or piece of dialogue too much or too few. The ensemble cast exists of twelve hyper-professional actors that each give away one of the most impeccable performances of their careers; most notable Henry Fonda as the humane hero, Lee J. Cobb as the dogmatic narcissist and E.G. Marshall as the rigorous pundit. But the biggest geniuses remain director Sidney Lumet and his cameraman Boris Kaufman. If you think that a film that for 99% takes place in one and the same room will inevitably become boring and monotonous, just wait and look what brilliant opportunities there exist in terms of camera angles, lighting, zoom functions and sweat stains!",10

29 April 2016,A must see for any movie fan,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

15 May 2016,12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.",9
1 March 2017,Legal philosophiser to appeal to any intelligent person,"There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.

Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one.

I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system.

The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.

One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.

Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet.

In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.

I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree.

But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury.

One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. I guess for all its faults the Anglo-Saxon version of justice is the better.",10
24 May 2011,A perfect movie with interesting and mysterious story,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

28 February 2019,A classic,"A complete classic that stands the test of time. Extremely well written with giving us a group of 12 men who are in a court case and are the ones who will decide the fate of a young man who was put on trial for a murder it seems very obvious he committed, but over the course of the movie more information is uncovered showing whether he truly did it or not. Great dialogue that gives you an insight into these characters without showing you any of their backstory, fun back and forth talk between characters. You feel enclosed in the room the characters are in since the majority of the movie takes place in one small room, but it completely works, this movie is essentially perfect, high recommend.

Then there is '12 Angry Men' , with the entire film shot in a single location, and becomes the most entertaining film I have seen in a very long time. This is a film which gets the best of critics to rate it 10/10. You will just admire it's every minute.

11 February 2011,"Simple Formula, Colossal Result","I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.

To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.

If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.",10

18 March 2015,One of the Greatest of All Time - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt!,"From a distance, 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years. Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.

Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly ""the hottest day of the year"". A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.

Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors – all 12 of them – are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.

The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!",10

10 April 2013,Another Not-So-Angry Convert,"I decided to give it a few days after watching this film before writing my review, including enough time to watch several other top-rated films from this time period just to get some further perspective.

The film was simply fantastic, an absolute intellectual orgasm. Never did I dream it possible that a film over 50 years old could make me physically jump out of my chair, leaping and punching the air with glee, after the end credits rolled. I felt an enormous sense of justification in taking the time to watch this very old film.

At the beginning of the film we're presented with 12 indistinct men of no-particular defining characteristics, but by the end of the film we can clearly recall the decisions and personalities of each individual and how they arrived at their conclusions.

Except for very brief opening and ending scenes, the entire film takes place in a single room with nothing else going for it other than the script, acting and camera work. It made me refocus on what film really is; a visual story presented to us by a film-making crew and various actors, but in modern times, sometimes consisting of a much weaker script clouded by heaps of visual effects and the use of technology.

You've really got to see this film to understand why it's so good, currently rated no.6 of all-time on IMDb for a very good reason.

I'd like to delve deeper into the jury's decision, but I can't, without adding spoilers to my modest review. I'll leave it at that then. Reward your intellect by giving this master work a chance to unfold.",10

26 December 2012,"Racism, Bigotry, and Stereotypes, Oh My","I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with ""12″ (Monkeys) in the title.

Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.

The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.

But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too—this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.

It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.

I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified ""classics"" that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.",10
26 November 2021,Mindblowing!,"The movie containing dialogue after dialogue, but never seems to be boring or irrelevant. If you think about a movie without nudity, sex, glamour but only content, you must include this one in your watchlist. Nowadays, movies having no glamour, no female protagonist, no nudity is seems to be complete failure. However, after watching ""12 Angry Men"" your perception might alter.

23 December 2014,A near perfect film,"12 Angry Men may just be a perfect movie and if it isn't, then it's pretty damn close. I can't think of another film that was simply people in a room arguing for an hour and a half that captured my attention as much as this one did. If you can write a script that keeps people entertained by simply listening to what you wrote then you deserve limitless praise. Watching these men slowly examine every detail of the case they're given and watching them internally and externally debate whether or not the accused kid is guilty is some of the most riveting pieces of cinema that has ever been filmed. This very well could be in my top 10 favorite movies list and I cannot praise it enough. This film needs to be a required viewing for all film fans.

11 July 2007,A 10 star message?,"The best thing about this movie was watching the classic Hollywood and TV actors. The writing was good and is seldom found in movies today. Apart from that the film was nothing special.

After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'

Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"".

13 April 2014,Back when Dialogue Mattered...,"Nowadays, it's hard to find a screenplay that's based solely on dialogue. The mere suggestion of locking 12 men in a room, having them debate with each other and making a movie out of it in the 21st century would be unheard of - God forbid people might actually like it!

I'll be honest, that was my initial reaction upon reading a brief summary of this movie. But being a fan of classics, I knew that somehow this would work. There is no need for a visualization of the crime; there is no need for fancy props (save for a knife and a diagram), there is no need for special effects. The powerful acting and emotional dialogue in this film are enough to sell its message, and it is a meaningful message at that.

This film is a must-see, for lovers of classic films and great acting.

8 December 2021,Easily my number one film,"This film is so impactful and evocative to me. The entire journey is just so riveting and masterful. Even though it was made in the 1950s you can easily apply this film to today's society as its overall message and values it conveys to the audience, such as prejudice and how everyone will interpret a situation differently. I love the cinematography in this film especially the opening scene as the credits are rolling as it is one take and it just adds to show us the claustrophobia these men must be feeling as they are all cramped together in a small hot room for hours. The performance these actors give are impeccable and layer on top of each others to increase the tension. I easily give it a 10 as I can see no flaws in it, I recommend it to everyone to watch and I highly doubt you will not love it too.

3 May 2007,Was it really First Degree Murder?,"This is a superb drama,and every actor in it gave a great performance.I can watch it over and over without being bored by it.As entertainment it is great,and that is the main purpose of a movie.I only have one slight reservation,and that has to do with the plot.Some reviewers have pointed out that Henry Fonda did things that should not be done by jurors.But the thing that I find strangest is the charge,First Degree Murder,with a mandatory death sentence.Jurors are usually able to find an accused guilty on a lesser charge.Even assuming that the kid was guilty,the circumstances do not look like premeditated murder.Taking place in the middle of a violent argument,after being struck by a much larger and more powerful man,it looks far like manslaughter than murder one.But that is a minor quibble.This is still a great movie.

20 December 2016,100% deservingly to be on an all time top-10 list,"The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends, leaving the viewer with a bitter question : ""why aren't there movies like this anymore?"" No need for extravagant sets, no need for more than one room for the entire history of human race to unfold before our eyes. Looking inside of us, personally and as a species, we can all identify each and every one of the jurors. We all have acted indifferently, got carried away with anger, or with prejudice. We all are (or should be) capable of standing out for just causes like Henry Fonda's character. It's a question of choice, ethic and circumstance. Sidney Lumet, does an excellent job of subtle direction, delving into the very depths of human existence and civilization, keeping the highest entertainment value, succeeding where all the Bergmans and Tarkovskis have failed miserably. A triumph of American cinema, a movie that everyone must see before they die.

2 March 2006,So simple yet unbelievably effective,"12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.

The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.

The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.

It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.

Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.

12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. Faultless.",10
12 April 2006,The Greatest-ever Legal Drama and One of the Greatest Films of All Time,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness.

26 June 2020,A simple story told perfectly.,"Personal Rating: 10/10

If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?

Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets. And I feel that needs to be celebrated, acknowledged, and loved.",10
7 January 2015,Great movie,"I remember seeing 12 Angry Men about 10 years ago and really enjoyed it, but I watched it a bit closer last week, and realize what a great movie it really is. I love the movies of the 40's and 50's and I would have to say that 12 Angry Men is up there as one of the best 5 movies of that era for me. There are some many things happening in this movie, that it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up. The camera work is first class, starting off with full view of all 12 jurors, and as the movie progresses and the jurors re-asses their decisions, the camera show the jurors looking straight down the lens, giving the impression they are talking straight to the audience. No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days.

Although not a long movie, the emotional turmoil felt by the jurors is explosive and the audience are drawn into the same gut wrenching feel. I highly recommend this movie.",9
2 May 2020,12 Angry Men,"The plot unfolds well, but the part Davis advocates is only vague speculation. In fact, after proving these things one by one, the child may or may not be the murderer. It's just that the initial work of the prosecution has not been done well, the cross examination of the defense has not been done well, and the case should be investigated again, rather than simply acquitted. It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal. Because no matter whether the masses are blind followers or male masters, they are just crushed. Literary and art youth criticized me for pursuing the truth and vulgarity. So long as it is contrary to the institutional view, is it fair and just to accept the innocent result.

3 August 2022,Absolutely great,"This is one of those movies that i had to replay a second time the moment i saw it. Something about the way in which the plot flows to suggest to its viewer to watch closely, for the devil is in the apathy. Or is it?

Anyway, if you don't like long conversations spare yourself the time, but if you do, you're in for a fascinating character study. After all, this is one of cinema's gems that has stood the test of time.

15 June 2020,Exceptional even 60+ years on.,"This film to me was simply about standing up for what you believe in, even if the majority are against you. Henry Fonda's character, Davis, stands lonesome against 11 men in a battle that will determine another young mans life. As the story moves along you as the viewer are compelled to the minority's side as are the other men around Davis. I was enthralled the whole way through and believe it is still, even 63 years on, worth a watch. It is still as educational today as it was in 1957. Fantastic performances and heart wrenching dialogue, this one is a true classic.

8 March 2021,JUST ONE ROOM,"The picture captured a whole event and made the viewer care about this story about a boy while using only one location. This just shows us how well-written it is. The blocking and cinematography were impeccable, just like the acting served by Henry Fonda and others. All in all, the film made us defend a boy without even showing him properly and not physically going through any of the scenes which is mesmerising to say the least.

31 August 2003,12 Great Actors,"12 Angry Men is one of a few films that take place in, essentially, one location. Such a story requires, first of all, an intriguing Script. Second, it requires great acting...and that is exactly what it has.

Certainly one of Fonda's best, 12 Angry Men earned every single one of its Oscar Nominations.

As this film is nearing fifty years old, it is slipping away from current audiences -- which is truly unfortunate. Anyone interested in court drama cannot miss this film. Furthermore, anyone who can appreciate a witty script with real characters and excellent verbal warfare will enjoy this film.

7 April 2003,This movie is excellent build,"I must say that this movie is really well written, directed and performed.

The movie starts with evidence that looks like a clear case, but one juror is not sure. It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.

Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.

The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.

You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job.

""12 Angry Men"" is an impressive movie. I have rated 454 movies, and only 11 movies have been rated 9/10 or above, and this is one of them. I will rate it 9/10, it's one of the best of all time.",9
13 September 2020,"A lesson, an inspiration, a rule-breaker and and an absolute masterpiece.","I remained paralyzed after this movie. It offer a so vast number of lessons, that picking the best part of the film is a challenge: the proof that talent can outcome blockbuster's budgets? The proof that even a few elements are enough to build a more-than-acceptable development if handled well? The technical sides, like the stunning acting performances? The incredible number of different interpretations anyone can think about? The ability to make you mentally and physically feel like you were part of the story?

This is what someone who want to work in the cinema industry should hope to achieve. Personally, this movie changed my way of viewing cinema.

30 March 2020,An absolutely important courtroom drama that was way ahead of its time,"In spite of being recommended multiple times, I only got to watch this masterpiece during the months of quarantine in 2020 and I was really surprised. Alongside being a masterfully crafted film, the most important aspect was how this film was way ahead for its time being released in 1957.

It follows the tension between 12 jurors locked in a room who must arrive at a unanimous decision to convict an 18 year old who is accused of murdering his own father that at the first glance looks like an open and shut case. However, when one of them decides the other way, each one must face their own prejudices and moral burdens as reality is put into trial. It deals with multiple themes. most importantly the idea of democracy, racism, xenophobia and the dangers of preconceived ideas. The screenplay is sharp and the tension between the characters keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. What results is a rare courtroom drama that takes outside of the court but creates more impact than a lot of new age courtroom films.",8
1 March 2020,Not your standard thriller !,"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !

It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.

12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.

What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.

I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.

To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.

10/10",
22 April 2000,"should be titled ""one aggressive man and others""","wow, this movie really gave me that ""Shawshank Redemption"", intelligent dialogue,and not much physical moment feeling. This movie was great. It didn't need big expensive scenes or computerized takes, it was all in the talent and the moment. I do have to say that with all the high ratings I did kind of expect a surprising, slap in the face ending, but instead this movie came out as a ""Reservior Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" ending that just sort of hung there, but I suppose that's just one of its many significance that I have not yet realized. This movie contained some of the finest gathering of actings in the history of filmmaking. Even though this movie takes place mostly in one room, but the actors still were able to play the parts as if they lived it.

in summary i give this movie a 8/10.

and yet suppose I didn't see this movie.......................

19 March 2013,all it took is 1 room and 12 people to create one of the best movies I ever watched in my life,"For a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, I must say it was a blast. Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail.

What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match.

An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world).

The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were.

There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way.

Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.",9

4 September 2007,The hope of democracy,"As brilliant a presentation of the arts of logic and conversation in a situation of severe stress as one can imagine. The dialog is razor sharp, the characters well-drawn, and director Lumet, cameraman Kaufman and editor Lerner have worked miracles with a cramped space that doesn't lose any sense of claustrophobia in the process. Although one can certainly take the message as having to do with inherent problems in having a death penalty as a rule of law, there is a deeper message still: does not justice, in a democratic society, demand of us to think clearly? to uncover and expunge our individual prejudices? to confront the enormous weight of responsibility as coolly and objectively as possible? If the answers to those questions must come up negative, then democracy is a false hope and we should abandon it and give ourselves over to the nearest group of elitists who can guaranty us bread and circuses.

Right now, with a right-wing junta in power in Washington, many Americans seem satisfied with such a possible result; they seem to forget that the result would be the same under a left-wing junta as well. The hope of democracy is that government is neither left nor right, but every day, that it allows all of us some share in shaping our own destinies personally and collectively.

""12 angry men"" is thus a film filled with hope - hope for ourselves, each as individuals, but also hope for our future, our children and the possibilities they represent.

If this hope is false, it is still certainly preferable to any of the lies spewed forth by the American media today.",10

27 July 2010,About as good as it can get.,"This is minimalistic movie making at its very best. I mean as far as movies set in a single room go this is simply the best one out there. Lots of later movies tried to imitate it and attempted to reach the same level of successful and brilliance but none of them have even come close yet.

It also has one of the most simple premises out there. All that the movie is about is 12 jurors trying to decide whether or not the accused in a murder-trial is guilty of the crime or not. So the movie is all talk but sure no bore. It's a movie that is always going and at all times interesting, due to its diverse and rich characters and its simple, yet greatly intriguing concept. I have no illusions about it though that this is also how its like in real life. So even though the movie takes a realistic approach with its story, it's still obviously fiction but at least it's not overwritten or ever exaggerated.

Interesting and most effective thing about the movie is that it starts off with only one guy voting for the accused being not guilty, even though he himself is not at all convinced that he is actually innocent. He only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. All are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt. So slowly opinions start to slide and some of the jurors get set up against each other, due to their different opinions. Its what keeps the movie so interesting to watch and is also what makes the movie a real well flowing well.

It's also brilliantly brought to the screen by director Sidney Lumet, who had never directed a theatrical movie before actually. Even though the movie is set in mostly one room he uses this aspect to the maximum and to the movie its own advantage. It gives the movie a great atmosphere and feel to it. There are some long and dynamic shots, that allow all of the characters to often do their say in a sequences. It gives the characters actually some depth and personality, even though we never get to know all of their names and of course it's not being the type of movie that has the space and time to do some character building. Sidney Lumet really did the most and best with the story and its characters.

It's obviously a character drive movie and in a way also a real great character study. So it also really helps the movie that it has some truly great actors in it. I was a bit worried about Henry Fonda being what was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, also since I was used to seeing Jack Lemmon in that role, in the 1997 remake. But no, Fonda was just surprisingly great and effective in his role. Lee J. Cobb was also really great but by saying that I feel like I'm not given the rest of the cast enough credit. All are simply great in their roles, though it are Fonda and Cobb that stand out, also because they are being the main characters of the movie, that throughout stand opposite to each other with their views and opinions. It's were most of the movie its fireworks comes from.

One great and fantastically effective minimalistic and simplistic movie. Movie-making at its best and purest.

11 September 2022,Lee couldn't be better,"I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.

In essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?

One aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.

Still, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor. There was enormously stiff competition in that 1957 category, and all the nominees were truly winners.",7
9 June 2010,Stunning,"This is one of the best films I have ever had the good fortune of watching. A jury is nearly convinced that the accused is guilty. One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",10

5 May 2007,This is what the art and craft of fine film making is all about.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10

4 May 2023,"""Boy oh boy, there's always one!""","Hitchcock once said you could stage an entire film in a telephone box; and '12 Angry Men' triumphantly demonstrates the excitement that can be generated just by a bunch of guys talking around a table. (The dramatic highlight simply consists of a closeup of Juror 4's face as the penny finally drops.)

When I first saw this film at the age of 13 I knew nothing about it in advance and still vividly recall my mounting excitement when I realised that the action was going to be entirely confined to just the one room.

Although failing to win a single Oscar and dying at the boxoffice '12 Angry Men' created enough to be parodied on 'Hancock' and remained the film in which Henry Fonda took the most pride. (He later said he'd commissioned Sydney Lumet to direct this version of Reginald Rose's television play because he knew that he'd be good with actors but that his skill with the camera came as pure gain.)

Films set in courtrooms are so common it's become a genre in it's own right, but after nearly seventy years '12 Angry Men' continues to stand in magnificent isolation as the sole film confined simply to the jury.

Since I originally saw this film as a teenager I have probably seen it again about half a dozen times and each time I discover something new (it took several viewings, for example, to notice the way the other members of the cast routinely patronise the elderly juror and his often querulous response).

It's easy now to sneer that all twelve are white and male; but the film might be discreetly making the very point that the defendant - briefly seen at the very start - whose life is in their hands is obviously hispanic; one of what Juror 10 dismissively describes as 'them'.",10
3 January 2022,Brilliant,"Extremely suspenseful and gripping, this feels like the perfect ""debate/argument"" film and is definitely the most interesting movie contained in only one room that I have ever seen.

It is enthraling, it gets more captivating by the minute and the acting is superb.

8 April 2021,most impressive,"This is most impressive with director Lumet ensuring that the viewers interest is held at all times. The script is excellent with the gradual escalation of doubt adding a level of excitement to an already interesting concept. Watching the recent Egyptian film Clash the day before where a number of disparate men are trapped inside a police van for the duration makes for an interesting comparison but whilst the Lumet film appears rather theatrical by comparison a similar tactic of using close-ups helps considerably in maintaining the interest and increasing tension. The earlier film is quite a show piece for acting talent and all acquit themselves admirably whilst it was undoubtedly a marvellous launch pad for the director's career.

12 November 2015,12 angry men makes one satisfied viewer,"Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes.

The man is Henry Fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. While he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. With that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. During this time, the New York City heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses.

Fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. He is referred to as a ""golden boy,"" sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override.

One of the many intriguing things about Fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. How many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? Most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: ""maybe I missed something,"" we'd think, ""maybe I'm just way off,"" we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. If Fonda's character would've done that, 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of American cinema.

The key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. As stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda's character. Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. Film critic Mike D'Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O.J. Simpson of his murder charges. The fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. The correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for I'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence.

This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. The attributes of the film I just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. Finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (Ed Begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty).

Finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men. This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. As droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas I've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) I have ever seen.",10
31 July 2022,Character building and diversity 101,"No surprise really that it belongs to the T5 imdb rated films, its rare for most to watch black and white movies nowadays especially a 1957 production but what this movie produces in terms of character perception and individual character writing is brilliant, like something I've never seen. The longing dialogues and smart character placement and even motivations display each and every character in a different lights this could even be conveyed into todays everyday life where we all have different wants and act different under pressured.

Honestly soso well written with brilliant acting.

11 June 2021,A must see for all independent film makers.,"In a Hollywood oversaturated with Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies, the idea of a talented small group making a movie on a budget, sounds mortifying. 12 Angry Men proves not only that it can be done, but it can make one of the best films ever.

The movie begins with a judge telling 12 jurors to decide the fate of an accused boy. Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.

The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.

It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.

12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future.",9
30 August 2018,This is truly a classic.,"I'd like to see a modern movie try to stay in one room almost the whole film while keeping it practically in real time and have the same power and emotion as 12 Angry Men. This is truly a classic.

7 February 2008,Is this the perfect low budget cinema for students to learn from?,"Yes, this is a Hollywood masterpiece. It was the start of an incredible journey by the director, Sidney Lumet. It's a shame the writer Reginald Rose did not have as an illustrious career as Lumet, but he did write one other classic, MAN OF THE WEST (1958). The nod goes to the performances by an amazing cast who hold it together in the confine spaces of the one setting. You would expect a film that mostly takes place in the one room to be theatrical, but Lumet manages to create the intensity with his tight direction and the brilliant use of deep focus and wide angle lenses. This is one film that all students should watch to observe the craft of how to create a very low budget movie with a perfect cast, the right director and a top notch writer.

11 March 2014,Keeps You On the Edge Of Your Sheet!,"This film, 12 Angry Men is famous for it's use of only one interior location for the duration of a film. It's a hard challenge to make a good film in only one location, but it works for this film. It's also known for it's disappointing box office and the critical acclaim it has received. Personally, I enjoyed the film because it does a great job building tension as the film progresses and it makes you what will happen next. It doesn't need action or explosions to old your attention, it has the proper characterization to hold your attention.

Sidney Lumet's film is a courtroom drama on the outside, but on the inside it's more about a debate amongst jurors on reasonable doubt on a case about a kid who supposedly murdered his father.

This film requires great acting and that it has plenty of. With only one bankable star in Henry Fonda, the cast manages to pull this off. Each character has their own unique identity and each identity is prevalent here. Their emotions are essential to how this film leads up to it's big ending.

Overall, this is a great film and a great character study. It's a film that people in film school should be required to watch. It's all about the little things here since each of them count. We don't know anybody names, but we come to get to know these characters. It's as if we are there in person watching all this unfold. A great film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9
5 September 2016,Masterful Filmmaking,"Being a film buff myself, I'd like to think I know good movies when I see them. With 12 Angry Men, all it took was a few scenes and I knew this was one of the great ones. Not only was this movie important and influential, it's also easily re-watchable. I've seen it three times now and each time I pick up on new tidbits of information and dialogue that I missed the time before. I would imagine it's not easy directing an ensemble of 12 in one small room, but Sidney Lumet managed to do it, and do it very well.

I often find crime-drama's to be my favorite genre of movies in large part because of the suspenseful aspects of that particular storytelling. While 12 Angry Men is far from a prototypical crime drama, it's certainly suspenseful. What begins as one man's doubts against 11 other men's desire to leave the courthouse as fast as possible, ends with a powerful message of prejudices and class issues. The nice thing about this particular criminal case is that at first listen, it's hard to argue with what some of the men are saying. There's definitely a grey area to this particular case, and that proves to help the development of the suspense and third-act revelations.

Perhaps even more important than the simple theme of class issues is the idea of communication, and how far a little talking can take you. As Henry Fonda nicely put it ""we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure."" All of these men were under difficult conditions, considering the small room and blistering heat, but all of them also needed to understand that communicating with each other was the only way they were going to get through the night. I loved the way Lumet gracefully gave every one of the actor's their time to shine. Although Fonda was the clear star, and likely had the most lines, here, every single one of them brought their A-game.

The film also points out how easy it is to involve your own personal prejudices into cases like this. Perhaps even to some viewers it may be hard to against the grain of 11 other ""angry men"" and vote not guilty, but sometimes it takes more than just sitting around and waiting for someone else to step up. Sometimes you have to be the one to point out the questionable things in whatever job field or discussion you are in. Communication can be a difficult thing, but if you're willing to listen to others share their opinion, you should be willing to talk as well. But I do know one thing that can't be disputed, the greatness that is Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men.

3 September 2005,A Very Flawed classic,"When I was younger I thought 12 Angry Men was a near perfect ensemble film with a great group of male players. At that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. It was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here.

Then I served on a few juries and my concepts changed. One of the key scenes of the film is when Henry Fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. The second that Fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial.

In all 50 states of the United States of America, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. Jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. But they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather ANY independent evidence.

I remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a BMT subway stop that took me to work. And those same subways also took me to downtown Brooklyn and the court house. I made it a point to take the IRT to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene.

It was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. I can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations.

The juries I was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. They were a good cross section of the breed Brooklynus Americanus just as in 12 Angry Men. If you watch Law and Order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict.

Still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are the biggest names in the cast. But others like Robert Webber, John Fiedler, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman got their first real notice in this film.

Jack Klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. He's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence.

We should be thankful that Sidney Lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.",6
22 July 2009,A tense and absorbing classic!,"12 Angry Men is a very entertaining film. It is full of great writing, directing, cinematography, and acting! Henry Fonda proves to be a very strong leading man. His performance here is flawless as a man trying to convince 11 other jurors about the possibility of a man's innocence. Lee J. Cobb is phenomenal, as well as E.G. Marshall. The twists and turns the film goes though are very absorbing, and when the film is done, you feel like you know every one of these characters very well. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director, he captures some very nice shots, and some very long shots that are powerful. 12 Angry Men is one of those rare black-and-white films that are actually very entertaining.

11 August 2013,Twelve men and one room...,"All happens to a jury room where twelve people manage to decide if a young Spanish - American is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. All things show us that is a clear case of murder but one juror has different opinion from the others, and that's how our movie starts.

In this movie we see twelve different personalities which have their own opinions for some subjects and they have different experiences and different problems from the others.

We can also see in this movie how the circumstances change as time passes and the debate between the twelve jurors continues. We are tempted to compare this movie (12 Angry Men of 1957) with ""12 Angry Men"" of 1997. Personally I liked more the old version of this movie than the new version which I found it not as good as this one.

There's no need for any detailed analysis because in this movie everything is just perfect. I would like to see it as a theatrical play.

24 February 2002,Communications Skills,"All of the drama this movie has to offer stems from the fact that one juror could express his opinions better than any of the other jurors.

Those with poor communications skills gave the viewer a false impression that they were shallow people who formed an opinion based on reasons other than the merits of the trial.

The question that must be answered throughout the movie is: Should a juror's personal limitations in expressing himself bottle up solid evidence in deciding whether a defendant is guilty or innocent?

23 November 2019,Simplicity is class,"That's what we mean when we say simplicity is class. This is a masterpiece by a budget of a dinner for two. One room (except for the opening and the ending) and twelve actors doing twelve different personalities, and great shots of the faces expressions. Made in 1957, and it's still considered a masterpiece by 20th adults in 2019

23 July 2022,Best Script Ever Written,"This film is incredible. Every juror has a distinct personality, and the plot progresses at a comfortable pace making use of great camera angles and acting. Being filmed in black and white does not detract from the experience at all, this film still holds up today and is, in my opinion, the greatest ever made.

25 March 2016,Powerful Remake of the 1954 Television Classic,"Based on the classic 1954 television drama of the same name, TWELVE ANGRY MAN was director Sidney Lumet's first feature, after a career in television. It was also the first (and only) film that star Henry Fonda also produced, apparently he grew quite frustrated with the responsibilities associated with the role, even though he enjoyed the acting task.

Shot in only nineteen days after an intense rehearsal period, TWELVE ANGRY MEN makes effective use of the confined space of the jury- room. Lumet employs different types of shot to convey the increasing sense of tension, ranging from the close-up, the two-shot and the tracking shot as well as the basic shot/reverse shot sequence. Through such strategies we focus on the jurors' faces as well as their reactions to one another. It's clear, for example, that Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) cannot stand Juror #8 (Fonda); not only are they ideologically poles apart, but Juror #3 cannot stand what might be described as the ""bleeding heart liberalism"" that prompts Juror #8 to question whether the accused was guilty or not. Juror #3's frustration is signaled as his face becomes more and more contorted and his voice rises into a high-pitched scream as he discovers that no one appears to listen to him.

The shot/reverse shot strategy works most effectively in the confrontation between Juror #4 (E. G. Marshall) and Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), where they discuss the effect of wearing glasses. We watch Juror #4's air of self-confidence gradually evaporating from Juror #9's point of view, until Juror #4 is forced to alter his judgment.

Stylistically speaking, the film is divided into three movements. In the first, Lumet shoots most of the action from an aerial perspective; this has the effect of belittling the characters, almost as if their discussions were unnecessary in light of the verdict. In the central section the characters are shot from eye level; hence we become more and more interested in their reactions to one another. In the final act Lumet photographs them from below, with the camera looking up at the characters; as we see the ceiling of the jury-room behind them as they speak, we feel that the situation is becoming more and more claustrophobic as previously-held prejudices are broken down and the characters' true natures revealed.

The film comes to a dramatic climax - which is not in the 1954 version - as we understand why Juror #3 has been behaving in such extreme fashion. The reason has little or nothing to do with the case in hand, and everything to do with Juror #3's familial struggles. In light of his collapse, Fonda's long speeches (delivered slightly earlier on) about the importance of fairness and tolerance appear even more pertinent.

Even after nearly sixty years, TWELVE ANGRY MEN still packs a punch, not only in its analysis of the American judicial system and its emphasis on being innocent until proved guilty, but also for its stylistic brilliance, as Lumet shows just what can be done with a confined setting, a superb photographer and a brilliant art director (Boris Kaufman, Robert Markel).",9
20 October 2012,Supposing we get it wrong ?,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",8

6 August 2008,A brilliantly filmed drama exploring human nature and the basis of morality,"96 minute film with all but 3 minutes taking place in the same room: that's daring. It's hard to believe, but director Sidney Lumet finds a way to make ""12 Angry Men"" move at an attention-holding pace while being hardly dull at all. Now that's film-making. Lumet's camera techniques and the phenomenal performances from the actors he captures makes ""12 Angry Men"" a terrifically interesting court drama that is so elemental but so profound.

In the opening minutes, a 12-man jury breaks into deliberation over a case where a teenager has been charged with killing his father. If found unanimously guilty, the boy will be executed. After a preliminary vote, every man votes guilty except for one juror played by Henry Fonda, who is afraid of being too quick to reach a verdict.

The story basically paints a picture of 12 strangers. If you follow closely, you can learn a lot about these people, but the point is that you learn a lot about them and what makes them tick as they argue and reason. The first thing achieving that requires is great acting. This film is loaded with classic actors of the 40s and 50s. It's hard to really single out one performance as the best, though certainly Lee J. Cobb as Juror #3 is the most dramatic and he very much helps give the story an adrenaline boost when his character acts out.

But the most excellent aspect of this film, what pushes it above a lot of other drama, is Lumet's directing choices in what is his first feature film. Filming in one room, it can be easy to put little thought into camera angles and movement, but Lumet considers everything very carefully and no single shot in the film feels arbitrary. The camera moves with incredible purpose, zooming in at perfect speeds and picking angles that best reveal the characters. Also, his attention to the idea of the heat in the room, the impatience, the confinement, all comes across in his directing. His angles start above the actors in the beginning and thus more impersonal, but the camera lowers more and more as the film goes on. You're so interested in the story at this point that you don't even notice, but you feel it. Lumet makes you feel much like a 13th juror and you begin to form your own opinion, bouncing back and forth (that is if Lumet and writer Reginald Rose did their job right, which they do.)

The film is--and this really isn't a spoiler--without a climactic payoff for those that need a little something more or a resolution or mystery solved. You're supposed to find it satisfying in the way that it reveals a bit about who we are and how we arrive at the moral conclusions we make. You're supposed to learn so much about these characters that by the end you're shocked that you never even learned their names. The film is like a social experiment on screen and it's very realistic and yet still very interesting. It's an absolute marvel for being stationary, dialogue-heavy film. ~MMR

26 April 2008,"""Prejudice always obscures the truth.""","It seems that the message of 12 Angry Men (above) comes across as the film's only weakness. It starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room, where we spend the rest of the movie. It seems an open and shut case, and by a show of hands, there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty, and a single man who believes not that he is NOT guilty just that there is a CHANCE that he's not guilty.

The film's weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth. The problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys (and they rarely let you forget this, as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks, while the calm, endlessly likable Henry Fonda heads up the good guy side. Maybe the movie should have been called 11 Angry Men instead.

There is also a certain level of ham-handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors. The story is about how important such legal cases are, because the decision that they make in that room will change someone's life forever, and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision. But at the beginning, all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else. They're talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject, and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do.

Sidney Lumet, in his book Making Movies, gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 Angry Men, including the positioning of the camera (watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts) and his brilliant use of lighting. Late in the movie, as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside, it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don't even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on, and when they do, it's not just the room that is lighting up.

The performances themselves have not aged well, but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion, although I have to say that the film's other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re-analyze (or analyze for the first time) should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial. The jurors question for the first time, for example, the eyesight of the case's key eyewitness, who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train. I should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney, but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction, too.

At any rate, the film is a brilliant achievement, given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room. It reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials, even when the result seems completely obvious. The end of the movie is perfect, as there is only one way that it could really end (and I don't mean the jury's final decision), and yet it is not predictable. This is one of Lumet's most glowing achievements.",10
1 September 2009,Taut Legal Thriller,"12 Angry Men is one of those films with a high reputation, high in the IMDb top 250 and a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I too think its a very good film.

The premise for the film is very simply, a jury of 12 men much decide on whether an 18-year-old man is guilty of murdering his father. If they find him guilty then the defendant would be sent to the electric chair. The film is set in a small room, on one of the hottest days of the year in a New York Court. The jury at first vote that the man is guilty, all but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He believes there is enough reasonable doubt and it is up to convict them of that, looking at all the evidence, witness testimony and pretty much the whole trial. Juror #8 is a righteous man who is trying to do the right thing, give the man the fair trial he deserves. He gains allies along the way and they are sympathetic characters, but they are rivals, especially the hostile Juror #3 (Franchot Tone), who is convinced of the man's guilt.

12 Angry Men is based on a play by Reginald Rose, and it shows with excellent dialogue, a tight plot and great character development. It's writing at its best. The director Sidney Lumet, keeps the film within it play roots, keeping the film in a close, claustrophobic environment, like a real jury would be under. They are some wonderful shots and close ups, especially at the beginning when follow many different conversations in one continuous tracking shot for 5 minutes. Lumet knew how to work the camera, use the script, keep the tension going and gets the best out of his actors. This is a strong debut from a legendary director. 12 Angry Men is also great example of an actor's film. You believe in these actor's performance and all of them are on the top of their game, matching each other. Henry Fonda said this is one of his favourite films. Some of the characters are likable, some unlikeable, but all are real.

The film also raises questions about legal ethic, the American legal system, the American constitution and is international in its message to any country that has trial by jury. It shows many different sectors of American society at the time.",9

5 March 2012,A Thorough Tour-de-Force That Connects with Every Body Shot,"Magnificently efficient, powerful filmmaking that tells a tale the size of the Chrysler building from the cramped confines of a small jury deliberation room. A modern rendition of the same source material might have expanded this to cover the trial, the repercussions, the media's reaction and a happy ending for each juror, which completely misses the point. The most vivid drama of almost any court case comes from the simple, nondescript table its jurors convene around to determine their verdict; everything else is just sideshow. Via a dozen tremendous performances from his cast, first-time director Sidney Lumet produces a dazzling showcase of dense character development, precise plot expansions, expert dramatic timing and meaningful underlying conclusions. I must have seen it a dozen times now and still it holds me in rapt attention from word one.

3 October 2011,The jury system is far from perfect.,"If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system, this movie is the one. This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence. Instead of being impartial, the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case. This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system. The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial. They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury, anything can happen. This movie is great because the story is completely plausible. Jurors ready to fight each other; jurors who are angry, who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with; jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors. In short, this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence. Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, it's really an ensemble cast. Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue, ranting and raving, a really classic performance. After watching this movie, one can better understand why cases are plea bargained. It has nothing to do with ensuring justice; it's just a way to avoid having to go to trial - by jury.",10

18 January 2021,A courtroom drama without courtroom,"""12 Angry men"" is one of the best films of all times. It is a courtroom drama without a courtroom. No smart retorica from lawyers this time. We got 12 ordinary citizens, designated by chance, who have to decide between life and death. At first some are inclined to answer this question on the basis of racism (""We all know how these kind of people are"") or pure indifference (""I have tickets for the baseball game tonight. I would like to make it on time""). One man however reminds all the others of the principle according to which someone is innocent until proven quilty. Does this man get allies? Is the accused boy (who we see only in a split second at the beginning) really innocent? The central message of the film is that this really are two different and seperate questions!

""12 Angry men"" gives us superb acting and superb camerawork.

Superb acting despite the fact that the film contains only one big film star (Henry Fonda who also financed the film, ...and yes he is that one man I talked earlier about).The rest of the cast contains premier league stage actors.

Superb camerawork (Boris Kaufman) despite the fact that all the action takes place in one room. During the film the camera imperceptibly lowers her angle. While the discussion heates up the ceiling becomes visible and some sort of claustrophobic feeling gets grip on the viewer.",9

18 January 2016,12 Angry Men,"Wow. Many movies don't hold up very well. This isn't one of the movies. 12 Angry Men is about 12 angry men that sit in a court room discussing whether or not a boy should be considered guilty or not guilty. Simple right? Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case. Honestly the only thing that bugged me about the film was the unoriginal soundtrack/score. It didn't fit very well and sounded cliché.

9/10 - Amazing. Just watch it.",9
11 January 2011,no argument here: it's still a classic,"An all-star jury deliberates what seems to be a clear-cut murder charge, but each guilty verdict is swayed, one by one, by the reasonable doubt of good Samaritan Henry Fonda. The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.

13 January 2004,Should be in everybody's list of top ten movies.,"12 Angry Men is one of the movies which doesn't particularly divide audiences: virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece. What is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location, yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense, interest and topicality. Not a line is wasted, not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement.

Twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father. Eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict. The one thorn-in-their-side is Henry Fonda, who isn't totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more. Slowly but surely, he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open-and-shut case.

Sidney Lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance. The sweltering hot weather adds to the mens' frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations. Fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion, but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of Lee J. Cobb as the most aggressive and sharp-tongued of his rivals. There are superb performances also from Jack Warden as a juror who isn't especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time; John Fiedler as a softly-spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed; Martin Balsam as the self-appointed spokesman; and Robert Webber as a rather self-conscious ad executive. Indeed every juror is played to perfection, and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest. The script by Reginald Rose is pure genius. The whole story is told via talk - there's no direct action and no fancy flashbacks - yet it is enthralling from first minute to last. See 12 Angry Men. This is what film as a serious medium is all about!!!",10

27 June 2012,The jury is now in session!,"¨It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is.¨ 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. So why is this so good? Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet. This was actually Lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network). 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do. Many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by Sidney. The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men.

The film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young Spanish American is guilty or not of murdering his father. He reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death. The 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty. Everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he's guilty even before beginning to debate the issue. The first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he's guilty pointing to the clear evidence, but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) claims to have his doubts. He isn't sure the guy is innocent, but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man's life is in their hands. Once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place. The rest of the jury is played by Martin Balsam (#1), John Fiedler (#3), Lee J. Cobb (#4), E.G. Marshall (#4), Jack Klugman (#5), Edward Binns (#6), Jack Warden (#7), Joseph Sweeney (#9), Ed Begley (#10), George Voskovec (#11), and Robert Webber (#12). The debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another's arguments. The small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story.

One of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios. Many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas, but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible. As the men debate we see how all of this plays out, and Reginald Rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views. There is no mention of names (except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors), but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act. Their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other. This is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today. These characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century. Overall I believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers. It is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda who have left us with their rich legacy.

21 November 2019,Wow great film,"12 Angry Men is a terrific film. It captures your attention from start to finish. All it took was one thoughtful man to challenge the group. It is also an illustration of human nature. People bring their own experiences and feelings to a case affecing someone else. The way the men deliberate and challenge each other is what should happen in any jury, truly look at the facts and arrive and the best decision possible. The beauty of this film is we didn't need to see the murder or even scene to visualise the murder. It's brought to life in a small room. What is great is there is no big or fancy setting, just a simple jury room. This is where great performances shine true. A powerful cast and passionate performances. This is a true example of great acting.

Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

21 July 2008,Once More Around The Table,"A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, ""12 Angry Men"" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.

It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless ""supposing"" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).

""It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,"" a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.

But a lot of ""fancy"" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.

""This kid's been kicked around all his life,"" Davis says. ""He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.""

Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in ""12 Angry Men"" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.

The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding ""them"", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.

""12 Angry Men"" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.

But ""12 Angry Men"", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but ""12 Angry Men"" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.",7

22 July 2010,Just as applicable today...timeless,"Having watched this film again last evening for at least the twentieth time, it struck me how this film has so much to it that is real and important, each character reflecting an attitude of society. Racism, intolerance, rage, hatred, class distinctions, family discord. It is remarkable that each trait and character is so clearly developed and reflected on film. A newer version has been made for HBO which includes women, not sure what the jury selection criteria was in 1957 but apparently women were not considered for jury duty as often.

Henry Fonda is of course the standout as fair-minded and intellectual architect, a reflective man who sees the flaws in the judicial system and wants the case to be considered on its own merits. Jack Warden as the selfish yet humorous baseball fan irritated that he is missing his Yankee game. Robert Webber as the man in the gray flannel suit, not wanting to make waves. Ed Binns as a working man who at first needs convincing by Fonda. Ed Begley as a hateful racist who could care less whether a man is executed unjustly for a crime he didn't commit. Lee J. Cobb, as a man alienated from his own son after beating him, who takes out his rage on the accused. Jack Klugman as a man who grew up in ""slums"", as they were then called, and has compassion for those who survived it. E.G. Marshall, an analytical yet sheltered man who comes to see his own veiled prejudices have caused him to vilify the culprit.

The young boy accused of stabbing his father was supposedly seen by several eyewitnesses, but their testimony is then questioned. The entire film is twelve men in a heated and uncomfortable sequestered jury, and their thoughts and reactions to the case. This film should be watched thoroughly to appreciate it: for instance when E.G. Marshall, who seems to be a fair and intellectual man suddenly realizes that yes, the witness which may send a young man to his death may have been mistaken.

Do not miss, the remake has no such stellar performances. 10/10.",10

28 June 2003,riveting psychodrama,"The thankless job of jury duty and the confined room where a verdict is decided serves as the basis for ""12 Angry Men,"" a riveting psychodrama in which a dozen anonymous male jurors quarrel over a murder suspect's innocence (or lack of) on a hot summer day. Henry Fonda plays the only sympathetic juror, who, in a domino effect, cites evidence and speculation to not only influence the verdict, but to have the others stray from mob mentality and form their own conclusions. The way in which the film progresses, using a boy's life to springboard into issues of morality and even racial prejudice, is very clever and well-done, complemented by strong ensemble acting.

26 May 2010,"""Gambling on probabilities""","The 50s are known as the age of the big picture – the epics and the uber-budget monstrosities. But it was also the era when the Indy film came of age, and every now and then a mini-budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios. And 12 Angry Men is quite literally a small picture, taking place almost exclusively on the one set. It's unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage (as was, say, Rope) but from an earlier television edition – testament to the growing influence of TV at that time.

This is the cinematic debut of director Sidney Lumet, who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas (he also did the job on Murder on the Orient Express and Dog Day Afternoon). Already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space. We begin rather objectively, with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about. We then gradually close in, the shots becoming more personal. Crucially, the camera now often follows actors around as they move (especially the restless Ed Begley) to get that more aggravated feel to the shots. Finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again, revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument. Lumet shows his inexperience (some shots don't match up very well, and the close-ups are too close) but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction.

Such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting. Henry Fonda gives a subtle, considered performance, showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors, but about the implications of the trial, and the life that is at stake. Fonda clearly understands that Juror #8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for, but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility. Lee J. Cobb gives a performance of great power, and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture. Honourable mentions also go to George Voskovec and Martin Balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors.

12 Angry Men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work, not to mention a really neatly structured one. But is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat? It ought to be entirely believable, entirely smooth and unforced in feel, and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated. The writer's thought processes are too much on display. I'm talking, for example, about the way Juror #3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment. And while it's true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society, some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped, and the twee acting styles of Joe Sweeney and John ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" Fiedler don't help. None of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 Angry Men tumbling to the ground – don't get me wrong, this is still a mighty picture – but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones.",9

10 April 2011,"I don't know, but it's just possible that this is a great film","This little film has been one of my favourites since the first time I saw it on 3/12/72 on UK TV; back then I couldn't fault it but over the years its minor imperfections have become more noticeable to me. Repetition assists clarity...

It's an engrossing tale of 12 sweaty jurors cooped up in a hot and claustrophobic jury room trying to reach a unanimous decision on a potential murderer who's just been tried. Henry Fonda believes it's possible the guy is innocent, the other 11 initially don't. And that's all the background needed. It's marvellous watching the story unfold – more or less logically – but! The characters are really 12 Emotive Stereotypes: The 2 main well bred Thinkers just had to be the broker and the architect and not the slum dweller or the baseball fan, the 2 small businessmen just had to be the most interesting characters, not the old man or the clerk. The stagey and sporadic irrational emotional outbursts would make an agreement unlikely in the real world and yet it's carried by both the sincere and insincere at the finish. Where did Lee J. Cobb go to when everyone was theatrically getting up from their chairs and turning their backs on Ed Begley's right wing frothing? His chair was empty during this very contrived scene but not just before or after, presumably because it would have looked a little incongruous if he'd stood up too. And I concur with Fonda's glib comment that the defence lawyer couldn't have been very good!

However, it's still a classic and a film I owe a lot to: it made me realise from age 13 there's often more lurking under the surface than above, and in all probability nothing is impossible.",8

23 July 2021,A matter class look into the human condition,"Doubt is a virtue, and certainty is the shortest path to death. In a small room with scorching heat, where almost the entirety of the movie is filmed, 12 strangers who are the jury figures that will decide the fate of the accused boy no one knows about other than superficial information like his name and work. 12 angry men show 12 faces of what people can be in their interaction with major issues, and in their dealings with strangers who they barely know their name and profession. 12 people will decide the fate of a human being, is their last chance to save his life, but each of them is affected differently by what happen. For example juror #7, he never puts his views to the test, his convictions doesn't change, he doesn't even want to hear evidence that might lead him to the truth, he doesn't want to discuss major issues, nor ask questions, he doesn't care about the life of a young man, nor his death, he only wants to attend a basketball game, to come out of the room where the temperature is favorable. We also have juror #3, a good example of those people who think they are taking the right decision based on their own convictions, but they probably don't realize that their attitudes are nothing but reflection of their own experiences, background and feelings that have been buried deep inside. We also have a juror who can't judge a charge away from his class and ethnic convictions, and we have one who doesn't care to participate in the first place, because he believes they will surely come to a right decision. The film displays doubt as a virtue, and a passage towards justice, certainty on the other hand is the shortest path to oblivion.",9

30 August 2011,Perfect within it's own confines,"What can be said about Twelve Angry Men that hasn't already been said before with more eloquence. Sidney Lumet's first and arguably best feature has entered into the annals of film history and has been picked apart ad nauseum by critics, industry professionals and academics alike. Twelve men walk into a jury room eleven say guilty, the one played by Henry Fonda says not guilty; etc. etc.

There is a reason for this however; not the least of which is the films enduring timelessness made all the more impressive by its subject matter. Made during the decline of the studio system, the film was an oddity onto itself. A tiny black and white film at a time of Technicolor, a principle cast of character actors at a time of A-list credit cramming, and a director who up until then stuck to television and stage. Still Twelve Angry Men was far from conventional and in many ways ushered in a new age of cinema. It can be reasonably argued that Lumet paved the way for Robert Altman, Sydney Pollack and John Schlesinger among others to make the jump from TV to features.

Within its own confines, the movie is flawless. Most of the film takes place in a single room and most of the information pertinent to the case is told second-handedly. Despite this, the film has the tension of a modern day thriller and then some. The dialogue is so innately organic though never rambling and the characterizations are rich and detailed. The camera moves through the room effortlessly making enough cuts to keep things interesting without being distracting. Many large lugubrious epics wish they could keep things this interesting! The inspired script written by Reginald Rose is so fluid that it has been open to interpretation not all of which are good. Many argue that Fonda's Juror #8 manipulates the other jurors and is less a fleshed out character than a symbol of ivory tower intellectualism. Additionally the points he raises range from valid to a bit sketchy and he takes ""beyond reasonable doubt"" to extremes. I wouldn't put it quite in that context. I think just like everyone else in the room, Juror #8's choices are made based on his personal perspective. He feels compelled to push and push because no one else will. It's a character flaw that may not be admonished like the racial ramblings of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) but isn't legitimized by definitive answers either.

However you interpret the film, Twelve Angry Men still remains a taut emotional roller-coaster, a thoughtful introspective and a brilliant character piece. I didn't even mention the wonderfully nuanced work of Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden. It launched the career of a brilliant auteur and helped define an era in filmmaking that became the norm until the age of the blockbuster. Out of all the films of the period, this courtroom drama is with little doubt the most deserving of its reputation.

11 October 2013,One Courtroom.,"12 Jurors(played by Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Vaskovec, and Robert Webber) all deliberate after a trial involving a young man charged with murdering his elderly father. Initially, 11 of the 12 find him guilty, but the one holdout(Fonda) makes his case for further deliberation, and gradually persuades the other men to his side. But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of ""It's Possible."" to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since ""it's possible"" that it was the evil twin, or ""it's possible"" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome! Still, a compelling film that does provoke much thought and argument, and can't be so easily dismissed, though it is overpraised.",7

Now they are no longer filming, and they are unlikely to be able to. 1 room and 12 people who are just talking. What can be called more boring in the cinema than conversation? And in its simplicity, linearity and realism, there is a feeling that this is not even a film, but just a video shooting of what is happening. Magnificent cinema, the brightest example of art.

7 September 2008,Life Is In Their Hands -- Death Is On Their Minds!,"The defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young Spanish-American is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open and shut case of murder soon becomes a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other. Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room.

With a simple plot and a simple movie, simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made. From the sound of the plot, many of you might be unpersuaded, but the movie is that interesting. It's not boring as you think! It's like the action film filled with special effects for the previous generation! (I know, I shouldn't assume audiences these days love action films with special effects, but you get the point)

What's so brilliant about this film is that it's timeless and with one setting, you are pulled in the movie. The movie is also a study of human nature. It's not just ""OK, we need 12 votes to release the convict or execute him."" The dialog is also tremendous. I've never heard a set of dialog this good since, maybe, ""Pulp Fiction.""

The film is taut and, at times, suspenseful. The performances were excellent. The film is very interesting and brilliant from start to finish without a second of boredom. This is the classic you would want to watch before you die!",10

18 February 2009,"""I don't know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know""","Generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema, with theatrical potential at best, but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience. It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public. Lumet's persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making, and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 Angry Men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified.

While the legal thriller is always a precarious genre, walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience, Lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting, while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms. What makes Fonda's Juror #8's solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation. Fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party's innocence - in fact, he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer. Instead, Fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence, notions that Lumet's film toys with throughout as its Rashomon-style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society's constant yearning for information and knowledge. Taking similar notes from Hitchcock's Rear Window, the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator, but crucially, just like the jurors, the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed. Eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end, as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions.

And although Lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels, by the end, the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore, the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it. The jury's cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity, slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws, prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath. Masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination (while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth, the elderly woman witness' testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age) the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic. Indeed, the film could hardly be farther from it, as Lumet's remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding, using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera-work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers.

Perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection, carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one, but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true, and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point, making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist.

Such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect, and Lumet's uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint, with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance. No one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist Juror #8 than the time etched monolith of American honesty and decency that is Henry Fonda, and Fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors. Fonda's unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero, and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible, and his character all the more timeless. Lee J. Cobb similarly shines as the abrasive Juror #3, with Cobb's fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force, and far more resonant. Martin Balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed Juror #1, with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason, bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life.

What could have made for a plodding, overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic, bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance. 12 Angry Men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find, its reputation as one of the strongest American films of all time holding up, and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest.

29 July 2006,Magnificent,"One of the all time greatest character-driven works in the history of film making. It's even more remarkable when you realize nearly the entire story (with the exception of a prologue and epilogue each less than a minute in length) takes place in one room.

Henry Fonda, as the lone juror who stands for the acquittal of an accused murderer, is probably the best remembered performer, but his 11 co-stars turned in astonishingly powerful characterizations as well. It's a who's who of TV and film heavyweights, and no one misses a beat anywhere.

The Black & White filming style echoes the story's simple, one-act-play origin, aiming your focus on the actors and their high-intensity lines all the way through. Clever elements like an oppressively hot room and later a thunderstorm add some symbolic salt and pepper, but the actors are all commanding your attention so well that you don't even need such measures. The jurors come from all walks of life, with their own views of the world and life itself: the result is a fiery encounter with sparks everywhere. You are drawn in from the start, and each character becomes a real person.

Bigotry, broken families, ambivalence, self-focus, patriotism, loneliness, fear, confusion, apathy, pride, arrogance; these are just some of the elements explored in this microcosmic analysis of the human condition, and what makes us who we are. The court system is held up as a high, lofty principal, the integrity of which must be fought for if it is to work.

A great artistic endeavor, with one of the finest scripts ever written. Everyone should see this film.",10
25 August 2010,Twelve angry men in one fine movie,"In this, Sidney Lumet's debut feature, we're taken into the jury room as twelve jurors deliberate over the fate of a young man accused of murder. All of the evidence points to a guilty verdict but one juror is determined to explore every possibility for reasonable doubt, lest they send an innocent man to his death.

One remarkable thing about this film is that it unfolds almost completely in real time within a single room. While that might sound like a limitation, Sidney Lumet managed to keep the visuals interesting throughout, resulting in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, Reginald Rose's taut, Oscar-nominated script deserves equal credit for keeping the narrative flowing.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the cast is stellar. Henry Fonda turned in a solid performance in the lead role and all of the supporting actors gave it their all. In my mind, the standout performances came from Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley & Jack Warden. However, the group as a whole is a diverse one and each of the actors contributes a unique piece to the puzzle.

My only complaint (a minor one) is that the mechanics of the script are sometimes overly apparent, particularly in the early stages when Fonda's character supposedly has only a vague apprehension about certain pieces of evidence. Luckily, when the story unfolds it is compelling enough that I can forgive the screenwriter's dramatic license in setting up the events.

At the moment this film is rated #8 among the top 250 films on this site. I think that it definitely deserves a spot on the list but the current ranking seems somewhat generous, especially when you consider that it's above the likes of ""Casablanca"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Chinatown"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and several other highly acclaimed films. So, by all means, see this movie but don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be one of the ten best films of all time.",8

10 June 2007,"one of the simplest, but greatest movies ever made","As Steven Spielberg once quoted, ""Oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones"". And back in the days of the 1950s, a lot of the movies that came out were fairly simple. ""12 Angry Men"" is one of the simplest movies ever made. Nearly the entire film takes place in one room and the cast consists of only twelve characters. Yet, even its simplicity proves out to be effective, for it is one of the most intense, dramatic motion pictures ever created and truly a great accomplishment for Sidney Lumet and leading actor/producer Henry Fonda. Also sharing the screen with Fonda are other famous names such as John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley.

""12 Angry Men"" is also a film that becomes so powerful because of the way it develops its twelve stars. Every character has a background of some kind, many times a troubled one, as we see in real people around us. Fonda plays one of those characters that stands alone, bravely against a large opposing force and as he often states in the movie that he's not sure if what he's doing is really worth the trouble. The tension as Fonda tries to convince the eleven others to follow along with him develops to an incredible level with amazing performances by everybody and one of the best scripts ever written. It's one of the best movies ever made.",10

31 January 2017,The Other Side of a Courtroom Drama,"Most courtroom dramas tell the story of a trial, and typically most films of the genre center on the building of the cases, the trial in a courtroom, and the climactic moment the jury renders the final verdict. In ""12 Angry Men"", we see none of these aspects. We don't see the trial, we don't see the lawyers, and we don't see how the case was built. Almost the entire story is told in the confines of a jury room. The indisputable facts and the prosecution's case trickle in as the story progresses. There's a brief ""prelude"" where we see the courtroom, the judge, and a brief shot of the boy on trial for murder.

This is the world of ""12 Angry Men"". Except for a brief courtroom shot and one other codetta scene at the end, ""12 Angry Men"" spends about 90 of its 96 minutes running time inside a claustrophobic room where the fan doesn't work and it's supposed to be the hottest day of the year. Twelve men from differing backgrounds and age groups are put together to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder. Fairly quickly we learn that an older middle-age man was murdered in an apartment and his son in his late teens has been accused of the crime. Two witnesses during the trial testified it was the boy, a woman across the street and an older gentleman in an apartment just above the apartment where the crime took place.

Without giving two much away, the story begins with an initial poll taken by the jurors. Almost all of them believe the boy is guilty, except one, juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda). The trial occurred over the course of six days and all of them seem a bit worn out. In addition, each juror seems to have differing agendas which start to rear their ugly heads. Juror no. 3 (Lee J. Cob) is one of two jurors who has a personal agenda about the trial. The other is juror no. 10 (Ed Begley) who constantly talks about ""those people"" and repeatedly stands from his chair when he hears evidence which might contradict the probably guilt of the accused. Juror No. 5 (Jack Klugman) is a soft-spoken young man who grew up in the slums, like the defendant. Juror no. 7 (Jack Warden) is a sports fan who cares less about the trial and doesn't want to miss a sporting event taking place in the evening. There's a kindly and wise older gentleman, juror no. 9, who turns out to have unexpected wisdom (Joseph Sweeney). And Martin Balsam plays the foreman of the jury who can't seem to keep the group from going at each other's throats.

Juror no. 8 at first can't seem to convince anyone there's any reason to doubt the guilt of the accused. Even when he says he simply wishes to talk about the case, many of the jurors dismiss him. He then takes a chance and asks the others for a re-vote in which he abstains. If the other 11 jurors still vote guilty, he's willing to take the verdict into the court.

A brilliantly acted one-scene film about the possibly dynamic of a jury room. Many real-life juries have taken many hours, sometimes days to reach verdicts. Other verdicts have been rendered in seemingly short periods of time. Each actor ""owns"" his character and as the discussion continues, the prejudices and irrationalities of the characters gradually reveal themselves. Interestingly, we have the notion that juries should be objective in their verdicts, but ""12 Angry Men"" poses the question: do verdicts reflect personal prejudices as much or in some cases more than simply reviewing and determining objective facts?",9
21 March 2008,Courtroom Drama at It's Best,"Too much we often think that courtroom dramas are full of suspense and sometimes an overkill of information presented, but this film has stood the test of time and become the classic courtroom drama.

A man's life is on the line, and twelve men must decide his fate, send him to the chair, or set him free. They were the chosen few to serve their community, and ultimately serve the accused. A doubt of guilt can change even the most unlikely of outcomes, and that is what we see in this film. Raw emotion is let loose, as one by one, each man finds that the accused is too, human.

The jury was hung because of one man's belief that there might be some reason of not guilty. Standing by that, he tries to convince the other jurors as well. Starring Henry Fonda and directed by Sidney Lumet, this is one great film you should see. Only one word can describe this film, excellent, and that's the icing on the cake.",10
5 May 2021,Simply The Best,"Oh man how the turntables. This took ""Reasonable Doubt"" to another whole level.

Well for a cinephile this is one of absolute classic. So I wanted to check it out and see if the hype was real. Not only was I surprised that listening to 12 people in a room can be so fascinating, I also was astounded at how emotionally invested I was.

When the 12 jurors got into the room, the atmosphere was pretty friendly, and I liked the one long shot of just the 12 men talking and greeting each other. However, the moment they sat down, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time.

What was so intriguing about the movie was that, when the men tried to re-examine the evidence and testimony, there was a struggle of the men not trying to argue and get personal. This brought the point about the realism of this movie. This had to be one of the best screenplays. The dialogues and camera angles were incredibly real and hooking.

As the movie got along, I became emotional, and felt like I was the 13th person in the room listening. The reactions from the men were incredibly relatable. I understood why each of these characters would feel the way they did. This made the scenes even more interesting because I felt like I would react just like any one of these men. Also, when a new point was brought up, I both felt amazed and ridiculed, just like how these men felt.

Not only was I emotionally invested, I also was shocked at the arguments. People were firing and shouting at each other. Some of the counter arguments had me jumped up because of how good and satisfying they were. There were many ""Got 'em"" moments.

Overall, an absolute masterpiece. I got drama, thriller, suspense, and shock values just from listening to 12 angry men stuck in a room during a hot evening. No flaws. 10/10.",10
5 December 2008,Wonderful simplicity,"Twelve men sit around a table and talk for an hour and a half. There's your movie. Doesn't sound like much now does it? But 12 Angry Men turns out to be an exercise in wonderful simplicity. It is refreshing to know that in order to make a great movie you do not need a huge budget. No special effects are necessary. Wonderfully vibrant locations can be done without. In some cases all you need to make a great movie is a great story performed by great actors. And in 12 Angry Men that is what you get.

12 Angry Men presents an exceedingly simple yet undeniably powerful story. We follow the jury deliberations in the New York City trial of a young man, a boy really, who is accused of killing his father. There is a very brief introductory scene in the courtroom as the judge presents the jury with its instructions. Apart from that scene and another very brief moment outdoors at the very end the entire film takes place within the confines of the jury room. And what goes on inside that room will fascinate. What seems to be, as one juror points out immediately, an open and shut case turns out to be much more complex. We will get to know each of the twelve members of this jury, men who come to this room from all different types of backgrounds, each with his own unique perspective. Some of the twelve will end up playing a bigger role than others but each man certainly plays his part in what unfolds.

Initially eleven of the jurors vote to find the defendant guilty. There is only one holdout, Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. Fonda's character may not be convinced of the boy's innocence but he feels the defendant is at least owed a fair deliberation to determine if there could in fact be reasonable doubt. And off the movie goes, with Juror #8 seeking to convince his fellow jurors that maybe this is not such an open and shut case after all. Suffice to say it will be quite difficult to get some of those in the room to change their mind. There are dramatic twists and turns along the way and in their interactions we learn a lot about each of these twelve men who bring their own prejudices and emotions to the proceedings. A few of the jurors stand out, most notably numbers 3 and 10 who are most adamant about the boy's guilt. Played by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley respectively this pair threaten to overwhelm the proceedings at times with their explosive outbursts. The contrast between this pair's rantings and the calm, rational, reasoned arguments presented by Fonda's character are quite clear. Without a doubt Fonda is the star of the film but it is the opportunity he gets to play off of the other characters which really makes the film. Without the contributions of Cobb and Begley the whole thing would be rather mundane. And the other nine actors are not to be forgotten either. Each of the jurors is completely unique and every performer in the cast does a terrific job in breathing life into their character.

When a movie consists almost entirely of a group of men sitting around talking there are certain to be a few lulls and sure enough this film has a few. But once the deliberations really hit their stride and the arguments are flying back and forth the film never fails to fascinate. It's an incredibly simple movie. In this case simplicity works wonderfully. Great performances, from Fonda of course but from each of the other eleven actors as well, make this simple story real edge of the seat stuff. What goes on inside the confines of that jury room is truly memorable. It's a wonderful film and a wonderful look inside the American justice system, serving as a reminder that even the most seemingly open and shut case may not be so clear cut after all.",8
8 July 2010,The film boasts a series of excellent performances by young actors who would soon become household names.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

14 February 2021,Perfect script,"So perfect that the 1997 remake barely changed a thing from it, a showcase of its purity passing the test of time.

Instead of defying the technological limits, this movie focuses on the writing, with a story full of complexities and details for those that want to see them, but never going away from an entertaining and simple story from start to finish.

Other than the overuse of close-ups in a late segment and some questionable acting, besides Lee Cobb who steals the show, that includes the star Henry Fonda with a tiny over melodramatic performance, the movie is perfect.

Beautiful concept of creating this movie based on a single topic in a single room. This movie reflects the human psychology and social perspective of human life. Human behaviour and natural response to dynamic situation can clearly observed in this movie. We also saw how discussing a logical explanation of every fact can clearly change the course of action.

At the end, this movie was very engaging and i actually learned something from this movie. Recommending this to every user.

6 March 2021,One of the greatest movies ever made,"12 men in a room........talking.

25 April 2020,Masterpiece of Old times....,"The quote from Theodore Roosevelt- ""Justice consist not in being nuetral between right and wrong, but in finding out the right and upholding it, wherever found, against the wrong"" is perhaps the best as a summary of this movie. I wonder the movie was released in 1957 but still seems fresh. The matters and questions raised ask for answers in present world also. Everyone acts fabulously. 90% of the movie is shot in single rooom and still holds us beautifully till the end. A great gem in movies. Strongly Recommended.

16 January 2011,Anger among the jury results in justice,"This classic movie has an excellent cast of well-known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system. From the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.

As the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. The foreman, Martin Balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. At one point, one of the last holdouts, E.G. Marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. We see similar cutaways to Lee J. Cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument.

This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.",8
15 May 2005,"Henry, you are right, it's magnificent","There's no adjective to qualify this extraordinary all-times classic, which demonstrated that there is no need to spend heavy sum of money to make an useful film. The life of a young man likely to be innocent is an enormous responsibility for any jury in the world, and the plot goes around this issue. People in the jury do not necessarily think in the same way, some may favor what the supposed evidences showed in the process, others do not think too much and go behind the wave of the opinion of the majority, while others may be going deeper into this matter and not accepting all testimonies as good evidences. Furthermore, majority always tries to convince that minority who really analyzes each evidence and its truth. That's what we can see in ""12 Angry Men"", which was filmed in a room with the participation of only 16 actors, some of them playing outstandingly like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Martin Balsam among others. It is a paradox to note that such an excellent material only got Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best director (Sidney Lumet) and actors (Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). However, outside US the film got all the merits it deserves, as BAFTA in UK, Bodil in Denmark, Golden Bear in Berlin Festival, Blue Ribbon in Tokyo, and Silver Ribbon in Italy.",9

3 January 2021,12 sticks of dynamite in one room 8/10,"""12 Angry Men"" is a huge masterpiece by Sidney Lumet. Starring Henry Fonda and some of Hollywood's finest stars at the time. screenplay by Reginald Rose who wrote probably one of the most interesting, compelling and stunning scripts ever made. one jury tries to convince his fellow jurors to reconsider the case they were given and discuss the trial and evidence. soon enough the feud and rage among the characters starts growing. the room the jurors are in slowly starts to be filled with dynamite. shot perfectly and filmed marvelously. there was one scene in particular that impressed me: the opening scene when all the jurors walk inside the room and get to know each other. the scene is shot in a form of one shot, with a few close ups during shooting. its a well establishing shot that opens the plot of the film. the dialogue is probably the best part of the movie. so many great scenes with dramatic lines and dialogue so well written, it should have won the academy award for best screenplay. overall 12 Angry Men is a absolute masterpiece and a must watch for all film buffs. people can learn a lot about dialogue and character's interactions from this film.",8
20 February 2020,Slow-burn suspense keeps you riveted,"The writing and acting carry this tremendous offering that is still worth watching. I just watched it for the first time here in 2020. I was watching with a group of friends which included some teens, and adults in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. We were all captivated. Maybe the first five minutes I heard a few comments about boring black and white movies but that went away as soon as the initial vote was taken in the jury room. Each actor does a superb job conveying who his character is. Of course Henry Fonda's character stands out because, like the cheese, he stands alone. ;) Others may surprise you. There is no comic relief in this movie. It is hard core.

8 January 2017,"""According to the testimony, the boy looks guilty... MAYBE he is.""","12 ANGRY MEN is a courtroom drama. The power of human emotions, convincing and tense dialogues and almost perfect characterization are the biggest advantages of this film. The entire film takes place in a jury room. It is the hottest day of the year. The boy is accused for killing his own father. Jurors casually, cracking jokes, enter the hot and stuffy room. The case is crystal clear. The capital punishment is the only logical option. However, juror number 8 does not think so...

I think that the most important detail in the film is face of the defendant. The boy is distraught, desperate and scared. Viewers are confronted with the terrifying truth in the next moment. The life of a boy was placed in the hands of passionate people who are prejudiced.

The story is honest. I think the point is not to prove innocence or guilt in this movie. The theme of this film is the jury. Jurors are people. People of different profiles, personal problems and strange initiatives.

Juror number 8 (Henry Fonda) is calm and rational man who wants to examine every possible ""reasonable suspicion"" before a final decision. He is not the voice of reason. He is a man who does not want someone's death on his hands, if there is still room for a review of the evidence.

Juror number 3 (Lee J. Cobb) is probably the most complex character in this film. A businessman who hardly hides his passion and partiality. I can not describe his character as a negative. He is a man who is lost in his own drama.

Juror number 4 (E.G. Marshall) is a man full of self-confidence and arrogance. The insensitivity is visible in his character. The logic and intelligence are his advantages.

Juror number 7 (Jack Warden) is a man who does not have an opinion on this case. Baseball, heat and ventilator, that does not work, are more important than the boy's life. It is important to be part of the majority.

Juror number 9 (Joseph Sweeney) is a wise old man who has a lot of life experience and a keen sense for perception on seemingly trivial things.

Juror number 11 (George Voskovec) is careful and methodical man. He is ready to consider and accept everyone's opinion.

Juror number 12 (Robert Webber) was a young businessman who has probably formed an opinion on the case, but he is afraid to publicly express it, because his intelligence could become questionable.

Juror number 2 (John Fiedler) is an eloquent accountant, but apparently not loud enough.

Juror number 5 (Jack Klugman) comes from the same environment as the accused boy. There is a reasonable possibility that he had a similar experience in his youth. He approaches the case on an ironic way, but quickly recognized his mistake.

Juror number 1 (Martin Balsam) is an athlete, who heads the jury, although he did not realize the complexity of the situations in which they find themselves.

Juror number 6 (Edward Binns) is a house painter. He is a simple man who respects his associates. However, he has a very strong sense of justice that he wants to see in this case.

Juror number 10 (Ed Begley) is a real loudmouth who is eager to impose his views to others. This attitude awakened extremely ill intent in one man.

All the actors were up to the task. Mr. Fonda is the central figure, but all the other characters are getting their 5 minutes.

Body language, sharp dialogue and hot atmosphere are the initiators of the enormous tension in this film. I do not think that this film is a masterpiece of realism. Mr. Lumet showed emotions, prejudices and feelings through the conflict of opinions in a raw and a somewhat realistic way. Despite the scorching heat, sweating, nervousness, yelling, scheming and frustrations angry people arguing in a small room. They discuss the life of a young person.

However, I am pleased with the sincere dialogue, tense atmosphere and provocative drama.",9
7 March 2021,MASTERPIECE,"Sidney Lumet is an excellent director, whose career got a big boost with this picture, but the ""auteur"" here is clearly the author, Reginald Rose, whose superb script was inspired, in part, by his experience in a contentious jury room. Or it may be Henry Fonda, who having seen the play on TV insisted on a feature film, raised the money and chose the cast. The claustrophobia associated with stage to screen adaptations works to this film's advantage. Spectacle is offered in the two-shot, three-shot, CUs and ECUS by topnotch DP Boris Kaufman and rival John Ford's Monument Valley westerns or Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical miracles. The casting, characterizations, dialogue and pacing are perfect and this movie is as suspenseful as any ever made. Powerful themes are underscored by powerful performances. Knowing the ending spoils nothing.

Without spoiling anything, let's just say there is a lot of racial profiling and Jerry-mandering, despite no one being named Jerry (a classic Albert Hitchcock catch-22). It's my pleasure to give 12 Angry Men a 8/10 rating.

I saw this when I was in school in 2009 and i even enjoyed it then as much as I have since rewatching the movie on more than one occasion. Perfect story with insane peformances that is enough to idolise the guys, they are all so talented at why they do i truly wish I could watch it again!

Perfect movie to experience writer you're on your own or with a friend; highly recommended you gotta watch this.

28 July 2007,12 Angry Men,"One of the all time classics! The story is about 12 jury members in a room for about 90 minutes (real time) to decide the open and shut case of a young boy of 18 years killing his father. There are 11 votes confirming guilty and 1 for not-guilty. The whole movie is about how the 12 votes finally reach 11 confirming non-guilty and 1 for guilty, until the last one too gives in to an anonymous verdict that the boy is not guilty of his father's murder.

The movie was delicately presented. As audience we find that the case that was to be fought in the court-room was fought among the jurors. Each and every juror was aware of all the facts of the case and everyone was on the same page, except one  Juror no. 8 (Henry Ford). The movie explores the value of one life on looking minutely at the known events and unfolding them in better light for audience to understand and know that what seems truth often is not  if you look closely at it.

The movie is shot in a single room that is hot, humid and sweaty  and halfway through it starts raining outside. The enigma of the 12 jurors, the ding-dong dallying between guilty and not-guilty, the peeling of the case layer by layer with new discussions crossing personal experiences and relation to the case was fascinating to watch.

Henry Ford acts with such anxiousness that you are bitten by his conviction of not-guilty the moment he speaks his doubts by saying  I do not know, I am not sure. That starts the mastery roller-coaster to a finale that is hard to take the eyes off.

The Director Sidney Lumet does a fantastic job in I think (most probably) converting this stage drama into big screen canvass with eminent 12 actors. All of them have acted poignantly well in their well written characters and mannerisms. One can see their upbringings while they talk and that is marvelous.

Wonderful movie, normally I hesitate to give movies more than 8 stars, but for this I will give (Stars 8.25 out of 10)",8
18 May 2016,"Brilliant classic, believe the hype","This film starts out and you have no idea how the heck the movie-makers were going to make a full-length piece out of it. And yet they did. And how. Henry Fonda plays superbly well, as all actors, in this argumentative arm-wrestle between heart and brains, the 'heart' being the humane aspect and utter respect for others, and 'brains' being the logical, cerebral but ultimately lazy approach to problems. There is a very, very strong morality in this film, and unlike what you'd think, it is very, very subtly implied, carefully placed throughout the genes of this masterpiece, and very strongly executed. This film is pure acting where film is closest to acting on a theater stage. This film is asking philosophical questions with purpose and meaning and depth rather than fancy intellectual babbling. And it is a grande analysis of the psychology of men, on many different levels and in a plurality of examples. And never in excess, or exaggeration. Not one over-dramatic scene. Just right. Brilliant.

20 September 2014,Life is not something to be decided in five minutes. Let's talk about it.,"Life is not something to be decided in five minutes. Let's talk about it.

Well, the most important movie in terms of format and and in fact the best movie it terms of dialogue. This movie is completely unconventional in format and it's setting. 12 men discuss a case in a room, weird for a movie isn't it. How long can you sustain drama with a case, that's the point. Extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. All films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. Simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here.

There are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is I mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. But here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. Now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. That 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person. And that is what exactly happens.

Good, in every which way you consider. If you see it once, and I am sure if you watched it once, you will mostly be convinced by my argument it's the most Simply made movie that is great in all aspects.

Henry Fonda, must be appreciated a lot for producing this and giving the job of direction to Sidney Lumet as his first movie. Greatly written by Reginald Rose as a play and then for the movie. All the greatness pertaining to this movie should be credited to the mentioned three names. Thanks for everyone who was a part of this film and made it what it is today. This is one of the most important films of my life as it triggered a thought of why don't I make a movie set in a room and that's just live talk.

Oh yes, I waited for the longest time to get a Blu ray of this, and was very happy again with the quality., blu-ray just rocks and thanks for the transformation.

It's 5/5 for a movie that has stood the test of time and will be as great as ever even many years later.",10

3 August 2017,12 Angry Men,"I wonder what it must have been like for Sidney Lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut. Lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 Angry Men, a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people's actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death. First developed for a CBS Studio One anthology television series, Reginald Rose wrote 12 Angry Men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954. Lumet's version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release. With an all-star cast including Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman among others, 12 Angry Men is my personal favorite film to watch when I want to see a collection of the best acting talent. What I wouldn't give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 Angry Men. I can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film. Alas, I was born in the wrong time and instead of being able to head to the cinema and see 12 Angry Men, I'm here buying tickets for The Emoji Movie.

A desperate teenager is seen staring longingly at the men who just heard his case exiting the jury stall. He knows they will be the ones deciding his fate. The young man is on trial for the murder of his father, and if convicted, will face the death penalty. From the outside, his case looks open and shut. He had an argument with his father that was overheard by neighbors, he owned a knife which was the same weapon used to kill his father, and he had previous grievances with the law. Most of the jurors file into their sequestered room assuming they won't be in long, as the verdict seems clear. One juror, however, has doubts and refuses to cast a vote for guilty without at least discussing the case as they've been assigned to do. Begrudgingly the jurors begin to discuss the case sure that their minds won't be changed. One by one, however. further examination of the evidence and the factors involved in the case reveal the motivations each man had used to inform their decision was less based on evidence and more so on their own biases. An exploration of the human psyche and what motivates our thought processes, 12 Angry Men has more than earned its place as one of American cinema's best.

The opening credit sequence of 12 Angry Men was a divine long shot, achieved at a high-angle through a fan, that would provide a source of tension throughout the film, of each of the jurors filing into the room preparing to see to the matters of the case. After their opening vote reveals only one holdout, mob mentality takes over as a few vocal members of the majority intend on proving to Henry Fonda's juror #8 why their view on the matter is more accurate than his. In doing so, they also reveal their biases and the different factors driving their decision. Whether it's the lonely brokenness of a severed relationship or attempting to assert dominance to shield one's own powerlessness, each man is operating with far more than the facts of the case driving them. The lengths Lumet went to conceal the names of the jurors was one of the best decisions he made to drive home the universality of the film's message. At one point, a court worker asks one of the jurors his name and he points to it on the clip board held by the court worker. In a typical situation, one would have just said their name out loud, but Lumet's stroke of brilliance avoided names being used through the entire runtime of the film allowing audiences the chance to see themselves in the characters depicted on screen. Whether we are aware or not, and whether we act on them or not, we are all driven by personal biases. We learn the set of biases that drive us as we mature, first from our immediate familial surroundings, then from the people we surround ourselves with and the circumstances we endure. If those biases are negative, it is our responsibility to analyze them and see that we eradicate them. As a character study, 12 Angry Men is top- notch with no small thanks owed to the exceptional cast. Every single name on the credits list is that of a well-established actor of the time. Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and Henry Fonda are only half the cast and each known by an extensive body of work. One exceptional aspect, which also points to Lumet's directorial prowess he possessed even from his feature film debut is how improbable it is that this film would be such a success. One-setting films with small casts and rich in dialogue are not the easiest films to pull off, yet you'd be hard- pressed to find someone who won't give accolades to 12 Angry Men. Not once through the runtime is the film static nor does it lose the engagement of the audience. Lumet ends the film in a sensational way, as well. When Fonda helps Cobb with his coat after the two were the fiercest of adversaries during deliberations, Lumet communicated to the audience that we are all capable of seeing past what initially drives our motives and can possibly overcome them and come together on the other side. Then, just before the film ends, we learn Fonda's name and see he and another juror uncomfortably stand on the courthouse steps not knowing what to say to one another. Despite having gone through an emotional afternoon together, they don't know each other and don't have much to say to one another.",10
15 December 2012,Very good,"The only thing you could blame 12 Angry Men for is its predictability with this scheme that repeats itself until the final outcome, offering no surprises. The rest is top-notch and we are certainly in front of one of the best, if not THE best closed-door feature ever made, a very difficult genre as it happens.

The script relies on very well written dialogues, powerful, striking, captivating throughout the movie, and well developed characters that each have their own psychology. It is played by convincing actors, Henry Fonda on top of the list.

One can easily appreciate the difficult task that falls to the members of the jury and the ease with which an error is possible, even though some demonstrations are a bit far-fetched.

As for the direction, it is very good considering the limited possibilities offered by the set. The shots are intense and emphasize perfectly the oppressive atmosphere and the important choice the jury has to make.",8
12 January 2017,A study on justice in the form of art,"""Twelve men and a secret"" tell the story of 12 men who compose a jury that has to judge a murder committed by a young Latin where all evidence points to his guilt. But for some reason, one of the jurors disagrees, there begins a battle of ideologies, bad wishes, ideas, world views and even about our lives. This film contains one of the best scripts I've seen in the movies, it's intelligent, comprehensive. He invites the viewer to pull a chair and sit there at the table and enter the speech. Its an hour and a half is accurate, because the film surprisingly absurdly with its simplicity, with 90% of the film being passed in a room, the home photograph seems simple, but the camera angles, are accurate, for each jury we have a Angle, for each jury we have a story, and incredibly, we understand all men, their ideas and motivation, the character development in this film is incredible, and the room looks menacing, with the mood of the discursion getting warmer, the room too And you, at home, turn on the fan, because you will sweat along with our jurors, with great performances and a soundtrack that appears at the moment that has to appear, ""Twelve men and a secret"" this 50 years to Ahead of your time, bringing you the discourses we see today, congratulations to screenwriter Reginald Rose. Finally, I even looked, but I did not find a fault if you want in this movie, with a frightening simplicity and an absurd intelligence, we have here a legitimate representation about justice, ideology, prejudice, but everything in an intelligent way and without taking sides or choosing A political side.",10
5 June 2020,Brightest example of that PLOT is the most important thing of a movie,"Hands down to the most well written movie I've ever seen. This movie is the brightest example of that the plot is the MOST important thing of a movie.the acting was superb.you can feel the tense atmosphere of the movie perfectly. And the anti racism message presented through the movie is really mind blowing considering its a 1957 movie.also they paid great attention towards the slightest of slightest details.i think it was amazing A 10/10 for me.

3 August 2019,Movie Review Profits,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
28 September 2015,One of the most engaging and tense movies out there,"This debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. After I watched it once, I wanted to watch it again.

A boy is accused of murdering his father. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. Only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so.

I personally found this to be extremely amazing. The movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. It was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. Also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. In my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character.

Speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. As I said, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. However, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. Jurors #8 (Henry Fonda) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. I don't think that they could've given a much better performance.

Also, I found the movie to be very easy to follow. It gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. Also, the movie was very well-written. The fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie.

I can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. It is one of the most engaging and tense movies I've ever seen. The tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. The tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. I just watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. So far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. I'll just wait and see.",9
13 October 2012,"Nice courtroom drama, a classic","This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.

Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.

This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.

The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.

Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.

As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.

The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.

'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.

12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.

The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.

5 December 2015,A masterpiece of debate,"12 Angry Men, a classic movie that is truly one that can be enjoyed by anyone no matter what genre of film you might prefer. The film is one of thrills but done in a way where it is all in the dialogue and the body language of the 12 men set up to decide the fate of a young man who is on trial for the murder of his father. The movie also explores the 12 men's lives and also any prejudices they hold against the young man on trial, different perspectives are had throughout the movie not just on the murder itself but also on the man's back story as a child and how his father brought him up. A masterpiece simply in the way that it entices the viewer so that your focus is never lost and draws you in as you explore the case in one room with one table and 12 chairs.

It can't be easy to create something so astounding from 90 odd minutes of people sat in a room talking, but this achieves it and achieves it pretty fast too, it doesn't take long before you're drawn in yourself and want to know more. Sidney Lumet directs and does a fine job, he is the person really responsible for making this feel so damn well exciting I guess and combined with Reginald Rose's story and script it makes it so much more of a classic. Lumet gets the very best out of his actors and really pulls the strings, even little things like when the men move around the room; it makes what they are saying that little bit better.

Henry Fonda as juror number 8 really leads the cast, after all his character is the one who at first wants to talk about the case and debate it when everyone else thinks the kid should fry. Fonda is absolutely brilliant in his role; his calm demeanour mixed with his impassioned speeches on the case make his character one of the true good guys of cinema. Lee J. Cobb's character stands out a lot because of his overall anger at the boy involved in the case, Juror number 3 who Cobb plays is one of the stand outs because of his behaviour during the debating being done. Each juror is different, from the angry to the very meek, the guy who wants to get out of the place for a baseball game to the guy who grew up in a slum just like the young man on trial did. They each bring not only different personalities but back stories too with some loud mouths and some quiet and really indifferent to the case and that together is another reason why this is flawless cinema.

12 Angry Men deserves its place in the classics of cinema, not just for its acting or its directing etc but mostly because it's a story that all can enjoy and I think most who watch this can say they at least wanted to see how it ends. As said before it cannot be easy to create something like this, all in the same room and not make the audience bored by it all, but it has enough great things in it to make it more than just a good or great film, it's pretty much perfect. Another thing that this film does which is fantastic is you start to visualize the case at hand, I mean sure you listen to the jurors talk but sometimes it makes you start imagining all the things going on that the case entails, from the murder, the train and to the old man's story, the film never fails to bring new things up and shake the case about a little.",10
15 March 1999,A couple of problems but still very good,"First of all, I have a couple of problems with this movie which keeps this from being a classic for me. First of all, I recognize that this is a different time than now, but I find it hard to believe that a defense lawyer would allow such obviously prejudiced jurors like the ones played by Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb onto the jury. Even if he was just the public defender, it seems to me he'd have some sense. Also, again even though this was a different time, I read an article by Alan Dershowitz who points out there's no way Henry Fonda would have been able to bring a knife into the deliberation room. Nevertheless, this is still a good film, because it really explores what reasonable doubt truly means, and it showcases some excellent acting. Sidney Lumet also does a good job directing his first film.

1 August 2013,"Selfishness, laziness, and personal bias","Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.

The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names.

As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time.

12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see.

Rating: 9/10

Grade: A",
6 August 2006,A tale of America,"A wonderful and biting tale of average America. 12 angry men is a story about 12 jurors in post trial deliberations regarding the fate of a young ethnic man for the murder of his father. As the story unfolds, we get to see how each juror decides guilt or innocence in a true testament to the intellectual diversity of 50s America, and indeed present day America. I can give current names to each juror from people I know personally. Made prior to Bill of Rights reforms and Miranda rights, the way people make decisions on guilt of innocence is timeless. Stereotypes, ethnic hatred, past fraternal experiences transferred onto the defendant all masterfully depict human frailties. In the end one lone voice of reason tries to Socratic-ally make the jurors look within themselves to identify the flaws in their decision making process. Innocent until proved guilty, the human condition, society in general is on trial here. This movie has a place in everyone's collection. This is real life.

14 November 2021,One of the best scripts of all time,"It's amazing the power of this script, it manages to keep us entertained for an hour and a half showing just one room with the same twelve characters the entire movie; having to resort to other technical artifacts several times to be able to supply the small place and not leave the film exhausting, which he manages to do with mastery. On top of that we have a lot of great performances like Henry Fonda. The film manages to debate current situations even though the film is from sixty years ago, such as the issue of prejudice. For me this film is a 10 with the highlight of the script that for me is one of the best of all times.

12 April 2020,Brilliant! Teaches you Life?!,"Even though more than 97% of movie is filmed in a room not even for a second, you lose interest in the movie. Brilliant. Life of a child depends on the verdict of these 12 persons each having different aspect of life and in doing so it teaches us about life too. We see and interact with these people daily in our lives( with their different personalities) and how they affect us, good or bad? What we think of any situation in our first view, not making decisions hastily and that is the other beautiful thing of this movie! How these 12 angry men with different personalities interact and decide the verdict. Must watch this brilliant piece of work.

4 June 2008,A movie for those with a taste for GOOD movies,"I have seen this movie a few times throughout the years and have always liked it.

However, a lot of people bash it for stupid reasons.

In high school, our 10th grade English class had to watch this. However, everyone immediately booed the movie for being ""too boring"" or ""too old"".

And I read one ""Hated It"" comment here on IMDb. By user Jonathan Kwok. He claims this movie was bad because it was in black and white....and thats all. No supporting evidence, no in-depth details, no anything.

It's safe to say that movies like 12 Angry Men are becoming more and more rare in favor of modern, dumbed down movies for our modern non-thinking public. And comments such as that are proof.

The movie took something so basic as reaching a verdict and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece.

Anyway, onto the film itself. There was not much music evident with 12 Angry Men, but thats what made it so suspenseful.

Performance-wise, there are 12 excellent performances. Particularly Henry Fonda as Juror #8, the only one to stand up for his argument against all the others. Joseph Sweeney was also excellent as Juror #9, the observant, elderly juror who soon stands up for Juror #8. I personally also enjoyed John Fiedler as the meek, more quiet Juror #2; Jack Warden as the witty, smart-mouth Juror #7; and Jack Klugman as the slum-raised Juror #5.

I really liked this movie, regardless of when it was made. That should not be a factor when viewing a movie.

This is definitely a classic. Those with tastes for good films should check this one out. It's well worth it and much deserving of its place at #12 on the top 250 (as of 6/4/08).

8 March 2011,The best film I have ever seen in all my years going to the movies.,"There are simply not enough positive words in the English Dictionary to describe how superbly brilliant this film is.

Suffice to say it is my all time number 1 favourite film. It is also in my view, Henry Fonda's best role.

I think what I liked more than anything else in this film, is Henry Fonda sticking his neck out from the crowd, standing for what is right and what is just, against the ridicule of others.

Directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, and produced by Henry Fonda himself, this is a masterpiece of cinema and acting.

Any half decent bloke watching Fonda play his part, will likely as not relate to Fonda 100 per cent.

If you only ever get the chance to watch one more movie your whole life, watch 12 Angry Men starring Henry Fonda, made in 1957.",10
31 January 2016,More than just cinema,"I kind of feel like i'm in no position to judge this film, because that is what a review is after all, judgment. The reason i feel unworthy of reviewing this picture is because it is one of the best films ever made and i can not say that about too many films. This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience. This is one picture that deserves it's place in the books of cinema history and in my opinion, a great 1957 masterpiece.

21 April 2013,There is no reasonable doubt why it tops everybody's must see lists!,"""It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."" ... and so goes our juror room drama. The script is as boxed in as our jurors are creating a tense cin-experience that doesn't waste words or time. An idealism of American justice is countered by a mob mentality in this war of words. The quality acting aptly balances out the democratic message as each juror listens past their own snap judgements. A score more suitable for a sci-fi B movie can't derail the sharp 12 Angry Men drama. While many courtroom dramas are memorable, it is the back room drama that feels much more personable. I find myself trying to identify which each and every juror as they are quite developed in their annoying, corny, obnoxious and gentlemanly ways. Reminds me of that Jerry Garcia quote, ""the truth is something that happens when you are on your way going somewhere else.""

13 December 2003,Why I love old movies...,"In the days before cgi, massive hype, star-appeal, pseudo-mythic trilogies and all the other bumpf that hollywood tacks on to its product in order to make it sell, all it took to make a decent movie was to have a good script and cast, good direction and of course great acting.

These were (and still are) the only real ingredients which I'd say are essential for making a truly worthwhile movie. Everything else is just a sideshow, and I think it is a shame that so many of today's mainstream films are so flimsy. And that's why I love the classics!

18 January 2014,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable And Powerful Classic From Sidney Lumet.","12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable Classic from Sidney Lumet that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 Angry Men one of my favorite films,Sidney Lumet at his best and cinema at it's best.

Set in New York City,12 Angry Men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who's been accused of murdering his Father. While the 11 other jurors think the boy's guilty and the case is open and shut,one juror,juror#8(Henry Fonda)Isn't so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror#3(Lee J. Cobb)verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty.

12 Angry Men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director Sidney Lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. What separates 12 Angry Men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other Courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom,12 Angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room. Right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights,explosions,fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time. When you watch 12 Angry Men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that. 12 Angry Men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it's about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well-developed and interesting. The film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant. Another thing I love about 12 Angry Men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere. Boris Kaufman's black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie's intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark. I also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 Angry Men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out. Also,the fact that 12 Angry Men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat. When you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen. All the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number#8 and #3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film. Juror #8 Isn't convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case. You will root and relate to juror#8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops. Where as juror#8 thinks the boy Isn't guilty,juror#3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror #3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case. Juror#8 and #3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose is terrific,with Rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers. The ending of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non-stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget. A powerful and outstanding conclusion.

The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Henry Fonda is excellent and at his best as Juror#8,with Fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as Juror#3,with Cobb bringing intensity,anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with Fonda. E.G Marshall is terrific as Juror#4,an intelligent stockbroker. Joseph Sweeney is wonderful as Juror#9,an observant and elderly juror. Ed Begley is riveting as Juror#10,a man full of racism,hate and prejudice. Jack Warden is outstanding as Juror#7,with Warden bringing humor to the film. Jack Klugman is fantastic as Juror#12,a man with a slum background. George Voskovic is sensational as Juror#11,a European Juror. John Fiedler(Juror#2),Martin Balsam(Juror#1,The Foreman),Robert Webber(Juror#12)and Edward Binns(Juror#6)give great performances as well.

The direction by Sidney Lumet is amazing and stylish,with Lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style. Terrific direction,Lumet.

The score Kenyon Hopkins is great,memorable and intense and matches the film's tone. Amazing score,Hopkins.

In final word,if you love Sidney Lumet,Henry Fonda,Courtroom Dramas or cinema,I highly suggest you see 12 Angry Men,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10
3 April 2022,Classic,"Excellent classic movie, I absolutely love how each character is unique and the journey that it goes through just sifting through each piece of evidence and finding reasonable doubt, it's exhilarating and just a master class in how to make unique characters.

3 December 2021,Hall of fame,"12 Angry Men is a hall-of-fame film. Its greatest strength is its renowned script. 12 Angry Men is the quintessential bottle film and still influential today. Because the plot is so contained, it is completely driven by sharp dialogue and precise character development. Meanwhile, small blocking choices (like someone standing up or taking a step) are magnified by the confined location. This might sound off-putting to some viewers, but 12 Angry Men is a masterclass in storytelling. Add in some of the best actors of that era (Fonda, Cobb, and Balsam) and we have a perfect storm. Almost no movie has done more with less.

Furthermore, 12 Angry Men is fundamental filmmaking. The intentional camera framing and movements deepen the production by subtly suggesting internal character struggles. The expert editing uses minimal cuts to build intimacy and increase potency. The limited music creates a realistic atmosphere. Lastly, the direction is excellent because every aspect is unified to construct an iconic experience. The delicate tone is consistent, the style is concretely mannered, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All in all, 12 Angry Men is a must see for every cinephile and anyone interested in skillful entertainment.

Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Acting: 10/10 Editing: 10/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 9/10 Production Design: 9/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 7/10

Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that.

6 October 2012,"One of the best ""old films""","I found this film to be very compelling. There isn't any action, any special effects, any journey and anything beyond 12 men in a room arguing and it is great. The acting was perfect and the main theme was very interesting.

Anyway, this is a film that has some serious gray matter: The individual has by right that he/she is always innocent unless proved guilty and the film debates this question. Also, there is the question of bias affecting judgment of the jury relating to the social class of the individual under judgment.

Highly recommended film, one of the best of old-school cinema (which I am not particularly fond of).

16 December 2002,Polite,"Free of special effects and with hardly any sets, the movie takes place mostly in one room, ""12 Angry Men"" grabs and holds your attention throughout. The acting is first class and the story is compelling. I was taken by the civility of the group. The few loud mouths were berated for their poor behavior. It was refreshing to see especially when compared to the lack of any manners or social conscience of the cast of modern movies. Today's heros are selfish mean-spirited thugs who have no redeeming qualities besides getting the money or the whorey babe at the end of the movie. The quality called ""an edge"" in so many characters in modern movies is a result of the writing of Hollywood hacks who don't know any better. I believe it reflects the values of the Hollywood culture and it is no wonder independent movies are popular. See ""12 Angry Men"". The movie is well worth seeing.

21 April 2020,Dialogs.,"Nowadays films with a lot of action, crashes, explosions are very popular. I like them too, but not only action is the secret of good film. This film hasn't got any action, the story happens in one room, but film is one the greatest ever. Firstly, the story is quite simple, but the way of telling is caught you, you follow the thoughts of each jury and wait the finish. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors did the great performance of theor characters. So, it's one the greatest psychological fi ever.

14 February 2006,Now I have a reasonable doubt!,"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too! Last but not least the run-time of the is about 90 minutes so after getting engaged in 90 minute of fighting arguments you feel like you have watched a game where the winner is humanity of course!",
7 January 2007,Claustrophobic but compelling story of jury conflict after murder trial...,"TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.

Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).

Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.

Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.

The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.

Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors. Gripping stuff, well worth watching.",7

9 March 2020,Brilliant debate involving 12 jury members - A call for an eye for detail,"12 jury members have been assigned to a case. Interesting and well thought through series of events come to light during the argument for 'guilty' or 'not guilty'. All actors have been chosen well and portrait distinguishable characters which are a joy to watch interacting.

A major point I dislike is that we rely on jury members bringing up new points about the case, since we did not hear the trial at all.

Still a classic and entertaining b/w movie which calls for paying attention to detail and having a precise look on the human mind.

9 June 2009,Proof that simplicity is enough to win,"No funny characters. No complex story. No huge cast. Just about average acting. Keep the story tight, not too complex. And stick to it and don't deviate. End result? Grand Success. Thats what this movie tells us. The story could be about anything. It doesn't have to based on a real-life or an inspiring story.

12 Men talk about a same thing which will decide a young man's fate. How simpler could you put a story in a single line? Whats so breathtaking or even attention-drawing about this storyline? Really nothing.

But as they talk, we are amazed to see how people could take different views over a same thing. Its also amazing to see, as a movie, the strength relies on the story and how it is told and not on characters,photography etc! The acting is just so cool and everybody gets a good share.

Almost ninety percent of the movie happens inside a room where these dozen men do nothing but talk. Perfect drama-thriller with no nuisance characters or scenes.",10
25 November 2011,A must-see of simple filmmaking,"12 Angry Men-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sidney Lumet. Written by: Reginald Rose (from his own teleplay), Starring: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber.

Sidney Lumet's first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Twelve men debate the fate of a Puerto Rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father. Eleven jurors think he is guilty and one (Fonda) thinks he is innocent.

The amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial. The two do not way each other out however. Lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of Fonda's character. Reginald Rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing Lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film's relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play.

Lumet's career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful, but this is certainly not mediocre in any way. It makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this. This also serves as one of the many high points in the career of Henry Fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as E.G Marshall, Ed Begley, and Jack Warden. The impact this film had on Lumet and Hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play.",10

13 November 2007,12 Angry Men Cliché Ridden **1/2,"The film may be described as a good one due to the outstanding ensemble cast of actors in it.

I found that the film is definitely liberal-slanted. Conservatives are depicted as bigoted idiots. Henry Fonda, the juror who swayed all eventually, has a liberal, creative mind. He is really able to come up with creative ideas that leads to the acquittal of the defendant. Fonda is the dream juror for every defense attorney, as well as a nightmare for prosecuting attorneys.

Lee J. Cobb steals the film with an outstanding performance as a hateful juror who allows his personal problems with an alienated son to feel that the accused is guilty. Ditto for Jack Warden, who really switched his vote in order to get to that baseball game.

When viewing E.G. Marshall's performance, I could not help think back about his acting in the television series-""The Defenders."" He is really the opposite here

Ed Begley really spews out bigoted ideas that most of ""these people"" aren't any good and think nothing of a life. We are constantly reminded about the downtrodden, the abused child, slum and poverty living in relation to crime and other factors. The film is really a good psychological-sociological drama if anything.

It seems as though the violent thunderstorm signaled a break in the action. When the lights were put on, the fan worked. Why didn't someone in the court tell the jurors about the fan and the light? Especially, as it was a sweltering day.

As the jury foreman, Martin Balsam is supposed to conduct the agenda in order. Instead, he really allows the other jurors to dominate.

Wouldn't you love to see the reaction in court when the verdict was read? How did the accuse react? The judge? The courtroom spectators?",7

23 April 2011,Filmed entirely in one room,"One little-mentioned aspect of this great motion picture is that it was filmed almost entirely inside a jury room. Just consider that: in an era when movies have to rely on cars chases, explosions, CGI special effects and 3D technology, here's an absolutely riveting movie that was filmed entirely within the confines of a single room! That just goes to show what can be achieved with a great script, a great cast and a great director.

Although Henry Fonda is the only real ""movie star"" in the cast, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley were both distinguished stage and film actors. Most of the other actors in Twelve Angry Men enjoyed long careers on stage, screen and television, mainly as character and supporting actors.

Actors performed great specially Henry Fonda. I believe that everyone should watch this amazing movie. In my opinion it's not just a movie, in fact it's a classroom to learn how not to judge others simply. I admire the director too. Before I started watching the movie I thought it is a dull story, but after finishing this unique movie I found out to make a wonderful movie you don't need many locations or heavy visual effects, you just need a camera and some good actors.

Aside from a brief seen in the beginning of the film, the entire story is told inside the jury room itself. Henry Fonda has often referred to this effort as his favorite and I could not agree more. I've seen 12 Angry Men many times since 1957 when it was first released. It is in black and white which seems to fit the film perfectly. Note the great use of close-ups used by Sidney Lumet. It is truly a classic and I strongly recommend it.

8 October 2021,Surprisingly very good,"I am not one who relies on action, and movies to be thrilling all the way through, but this sounded pretty boring first reading about it, just people talking for 90 minutes, in one room, just talking. But it's very well done and very interesting, a great story. Full of good thoughts and ideas. The movie was very good and definitely recommend a watch.

7 May 2012,A Pure Epic!!!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
26 April 2014,A groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema,"Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is one of the very few historic features to uphold its high reputation when watching it today and really is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. The story of the eponymous dozen of more or less agitated men, jurymen to be precise, gaining more and more insight into a seemingly certain murder verdict is one of, if not the best character study ever put on film and pulls off the sheerly unfeasible feat of gripping its audience over a time of an hour and a half with the setting never changing once.

The means by which this is achieved are a trailblazing storytelling style and twelve superb actors, each of them getting multiple chances to prove their talent by a brilliantly conceived script. The cast, including names such as Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman, or Lee J. Cobb, has an absorbing quality to their acting, easily making one forget that the film is nothing but a couple of lads bantering for the entire running time. It's almost funny, how such a simple story can lead to such exquisite writing, as Reginald Rose equips the twelve angry men with a realistic past, relatable character traits, and pieces of dialogue fitting perfectly to those criteria.

Due to the lack of things to be gained when rewatching the film, it's not one of my all-time favourites, but 12 Angry Men is indubitably a classic and highly inspiring picture – regardless of your wanting to pursue a career as a director, actor, or screenwriter.",
10 January 2007,The nature of prejudice,"12 Angry Men is excellent! Its probably the best film in the careers of all concerned. Yes, its better than Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, just as good as Fonda's Ox-Bow Incident, and almost equals Lee J. Cobb's The Man who Loved Cat Dancing (just kidding about Cobb!!!). This is NOT a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. We have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. The humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a Hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. The vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. Juror #8, Henry Fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. For the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case.

In his Western classic The Ox-Bow Incident, Fonda is a bad man who over the duration of the night learns to shed his prejudice. The audiences knows he is wrong and feels relief when he makes the right choice in the end. What is interesting when comparing 12 Angry Men to Ox-Bow is how roles are reversed. Fonda is the only truly good and decent man in the jury and does not have a prejudices to shed. In fact, I as an audience member made the journey from someone convinced that the teen was guilty - based on the overwhelming evidence against him and my own hidden biases - to a person who realizes he has pigeon-holed someone into a mold which may not be accurate. The way this taut drama engrosses the viewer while raising awareness on important social issues is nowhere more evident than in the final scene at the steps of the courthouse where you really feel revitalizes after having spent a few hours in a small claustrophobic room. One of the best examples of films that can truly be said to elevate cinema to an art form, 12 Angry Men is unmissable!",10
30 June 2021,Amazing film,"Some of the best acting I have seen. Every juror has a presence in this film. The dialogue in this film is incredible. It keeps you're attention and never feels boring.

14 November 2001,Table chair action.,"It must be a good story when 12 men in a simple room with only a flip board for props can keep you engrossed for the entire lenght of the movie. By the end of the film I felt I knew the 'black kid' and half his neighbourhood - good story very well told.

2 September 2008,Arguably the great courtroom drama of all time,"For me, it's between ""A Few Good Men"" and this for the best courtroom drama, but most likely this is it. This is not the type of film I would typically expect to even be interesting. Nearly all of the film takes place inside a single room, as one lone juror (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the other eleven that the accused party is not guilty of murder. The film is composed of nothing but dialogue, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Few films can rely this much on dialogue to keep its viewers interested the entire time. Like all great courtroom dramas, ""12 Angry Men"" is an intense film, not because it is action-packed but because we must watch twelve men make up their minds and weigh all of the evidence. It is intriguing what each of these men come to realize as they ponder for hours upon end. Not a bit boring. I can watch this film multiple times and still be fascinated by it each time. The acting is some of the most superb I have ever seen, causing the audience to feel the tension going on in the room in each scene. An absolutely perfect movie.

**** out of ****",10
5 June 2017,Definitely Deserves the Praise,"This film is nothing short of perfection. I don't want to do a huge review so I'll sum up why it's so brilliant.

Great actors Great believable script Very original concept Shot cleverly (lack of close ups unless it's really necessary. Because the effect isn't used much, it is more effective) No complaints or plot holes of any kind.

I encourage anyone to watch this film!

19 September 2013,A masterpiece of acting and filmmaking.,"Brilliant film version of the televised play, scripted by the plays' author Reginald Rose, and produced by Rose and leading actor Henry Fonda. It's fascinating and compelling, offering memorable showcases to an amazing ensemble. The basic story is solid, but more than that, it's a nice look into a rich variety of characters, each with their own background and reasoning. It's all the more impressive for being a young Sidney Lumets' filmmaking debut; he makes this a highly charged, atmospheric experience.

An 18 year old teenager is on trial for murder, and the jury has retired to discuss the case. When things start out, 11 men are ready to convict the boy, and there's one holdout, juror no. eight (Fonda); Fonda doesn't necessarily believe the boy is innocent, but he's passionate in his belief that there's enough *reasonable doubt* in the matter to refrain from voting guilty. He encounters a fair amount of hostility at first, particularly from the excitable juror no. three (Lee J. Cobb), but as the night falls and a storm starts up, he wears down his fellow men a bit at a time, insisting on bringing up facts that he felt weren't adequately explained during the trail.

What's so wonderful about ""12 Angry Men"" is how believable it all is, right down to one juror, the baseball loving juror no. seven (Jack Warden) being willing to change his vote just to get the hell out of there, and the earnest juror no. 11 (George Voskovec) admonishing him for not doing this for the *right* reason. Each actor gets their own chance in the spotlight, and they're all superb. Cobb has the most intense role as a truly stubborn man who's gotten himself personally involved in the case; Ed Begley is equally potent as juror no. 10, another holdout. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, and Robert Webber fill out the rest of this powerhouse cast.

While the story is quite good dramatically, it's not without some humour, some of it coming from adman Webber. Use of music is sparing, which only adds a sense of realism to the proceedings. One of the most striking moments is when most of the group turns their backs to Begley after he launches into a rather disconcerting rant.

Overall, this does deserve to be considered one of the finest American films of all time. It keeps the viewer riveted every step of the way.

4 December 2019,Thought-Provoking and Moral,"12 Angry Men was a movie that I went into with really no expectations. But it really was a very enjoyable experience!

I personally liked how it took it's time with the story. Each actor was believable in their opinions and how they wavered between guilty or not guilty.

I highly suggest watching this old gem. I think you'll enjoy it.

25 May 2012,Fonda casts a contagious shadow of a doubt,"One room, twelve men and talk, talk, talk. Ninety minutes of film. Sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. Henry Fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden or Martin Balsam.

The reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter Reginald Rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. Also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. Director Sidney Lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. He uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. ""12 Angry Men"" above all is a captivating character study. It is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. Exceptional film-making.

Side note: ""12 Angry Men"" was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by Jack Lemmon. A decent film, but no reason to miss the original.",10
23 November 2017,One location masterpiece,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story.

9 February 2013,Fireworks From Start to Finish,"There's some wonderful acting in Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), especially between Heston and Welles. There the characters don't duly wait for space to say their lines, they're impatient, try to cut into the conversation and steal that moment or two in the flow of conversation they know they won't be granted otherwise.

In this film Lumet goes as far one can go in this respect. The characters are no longer characterizations, they're real people, interacting with passion, conscious of their space not only in the room but in the conversational dimension, just like we are in real life.

The cinematography corresponds to this intimacy. The air is full of emotion, presence. I often consider Dreyer's ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" (1928) as the ultimate close-up, but it might as well be this one. I have never felt having been transported to a place with such frenetic control, oxymoronically speaking. This is fireworks from start to finish. Then again, the cinematographer is one of the great masters of cinema. Consider that this is the man who shot all those amazing interiors in Vigo's ""L'Atalante"" (1934), it's not entirely shocking that there's so many visually preternatural things transpiring.

Moreover, here one may find the crème de la crème of any version of Sherlock Holmes ever made, a whodunit in which logic is overturned by logic, emotion by emotion, recollection by clarity. A wonderfully executed study of thought guided by prejudice and assumption and of thought guided by passion for lucidity.

The Region A Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection is great not only for having impeccable image quality but also for the brilliant extra material.",9
20 January 1999,Incisive look at the jury system,"This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. Twelve ""ordinary"" men and women decide the fate of the defendant - how many are objective about the process? Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.

Even though the action is confined to one room, the dialogue kept me riveted to the screen till the end. All the actors portrayed the different personalities of the jurors very well.

2 September 2019,Brilliant Film.,"'12 Angry Men' is a drama film directed by Sidney Lumet. The film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant based on reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The defendant is an 18-year-old male. There are two witnesses: a lady from across the street and an old man who lives below the defendant. This is hands down my favorite film of all time. I could watch it repeatedly and never get sick of it. It's so well crafted and damn perfect in every way. It's a classic and when they attempted to remake it in 1997 it just didn't hold up to the beauty and standard that this film laid out. It's master craft filmmaking at it's finest. Henry Fonda is a standout in this movie, he is great! Being made in the 1950's I was very impressed with all of the acting involved with this movie, but Henry Fonda was my favorite. That is in part with the dialogue that this movie has for his character. It's so realistic and believable, and it is executed brilliantly. Every actor did a great job bringing their character to life, especially since none of them are given a name and we just know them as Jury Member 1, 2, 3 and so on. I have nothing negative to say about this movie, which is crazy because every movie is said to have some flaws; I see none here. The acting is great, the story is entertaining and real, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The way they use long shots and move the camera steadily around the room to capture different conversation in the beginning was fantastic. Also, there is one other long take that is worth mention. It involves this older gentleman, and he is getting tired and angry that this situation is taking so long. He starts to talk about the suspects ethnicity and saying he is guilty because his kind is always guilty, and they should all be put away. He keeps talking for the course of about 3 minutes and we slowly see every other jury member stand up from the table and walk away silently and ignoring him. This scene was so powerful, one because of the dialogue, but another is because it is one long scene and you feel what the other jurors are feeling the more the man speaks, anger. Overall, this is still my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen a movie that made me feel the way I feel every time I see it. I think this movie has something for everybody, even if you're not a fan of black and white films, I beg you to give this film a chance.",10
11 April 2008,1957 is a miracle year.,"Despite all the other great events and movies I may not know, since I was born in the 80's, I was awed by the two greatest productions of this year. The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window :) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a ""court"" movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time. When I realized this, I was fearing the next 90 minutes could be a boring torture. But I was sooooo wrong.

The interactions of all the characters are simply awesome. Henry Fonda is not less and not more than what he intends to be--a good guy. Thruogh the 90 minutes all he was doing was to bring justice and truth back to the eyes of jury, I was surprised by how advanced the director's cinematographic and editing were. The atmosphere of the jury room got more and more intense and it seemed the truth and righteousness was being enforced by some unseen hands. people may become stubborn, some of the jury even was so negligent that they never really cared about the death and life of the accused. But, this is still not the concentration of the movie. The movie, is a 1 and a half hours miracle about fate being changed, not about stubborn people's mind being changed.

Simply brilliant. And truly meaningful. The movie inspires people in many ways, including being a good man, which is most wanted in this century, I mean the 21st century.

10/10.",10
24 November 2012,Brilliant for an Old Film!,"This is a very unique and engaging film that takes place in just a single room. The discussions on a guilty charge is built upon with enough materials and suspense elements to cover the whole 1.5 hours without any need for the change of scenes or characters or any other plot twist techniques. And a brilliant masterpiece indeed! It is certainly not an easy task to make a movie like that with the same fixed setting. Probably this movie is smart enough to make up the number of characters to at least 12 men to make up for the rich details. But really, what other faults can you find in this movie with a perfect script taking place in one room for the whole time? What other flaws? I can't spot any.

6 August 2016,An ever-timely call to the human conscience,"No matter how prejudiced, preoccupied or plain angry you are, there's always a reason to slow down, step back and take a second look at things that seem obvious on the surface. That's basically the message of 12 Angry Men.

It's been more than 50 years since this film was released, and obviously the rules of cinematography have changed since then. Now such theatrical films may feel somewhat odd or staged, and, indeed, 12 Angry Men is more of a play than a film. However, it's a rare occasion when the pure idea professed by a film becomes a manifesto that goes beyond a particular epoch or style, acquiring that kind of topicality that lives forever as long as there is a mankind.

There's no point describing the events of the film, for they only serve as a means of delivering the film's message and call to our conscience, waking it up from the heavy dreams of our compromise-ridden lives. But it's the actors' work that turns the slow-paced narrative into a vivid showcase of emotions and characters. And even though Henry Fonda is the only big star of the cast, I can't say that the job is done by him alone. On the contrary, it's the men his characters confronts that really give the stage enough diversity and naturalness to feel real and true.

The expected happy ending of the film doesn't really chime in with the gloomy cinema trends of the modern cinema. However, the hope that it brings has a deep symbolic meaning. 12 Angry Men isn't about opposing good and evil people. It doesn't divide us, instead, it tries telling us that, despite how we look and act right now, there's something good and honest and kind in all of us, and the future of this world, represented in this film by the life of a young boy tried for murder, depends on our ability to stay true to those sides of ours and find them within, however muddied they might be. Each of those twelve jurors had certain principles that he was ready to put above his personal fancy. And I can only hope that in the world of today our own anger, vanity or indifference are still not strong enough to make us lose our light completely.",9
16 May 2018,12 Angry Men,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

12 Angry Men tells the story of one jury man who goes against the majority in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The story might seem rather boring and mundane, but it is quite the opposite. The story is told in real time and the debate between the characters is amazing. The dialogue is fluid and characters are complex yet simple. The ending is very good.

The acting is great. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber all perform very well. Henry Fonda delivers a stunning performance as a man reluctant to persecute under substantial evidence.

The pacing is perfect and the runtime is short.

The film is very old and this can sway some people from watching it.

Pros: Great story, good characters, fluid dialogue, great ending, good acting, amazing performance by Henry Fonda, perfect pacing, and a short runtime

Cons: The film is very old and some part don't hold up

Overall Rating: 8.9",9

26 May 2019,Excellent work by everyone,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.

Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.

Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.

Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.

Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.

Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).

Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.

Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.

Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.

Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.

Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.

Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.

Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.

Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.

The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",9
18 May 2020,When less is more,"12 angry men is a masterpiece of cinematic work. It was in those days and for me it still is. Put a bunch of diverse charactered people in a tiny room, give them a risky topic to discuss and see what a group dynamic can offer the audience. This movie proves, that if you have a great cast and a good written story, you don't need all that fancy stuff that's on movies nowadays. Simplicity sometimes is the key. I was involved and felt the high energy between these men. A must watch, if you ask me.

11 March 2016,"They just don't make them like this anymore, do they?","The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

25 September 2013,Rather Disorderly Men than Irate Men,"The inflamed comments are probably Pavlovian responses to the movie's politically correct quotient. Quality performers meet deep message. The most obvious flaw in this supposed classic, one of the most super-estimated films in history was as follows: real juries are allowed neither to carry their own experiences nor to consider evidence not presented at trial. If the jury had acted in accordance with the correct legal procedure, there would have been no basis for the plot, therefore no drama, therefore no catharsis. An intriguing theme doesn't always result in a good production. What shall I call a movie including clichéd, implausible characters, and a foreseeable twist (a 11-to-1 vote changing into 0-to-12)? Juries exist in order to allow the cold letter of the law to be broken, or temporarily suspended. That's what they're all about. That's their raison d'être. A judge can acquit a suspicious defendant for lack of evidence. A jury may convict him or her for ""feeling his or her"" guilt. The institution of the jury was thus an historical way to ""humanize"" lawsuits. If jurors were so one-dimensional, mindless and easy to persuade, courts should certainly keep them afar.",7

4 January 2021,Just Perfect,"In all the years that the film industry has been in force, massive and millionaire productions have been created... but films that I could say are almost perfect. No! Simply perfect, they would only be counted on the fingers of one hand.

The script is the most important thing from my point of view, plus the narrative; And this movie squeezed all this to its maximum potential, it knows when to take breaks to delve into the characters and explain why they act like this. Knows very well how to create tension in the necessary moments and later finish with plot twists. But the best thing about the film is the way it builds a world so real, so authentic to affirm that the characters are completely human, there is no hero or villain; There are no implausible situations that could only exist within a movie, thus doing the magnificent job of wrapping us in their world like no other movie.

12 September 2023,Flawless...,"I saw this movie on television by mistake, I meant to change the channel but the remote was out of batteries and I was stuck watching it.. Greatest mistake that ever happened to me honestly.. While I may be a 90s kid spoiled by mindless action and science fiction movies I still dare go as far as to say this black and white movie made in a time before I was born is the closest I have ever been to witness perfection in a movie.. Maybe other than The Godfather. I couldn't find a single production error, the camerawork was perfect and I couldn't find a weak link in the acting. The dialogue was absolutely superb, everything that was said and done had a point and it built up to something, no wasted scenes what so ever.. I don't use the word ""Flawless"" lightly but I truly believe this movie falls under this category!

I understand why this is considered a top 10 of all times movie, it's no easy task to keep the audience entertained through dialogue alone.. No snappy one liners, no car chases or gun fights.. Just dialogue.. And the entirety of the movie takes place a room consisting of 12 men deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18 year old boy and that's pretty much it... It's not an epic by any means but it doesn't need to be.

It's simplicity is in fact it's biggest strength.

If you haven't seen this already, do it now!!

2 November 2018,"With brilliant acting from the jurors, an engaging script and fntastic direction from Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men knows what it is doing and succeeds masterfully at it.","12 Angry Men is not an extravagant movie. Most of the film takes place inside a small jury room - no extravagant sets in this movie. This gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film - the acting, the dialogue (written by Reginald Rose) and the direction (by first-time director Sidney Lumet).

The acting is outstanding. There is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case, and simply based off this shot, we can tell so much about these characters - which way they will vote, whether they can relate to the boy on trial, and which of them will collide in the future. Special mentions of course go to Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda, the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie. Lee J, Cobb's revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters.

The dialogue is spectacular, and I am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen - possibly the best. Every character speaks based on their motivations: Juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas, Juror 3 speaks based on his own son, and Juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game. These motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers, and ths is exemplified in the script. This film also contains the single greatest line in film history, delivered by Juror No. 8 to Juror No. 3 after No. 3 threatens his life. When you watch the scene, you'll know the line.

And finally, the directing is masterful. The film's limited set means that the director, Sidney Lumet, had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film's storytelling. He does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie, and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor's faces, putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room. The scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis.

12 Angry Men is a smart and engaging movie, and feels like it was made with every element completely fine-tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time. I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone, not just to enjoy it, but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story.",10
30 March 2022,Outstanding Writing,"What popped out to me in this film is how about 90% of the film really was only in one room. With that being said, this story isn't anchored to just a simplistic set, it's amazing how well it's written. This film is a definite classic, and I highly recommend to watch this.

Overall, 8/10.

17 March 2017,12 angry men-- Guilty or not Guilty.,"My opinion---

First film (1957) by Sidney Lumet, first and gigantic success and even with nearly 60 years later, the film still has as much power. A superb legal drama, a masterpiece, a magisterial behind-the-scenes, superbly realized with an incredibly efficient scenario and which, in addition to a remarkable interpretation of the actors of this masterpiece, Anthology if any. A must.

5 September 2020,All the tools for quality entertainment,"I spent over 4 years representing students at my university and this movie pretty much displays how every meeting with the governing bodies is.

There's no sugarcoating it, I really liked this movie. The dialogue, the story progression, the fact that Piglet was voiced by the same actor who played Junor #2 here (his voice just struck my ears in a weird way and I only figured it out after the movie)... this movie has all the tools to entertain me.

17 June 2008,You're not really going to kill me are you?,"This is one of those great films that, at the time it is made, tackles a difficult subject, but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject's definitive movie reference point.

The story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father. Given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel, the case seems to be open and shut. He didn't know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures, he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father, he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene. Chances of mistakes, well, let's face it none. He'll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair.

In Sidney Lumet's supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script, storytelling or performance. The acting within this drama is superb and Henry Fonda is magic as Juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Everyone in the room is superb in their role, with a special nod to Jack Klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from, Joseph Sweeney as the shrewd eyed Juror number 9 is also fantastic, but for me E.G.Marshall and Lee J. Cobb (Arguably the most underrated American character actor) are magnificent in their roles as Juror's 4 and 3, the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and Lee J, consumed by anger over his own child's independence and taking that out in the jury room.

It is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that, although some of our current generation may find stagy and un-dynamic, is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world, and not necessarily for them.",9
24 March 2020,classic movie,"Its significance lies not in the result of ""innocence"", but in the entire debate process, which is a philosophical proposition about human beings and the world.

27 November 2008,A Classic movie which lives up to its reputation,"12 angry men must be one of the most unpretentious classics ever. The reason I say this is because most classics either have a reputation for being long epics about war and love (ala Gone with the wind) or for being slow moving movies which may not be accessible to all (ala Citizen Kane). But this one was different. It is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man's fate. The whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room. And it deals with human nature and how people behave when in a group. These are universal themes that anybody can relate to. The style is also very simple with no unnecessary complications or flashy camera-work.

12 jurors are now required to take a tough decision - to decide about the guilt of a young 18 year old boy. If found guilty, he would be put to death. At the beginning, most jurors are in agreement over his guilt except for one of them. That is Juror no.8 (Played by Henry Fonda). One of the jurors then gives an opinion that the rest of the jurors should try to justify their decision to juror no.8. The arguments go back and forth till the end. These exchanges are very interesting because of the emotional nature of the discussions.

Most of the jurors have set opinions on social issues and these are exposed during the discussions. Objectivity is in short supply and juror no.4, a stockbroker is notable in his objective analysis. Juror no.11 (played by George Voskovec) is also notable for his detailed analysis and opinions on the case. Juror no.7 is noticeably disinterested in discussing the case as he has already made up his mind over the guilt of the accused. He, in fact, is more interested in the baseball game in the same night and in cracking jokes when serious discussions are in progress. I did laugh at most of them. One of them, about a hair-splitters convention, was especially hilarious! Juror no.3 is one of the jurors who are convinced about the boy's guilt. He becomes too emotionally involved with the case and details and at one time even moves to punch Juror no.8 before he is held back by others.

Juror no.2 is usually timid but gives valid arguments when asked for his opinion. His exchanges are also sometimes quite funny! Juror no.5 is another person whose opinions are clouded because of his past perceptions and opinions. Juror no.1 is a man who tries to direct the group and he does his best to break up unnecessary arguments. Juror no.12 is an advertising executive who is quite self assured and confident at the beginning but then becomes doubtful about his opinions on the case. He sways back and forth based on the evidence presented and the arguments laid on the table. He tries to crack jokes and often the others don't find it very amusing. But once he makes an off the cuff remark and most of the jurors find it funny. It is scenes like these and the attention to detail that make the movie special. Juror no.9 is an old man who has lots of life experiences and speaks on the basis of that regarding the case. He also brings up some very good points especially one towards the end.

Henry Fonda is obviously the center of attention. With his kind eyes and his screen presence, he is definitely the pick of the actors. Jack Warden(Juror no.7), with his great sense of humour and easy natural acting style, is one of my personal favourites. It is quite unusual for a fifties film. Lee Cobb's performance as Juror no.3 was the most emotionally charged role in the whole movie and he has given a powerful performance that at times gave me goosebumps. This is one of the best acting performances on film. George Voskovec as Juror no.11, the immigrant watchmaker, is also quite good and he is especially good in the scene where he confronts Jack warden about his decision. That scene is my favorite in the film. E G Marshall as the stockbroker, juror no.4, gives an excellent performance as the impassive and objective man who gives his opinions in a detached manner without any emotional connection whatsoever. The others are also great in their respective roles.

I didn't expect to like this movie based on the premise but instead I loved this movie and it has become one of my favourites. This movie has great replay value and this is because of the great performances and the smooth screenplay which doesn't have one unnecessary scene which might drag the movie. This is one of the classics that might appeal to a large majority of people unless they get turned off by the premise itself. This is Sydney Lumet's masterpiece and it is such an original idea that it deserves to be placed as one of the great classics of cinema.

18 November 2004,High drama in a New York City courtroom with a man's life hanging in the balance,"***SPOILERS*** Given what at first glance seems to be an open and shut case by The State of New York vrs George Savoca in the murder, by Mr. Savoca stabbing, of his father. As the foreman of the Jury juror #1 Martin Balsam takes a vote from the 12 jurors including himself he gets an 11 to 1 vote for the conviction of Mr. Savoca. The lone dissenter is Juror #8 Henry Fonda who wants the defendant, who if convicted automatically gets the death penalty,to at least have his case reviewed and debated before he and the rest of the Jurors make a decision that may very well cost Mr. Savoca his life.

At first the debate goes nowhere until it becomes clear that the switchblade that Savoca was accused of using to murdered his father was not that unique. The fact that Juror #8 produced an exact same switchblade that he bought in a store some two blocks from the Savoca's home changed all that. Slowly one after another the men on the jury change their vote with Juror #9 and #5 Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman being the first two to change their vote from conviction to acquittal. The entire murder case hinged on the two eye witnesses, a lame old man and a near-sighted middle-aged woman, to the murder who lived across the street from the building where the murder was committed. The witnesses testimony was taken apart by both juror #8 and #9 when it was discovered that the old man couldn't have gotten, as he testified at the murder trial, as fast to the window to see the murder committed. As for the woman who was asleep, the murder was committed after midnight, she could not have gotten out of bed and seen, from some 60 feet away, through the windows of a passing fast moving subway train the killing without having her glasses on.

The film ""12 angry Men"" ends with the only holdout of the jurors to acquit Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb breaking down and finally voting to acquit Mr. Savoca. Fine courtroom drama that is as thought-provoking now as it was back then on the screen in 1957 with every one involved giving Academy Award caliber performances even though there were a number of factors that were overlooked by the jurors that may well have proved Mr. Savoca guilt. The knife that killed Savoca's, the same kind of knife that Savoca said that he had but lost the night of the murder, father was found on the street outside his apartment. Even though Juror #8 bought an exact copy of the switchblade knife, that Savoca was said to have used, in a store not far from him home it still didn't prove his innocence. The fact that Savoca couldn't explain where he was convincingly the time that his father was murdered, he claimed he was in a movie-house where no one working there or any customer could identify him. Being the one and only suspect in his fathers murder with a motive to boot, he got into a fierce fight with his father and said that he was going to kill him a few hours before Savoca's father was murdered. It was the eye witness testimony that failed to convince the jurors that had them vote to acquit him.

As convincing as the movie was in the jury acquitting Savoca in real life the jury would have in all probability have ended up by not coming to a verdict and ending up a hung jury. Two of the jurors #10 and #7 Ed Begley, Sr. and Jack Warden were more or less motivated to vote for acquittal by being intimidated and pressured by their fellow jurors then by the testimony. Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb was so unstable and emotionally screwed up that it's a wonder that he ever got on the jury in the first place unless he was such a good actor that he fooled the State prosecutor when he was paneled by him.",8

18 April 2016,a movie for actors,"In a NYC courtroom, a first degree murder case against a poor 18 year old boy with a troubled history has just rested. The 12 men of the jury are sent to decide the seemingly open and shut case. They hold a vote and it's 11-1 guilty. Henry Fonda is the only not-guilty vote. He's not sure and wants to spend time discussing the case.

This is the classic stage play. I say this meaning it's a bunch of characters in a room. The characters don't even have names. Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden have the flashiest roles. Henry Fonda is essentially the lead as the central heroic role. He has the nobility. The roles are all filled with first rate character actors. This is an actor's movie. The only drawback is the cinematic potential. In the end, it is 12 men around a table in a room. The visual opportunities are limited. Despite that, the debate interplay is engrossing and the movie is satisfying.

30 January 2008,Captivates even after half a century,"Crime and hatred are like continental boundaries, always hot and ever rocking the earth beneath our feet. We often lose moral balance and clutch to a stereotype just to keep our ground. But a single person's calm perspective and will for justice now and then help us to rise above our own prejudice. This movie is a bridge across an eternal boundary; has flaws, no doubt, like any bridge, but stands magnificently for 50 years and brings together people of all kinds. This bridge offers a view on the problems of society and a place for discussion.

This movie deserves its place among the greatest.

2 October 2020,"When Your Trial Comes, Pray for Juror #8","Watch the film and appreciate the acting, the writing, the camera work where you take a seat at the table, and enjoy Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) taking the prosecution's case apart.

Next, rewatch the first five minutes of the film.

You enter a large, imposing building. High-minded words adorn the exterior. The building has countless rooms, and many trials are underway that could determine the results of someone's fortune or whether someone gets to keep his or her liberty. Outside one room, a woman weeps while a man encourages her. Inside another one of these rooms, a bored judge reads instructions to a bored and inconvenienced jury, most of whom want nothing more than either to go watch the ballgame or else just go home.

Inside the jury room, almost everyone is eager to render a verdict, send a young man to the chair, and move on with their lives. (Did you see the news while we were in court? Would you like my business card? This fan doesn't even work, so we should hurry.) This trial is nothing but a distraction from the jurors' lives, and the sooner resolved the better. But, one man holds out.

The majesty and brilliance of the film is Henry Fonda's quest to convince the others to move beyond their personal prejudices and seek justice in light of the evidence. The terror of the film is that, in reality, most trials do not have a Juror #8.",10

In fact, it is unlikely that Hollywood would even TRY to stage a movie today in a locked room with 12 individuals spending 2-3 hours together to hash out a trial verdict. Yet Sidney Lumet managed to take this simple plot and produce an enduring and endearing movie for the ages.

Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman and great veteran character actors like Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam & E.G. Marshall make a wonderful array of living, breathing Everyman jurors. (And pipsqueak John Fielder -- Mr. Peterson on ""The Bob Newhart Show"" -- is an excellent foil to the bullying Cobb and Begley when he builds up his nerve!) The pace is steady and gradually builds to a climax without any of the Hollywoodish melodrama some 1940s & 1950s films had.

Maybe the best thing about the film is the wonderful black & white cinematography. Some of the close-ups of Fonda & especially the old man (Juror # 9) are downright eerie.

This is the kind of film and the type of performance that made Fonda what he was. This is a memorable triumph of mid-20th century Hollywood.",
21 November 2018,Everyone should watch this film !,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

20 December 2014,Amazingly Brilliant,"There are very few movies that make you go speechless, remain awestruck due to their sheer concept and execution. This is one such movie.

12 men, each from a different background, different views and opinions, strangers to one another, come together, along with their personal prejudices, to reach a decision acceptable to all. This line itself shows the magnitude of complexity involved, and to make a movie out of it is a work of true genius and a one that leaves you spellbound.

Right from the first shot, till the final one, you are so engrossed that you would even forget to breathe. If the background sound track, screenplay, script, direction are the cake, then the roles enacted by the characters (I say characters here, not the actors, because you believe they are truly the 12 angry men) are the icing on top of the cake.

Surprisingly it was only after the movie, did I realize that it was a black and white movie. The movie shows that to make a good movie, you don't need exotic locations or high drama, or superstars. All you need is a good story and good actors who make you forget they are merely playing their parts in the play.

The movie teaches you how an analytical mind and logical thinking can make a difference of life and death. It teaches you to be the most responsible when you have a person's life at stake. It shows how our personal prejudices and upbringing can affect our reasoning, how our senses play with our sense of judgment, how we let our emotions take over, at a time when it is required to be fair and impartial, how we tend to be a part of the crowd because we scared to be the odd – man-out. How one man, one true, sensible and empathetic man, it takes to make a difference. How important it is to have an objective and open mind, at any point of decision-making - in life/ death matters. How we are so stuck upon the facts and what we see, that we forget to use our mind, the ultimate powerful tool that we have. And that all it takes is sense and reason to convince someone, not decibels.

There are movies that make you laugh, or cry. There are movies that make you wonder and then there are movies that make you think, force you to ponder upon it, understand it, and learn from it (if possible). This is one such movie and a must – watch for one and all.",9

22 September 2021,Surprisingly Good,"This movie is seriously well done and a good and entertaining movie. Going into it, it sounded extremely boring just an hour and a half of nothing but talking happening. That's what it was but it was not a bit boring, the story was interesting and it's very well made. I mainly like movies with the least bit of action going on but this movie is a great example of a movie that doesn't need action and stuff happening to be good.

17 May 2016,"A film so good, you'll feel like you've gained insight into life and humanity","12 Angry Men is a film that's so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like you've gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. I mean it. It's really that good.

Twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. It's quite a simple premise – a jury's deliberation – one that occurs daily all over the United States. But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it's impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task – to search for the truth in a case of life and death.

First things first: let's just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is. This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. And yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. The dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. The pacing is also pitch perfect. The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds.

So yes, 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. But it's also so much more than that. It's a film about ""truth"": its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. Yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. The objective truth isn't the point. The point is the impressionability of the ""truth"" – how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. The beauty, as Henry Fonda's character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. The folly? The subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors.

But ultimately, 12 Angry Man a film about us – people. Each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well- balanced.

The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. But even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. It's extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the ""good guys"" and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the ""bad guys."" To invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting – seeing some of the jurors as ""all good"" and others as ""all bad."" We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them.

But in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? What drives them to act in the way that they do? No one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. The angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently ""all bad,"" but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). Of course, that doesn't mean that people can't and shouldn't be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs – we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. But that isn't the point. The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. As Juror #3 – who we've likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film – weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer.

12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. It's fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.",10

This movie teaches you that even when everyone may disagree with your beliefs, you must stand up for what you know is right. It also teaches you to never take the easiest path, take the one that leads to truth, justice and what is right, even if it may be more challenging.

6 April 2020,Cinematic Perfection,"Before nineteen fifty-seven, Sidney Lumet was an up and coming television series director with a number of different shows to his name. Talented the man obviously was even at that early stage of his career. Meanwhile (in fifty-six) Fonda has seen the TV play by Reginald Rose of the same name and had contacted him to see if the script could be adapted to a feature-length version for the silver screen. Subsequently they became co-producers and financed the film themselves, one of the greatest films ever made and put onto celluloid.

When filming began (which unbelievably only took nineteen days and three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or around three million today), Lumet would show the world just what an accomplished director he not only was, but would go on to be throughout the rest of his career. He truly belongs in the list of great American directors of all time, if not also the world. His vision, skill with the camera and obtaining the very best from his actors is second to none. 12 Angry Men shows all of his mastery and more (and was Oscar nominated for it) as he draws you deeper and closer into a story with a surprising amount of complex layers.

As just stated, while seemingly a rather simple story, 12 Angry Men does have numerous layers of complexity and social issues. These include bigotry, racial tensions, social standing, prejudices, personalities and morality. All of these issues can be seen within our twelve jurors throughout the course of the film while deciding the innocence of guilt of a boy on trial for murdering his father. At its most basic structure, this is a courtroom drama with a simple tale that is woven into an intricate, compelling and gritty drama piece. A wonderful show of how the judicial system should work.

The fate of a young ethnic boy lies in the hands of a jury, mostly made up of middle-aged white men. The entire film (with the exception of a very brief setup and epilogue) takes place within one small, claustrophobic room on a very hot day. We see nor hear any of the trial, witnesses or prosecution and only have a brief charge from the judge. Everything we learn about the boy, the case and all other matters we learn from our twelve jurors. As they file into this room we then quickly start to see which character is which personality and for what they stand and believe in. From this moment on you will be completely gripped.

Guilty until proven innocent and beyond all reasonable doubt are two importan phrases here and form the basis of the script and the conflict among our jurors. In life, far too many are quick to judge, along with also being judge, jury and executioner at times. Lkewise some of our jurors share the same thoughts. One man alone stands true to his beliefs and morality that the boy cannot be convicted unless there the crime can be proven 'beyond all doubt', an act the prosecution or accuser has to prove, not the defense. Something some people (along with our jury) sometimes struggle to grasp with the preconceptions.

This one man who beholds the rights of the constitution is juror number eight (Ford) who is the initial voice of reason within the group. Unlike many other reviews I will not spoil who is which character and what personal and prejudicial traits they have so you can ejoy finding out for yourself. I will however praise every single cast member, each one is wonderfully portrayed by seasoned and professional television actors. We have the meek, the controlling, the bully, the racist, educated, reserved, indecisive and the impatient as well as other character traits. All are shown brilliantly but special mention must go to Lee J. Cobb for his acting. Perfectly cast and intense in his performance that his character will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

Likewise with the acting, the script is simply superb. Tight, accurate and full of little twists and nuances, this is perhaps one of the best scripts you will ever hear spoken. Denzil Washington take note, this is how you write a dialogue heavy screenplay. No car crashes, explosions, fights, foul language, action scenes, just a taught expose of truths and half-truths spoken with conviction and heart from all those involved. You won't find many more films as utterly compulsive as this one. A real lesson to be learnt for any budding screen writer.

As is the direction and cinematography which are both second to none and while simple in concept, are exucted to precise perfection. it is often said that the simplest things are life are the hardest to master. Lumet and Kaufman master them with ease and give the film its extra edge that it needed. Kaufman who had previously worked on ""On the Waterfront"" is amazing and shows off his skill along with Lumet. In using techniques to make the room look smaller and to close in on the actors, make the room appear to be closing in on those twelve jurors the increasing tension between the men is really heightened at key moments.

Lumet also used different lenses and differing camera angles and heights to change or raise the mood as was needed. Many do not notice (a testement to his skill and the absorbing acting) but Lumet changes the height of the camera during the distinct thirds the film is broken into, slowly but surely ramping up the intensity and claustrophobia on us, the viewer while we see the same increase on the twelve jurors. Masterfully done. A film that has an intelligent plot (with a couple of little inconsistencies), believable characters and one of the few to be accurately labelled as a 'classic' in every way imaginable. About as perfect as you will ever get.

14 May 2022,Artistic Social Commentary,"12 Angry Men leads the viewer on a introspective journey, whilst thoroughly entertaining with the use of subtle suspense, keeping the viewer truly engaged. With the use of powerful theatrical techniques to enrich it's characters, it evokes the raw vigour and vivacity of real life emotion and mannerisms. In Angry Men, the jury becomes a microcosm for a male-dominated society on the precipice, stretching the moral limits of American democracy in a tense tussle between hope and ignorance. A truly American film.

25 July 2013,Remarkable,"What 12 Angry Men does is truly brilliant. The whole story unfolds in one single setting, and there is no action, yet conversation that somehow never bores. What the movie is able to achieve just through great acting and writing is astounding. It is hard to find something wrong with this movie if you focus on the right things. It does not matter if the boy was actually guilty, the movie is not a murder mystery, but that there is not indisputable evidence against him that would in turn sentence him to death. It makes you realize how defenseless one could be if he/she did not possess enough money for a lawyer that would properly defend you.

12 Angry Men is a classic that I was introduced to as ""an unforgettable experience"". Having watched it 10+ times, I now agree.

A 'must watch' for movie enthusiasts who love to see realism in written characters and read between the lines of their dialogues.

26 February 2020,"Almost perfect move, near 10. with a flaw","The flaw that makes this movie a 9 and not a 10 is that when the racist and the prejudiced jurors changed their minds it wasn't done very realistically in my opinion and more in a theatrical way that didn't feel very believable to me. I guess it was done so that there can be a favorable conclusion otherwise if it would be done more realistically it may had been a hung jury however I can't help but wonder it is possible to do it in a way that was believable and still have the same outcome so I guess that's something for future movies to achieve.

23 March 2020,A wonderful movie,"Its significance lies not in the result of ""innocence"", but in the whole debate process. It's a great philosophical proposition about human beings and the world. With the help of 12 jury debates, we can exchange and discuss such propositions as individual and collective, individual and society, truth and doubt, rank and dignity, opinion and understanding, reason and emotion, persistence and blind obedience, law and conscience, passion and calmness, bold hypothesis and careful verification. It's a collision of sparks and points directly to people's hearts.

21 March 2020,Just Amaziiing,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

5 October 2002,An acting and writing tour de force!,"12 ANGRY MEN is quite simply a film masterpiece. You might not know it from the description--12 jurors who are complete strangers to one another are collected in one room to decide a murder case. 11 believe the defendant, a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks and living in the slums, is guilty, beyond the shadow of a doubt. The last one, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), believes there is a reasonable doubt about the boy's guilt. How Juror #8 eventually gets the other jurors on his side is the point of the entire film, and it almost entirely takes place in the one small room. Hardly splashy, with no special effects--just 12 actors, a script, and the camera.

Sounds boring? This film is anything but. Reginald Rose writes a great story, and though you sometimes get the feeling that this film is meant to be a play, that's largely due to the slightly claustrophobic feel of having the entire proceedings of the film take place in one room. Works for a play, but in a film, one expects cuts to other places, wider shots etc. Still, even this counts in favour of 12 ANGRY MEN, because it forces one to concentrate on the case, the dialogue, the actors, the characters. Of course the film is talky. There's hardly any action. But it couldn't be more well-paced or timed. In fact, it's exciting, in its way. Every time a new vote is called, every time a vote changes to 'not guilty', the audience feels the triumph of something, some 'je ne sais quoi'. Director Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of manipulating the black and white medium he chose for this film, making the film timeless (even more so than the 1997 TV remake with Jack Lemmon in Fonda's role--yes, the jury is no longer one of '12 Angry White Men', but colour still dates a film in a way black and white doesn't).

The character study is really what makes the film: you'll recognise everyone in that jury room, from the non-strident nonconformist (Henry Fonda) through to the man who has such great difficulty separating his personal emotions from the facts of the case (a stunning Lee J. Cobb). There's the bigot (Ed Begley) who realises that his words will always fall on unsympathetic ears; the flighty guy who just wants to get to his baseball game (Jack Warden); the shrewd old man who shouldn't be discounted just because of his age (Joseph Sweeney); and the stuffy intellectual (E.G. Marshall) who isn't too uptight to change when he realises he's wrong. That's only half the cast of characters in this film, and aside from the rather unfortunate foreman or Juror #1 (Martin Balsam), every single character is well fleshed-out and a believable person. You can understand the reasons why they change their votes; it's all perfectly within character. Quite an accomplishment, to bring to life 12 men in the space of one and a half hours. Much credit, of course, must go to the writing of Rose for real, credible characters and dialogue. One remains riveted to the film even though it's mostly talk and no action; that's surely an indication of how great the writing and acting in 12 ANGRY MEN is.

Henry Fonda does a fine job as the man who initially stands alone with his own reasonable doubt. As usual, he underplays his character rather than grandstanding it, thus allowing for his fellow actors to shine in the showier roles. All of them turn in brilliant performances, but of particular note would be Cobbs, whose final impassioned stand as the odd man out (in a complete reversal of the beginning of the film) is simply stunning. Marshall and Sweeney are excellent in their roles as well.

This is most certainly one of the best films ever made: understated, underplayed, but definitely not over-rated. You've heard about 12 ANGRY MEN, I'm sure--so if you haven't seen it, why not? You're missing out on a great script, a great cast, and a great moral about the value of democracy in the American judicial system (one that isn't hammered into the audience--it's made with no self-congratulatory fanfare). Watch this--it's worth it.",9
28 February 2021,Far beyond Outstanding,"I cannot believe I never saw this film before. When I saw the rating of 9, and confirmation that this film is the fifth highest rated film of all-time, I could hardly wait to watch it. Most people would agree that the acting, script and direction are in a different sphere and I fully concur.

But what really makes this film stand out for me - and one for which I will never forget - is that we all have a voice, and we should never be afraid to use it. And never more so than the privelege of being a juror and not being dissuaded by ego, attitude or prejudice - even if a lone voice - but to act with integrity, decency honour and discernment, and most importantly of all - an open mind.

This film is a must-see, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

11 November 2021,Top Class of Acting and Cinematography. A Perfection of Attention to Detail !,"I remember 12AM is my first classic black and white movie i watched.

This is my first classic black and white movie and i instantly honoring it. Nevertheless, this stand at picasso class tier.

The cinematography is one of the best ever made. Seriously, it tought it was really really hard work to do. The attention to detail is very very in perfection. Actors positioning, camera positiong, wide camera shot, close up camera shot, is way on another level. The suspenseful nuance is penetrate deeply into the viewers, what a superb writing. The acting is flawless. Couldn't say no more, this movie is exclusively rare specie.

Therefore, i definitely say this movie is one of the best ever made. It stayed in my top 10 about nearly a decade and maybe for another decades !!!",10
5 November 2019,12 different characters.,"Whenever I watch a video, I always study the story structure. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a so complicated story However, when analyzed, I knew this is surprisingly simple structure. Consist of two lines. One is a mystery. Solving the mystery of the mystery was very easy, it is simple. The other is chasing human drama. The human drama is also relatively easy. However, when these two are mixed nicely the story structure come to looks very complicated. I think that is a point that aspiring movie write should study this case. And most important fact of this story is characters. Each character is vivid, characteristic. It generates human conflict. Among it, my favorite thing about this movie is Henry Honda's beautiful eyes. I think Henry Honda's eyes always have the power of justice in any movie he acts. Isn't this the movie that made the best use of the eyes of Henry Honda? I think that this is a timeless masterpiece.

8 September 2009,Utter cinematic perfection!,"Sidney Lumet's ultimate masterpiece ""12 Angry Men"" is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be.

The plot is simple enough. It's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. They (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. The entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote.

From the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. Also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. It is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided.

It's a masterpiece, I tell you. The screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (Reginald Rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. The ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. Is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? No one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, ""Who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?"" The theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way.

Apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), Sidney Lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. The fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. Nothing can be avoided. Also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. I read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (I watched the film again and this fact is true). Also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. I tell you, it's cinematic perfection.

The acting is point-perfect. Henry Fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden are equally powerful and entrancing. Overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. But it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. I mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that Hollywood spews out.

I've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age I happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many.

Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10
13 August 2008,"Exquisite, Effortless Brilliance","12 Angry Men - Top 15 films of all time

Sidney Lumet's masterpiece follows a group of 12 jurors deciding the fate of a young teenage in a case that is seemingly overwhelmingly against him. The votes start 11 to 1 in favour of guilty and the one juror (Henry Fonda) seems adamant that he is not guilty. Remarkably the whole 96 minutes take place in the jury room, its ever so simple but captivating throughout which is why this film deserves its mounted praise and my standings of it as being up there with Hitchcock's Vertigo.

Fonda pulled off a blistering and powerful performance playing the rebel of jury. He is the only one that has any belief in this seemingly condemned soul. But he teaches one important lesson that nothing is rarely as it seems. He manages to convince 11 other men of the jury that this man isn't guilty. A remarkable feat.

This is one of the few films that can truly be labelled as a timeless classic, this didn't need action or special effects, just sheer cinematic brilliance that shines through the flawless script and the dynamic direction.

Not only is the film convincing, its frivolously entertaining and a true milestone in cinematic history

5 May 2016,9 - Excellent,"Don't let the fact that this is an old black and white movie dissuade you. If you give it a chance, it will captivate you more than most modern movies. Sometimes less is more. With a low budget and a simple premise, strong acting, sharp directing and flawless writing really make this gem come together into something special.

It respects your intelligence enough to let you slowly piece together the evidence, and throughout the movie you'll see the gradual change in all of the characters. And with just the characters and a room, it feels like all twelve of them are fleshed out and believable. It's an essential watch for anyone who likes psychologically engaging movies.

11 November 2008,Brilliance Unlimited!,"Now here's that kind of a film, writing about which is a major task! Words are not enough to describe this gem, which after 51 years of its release, has stood the test of time..and still packs the punch. All the newfangled courtroom dramas of later times cannot hold a candle to this ""classic"" in the true sense of the word. I was shocked to read it performed poorly at the box office on initial release, in spite of the huge critical acclaim.

The movie, which is the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, is the film adaptation of Reginald Rose's play. The screenplay for the film was penned by Rose himself.

The story is fairly simple, with 12 jurors assigned the task of presenting a verdict on the case of a boy accused of killing his father. What seems to be an open and shut case, takes an ambiguous turn when one of the jurors votes ""not guilty"" against eleven others voting ""guilty"". This leads to some immensely gripping and taut drama full of very interesting debate that never lets up until the words ""The end"" appear on the screen!

Wonderfully directed by Sidney Lumet, this is quite possibly the best film of his career. There are lots of unique features of this film. The cast is all-male. None of the character names are revealed (almost). They only have a ""juror number"" to identify each other by. The entire film (with the exception of a couple of small scenes) is shot in one small Jury Room. The performances are all superb. The most notable ones are those delivered by Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Sweeney, George Voskovec, Ed Begley, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman.

""12 Angry Men"" is a movie that is sure to appeal to every generation. It is one of those ""immortal"" movies that never age with time! And it is surely an example for all filmmakers and movie-buffs. No special effects, no stunts, no gimmicks...just pure drama, thrilling and powerful!

Go and buy the DVD now..and preserve it..for your kids..your grandkids..your great-grandkids......",10

Too bad some people still have the mentality ""I will never watch a black and white movie"" like I did a couple of years ago. They'll never be able to understand what is it like to enjoy a very well told story.

The plot is very simple; one room and 12 men having a conversation about another's life. It starts kind of slow, but once it picks up, you'll be grabbed by the story and the discussion between the characters.

8 September 2022,Truly a brilliant film,"12 Angry Man is a brilliant movie about the value of a human life. Essentially, it is a discussion between 12 jurors who must decide on the life of a young man. The film takes place in real time and deals with important issues such as human morality and the fact that our decisions are shaped by our own experiences, prejudices and even selfishness. Each of the 12 men is different, has a unique profession that reflects his personality, and has had his own experiences in life. As a viewer, it's just exciting to see each perspective and how each one tries to argue. If there's one thing the film taught me, it's that our society only works as a whole, and only together can anything be achieved.

17 August 2021,SO GOOD!,"WOW!!! 12 Angry Men blew me away. It was just such a good idea for a movie and brought in some of the best actors of that time. This movie holds up so good and Henry Fonda was amazing, but my favorite performance was Lee J. Cobb's. The characters are my favorite they all have a little backstory and are all developed just amazingly. And the ending is one of the best I've seen!!

29 August 2011,Don't rely on snap judgment,"This movie was in IMDb's top 10 list over the best voted movies of all time. I knew nothing about this movie and was very eager to watch it so that I could see what all the fuss is about.

I can conclude that this movie raises so many ethical questions and the storyline is nothing less than perfect. The whole plot takes place in one single room and portrays 12 jurors with different backgrounds and points of view. One would think that this kind of movie would very easily get boring, but it doesn't at all. I was stuck to my TV screen for the entire movie.

The actors are outstanding and the writers of this movie have obviously done an excellent job. This movie has probably given a lot of people something to think about, snap judgment can be so wrong.

9 February 2021,The dialogue and story take you an a roller coaster,"Back in early 2020 I saw this movie was one of the highest rated on here. ""Probs just some old movie that people praise cs it's old and a classic."" Boy was I wrong. I completely loved this movie when I first saw it and a couple months later I rewatched it. Now I'm still eager to watch it again.

The dialogue and story just suck you in and take you on a wild ride. No action needed. Just twelve men and one room.

25 July 2009,Absolutely spellbinding,"I have never served on a jury and therefore have no idea what is involved in full but this film drags you into this jury room and makes you pay attention to every second and gives you an insight as to what could happen should you serve as a juror. Apparently all but 3 of the 96 minutes length of this film was in shot in that room. I am not into camera angles and lighting and such its the whole effect that I am interested in and the experience of watching this film was spellbinding. When I watch this film I am always drawn to the one voice in the room who isn't sure about the guilt of the accused. Just imagine being in his shoes under those circumstances and you can see how easy it would be to say yes he is guilty can I go home now, after all the eleven other jurors are probably right so I will just agree with them. But this one juror applied a certain amount of logic and was determined enough to resist the jeers and negative comments and demand that he be listened to and of course he gets his concerns over and most people know the ending. In real life a mans life could have depended on whether the guy was going to speak up or not. That is a scary responsibility.",10
3 January 2014,All Modern Filmmakers Should See This Incredible Film,"No car chases here. No crashes. No explosions. No loud noises. Very little music and no background music during the bulk of it. In fact, most of its action takes place entirely in one room and the action is the playing out of a grueling day in a dingy, hot and sparsely furnished jury room without pause. Yet this is one of the finest movies ever made.

Better acting you will not find in most other films.

And this puts modern movies - with all their stunts and special effects - to shame. This is an object lesson in what makes a great film. It's not noise and smoke and mirrors. It's a great story and great acting. You don't need a million cuts or scene changes. You need just one room if you have the essential elements, as this film proves.

The tension is incredible - palpable and nonstop, the important story of intolerance unfolding in a series of surprises and the human interplay almost unrivaled.

No bells and whistles here. Just one of the best stories ever featuring one of the best casts ever assembled. And one of the most memorable films you'll ever see.",10
19 March 2021,Cinema at it's finest,"Wow. I am at a loss of words. I simply cannot believe how perfectly made this movie is. Everything comes together in perfect harmony; The astoundigly well-written and 3-dimentional characters, all with their own unique set of quirks and ways of speech, and all backed up by excellent performances. The way personal opinions and prejudices hinder the factual discussions in really interesting ways, and how several character go through satisfying arcs as they realize what they're saying. The perfect pacing and the plot which doesn't give anything away for free. There is no definitive answer, we don't get to see the murder happen. All we get is 12 strangers talking about it for 90 minutes.

There's something mesmerizing about the unraveling of the mystery, the way each consecutive point made builds logically on what has previously been said, the way the camera slowly spirals lower and lower and the increasing use of close-ups to establish the increasing uneasiness among the men. I also absolutely adore the simplicity of it all. There has been a lot of movies mostly taking place in one room, Quentin Tarantino particularly is quite good at only using a few locations, but I am fairly confident in saying that there has never been, and probably never will be, any movie pull it off quite like this one. I can easily see why it's at number 5 on the IMDb rank, and I'm also confident in saying it's pretty damn high on mine. What a cinematic masterpiece.",10
22 March 2020,"Brilliant dialogue, revelations. Social commentary.","Stellar film, detailed dialogue, and poignant clashes of ideals. Took me a long time to watch this film, I'm young- older films can be a bit tedious when making a selection from the massive catalogue that exists these days. Do not skip this one if you're a fan of film and enjoy a larger cast with detailed dialogue!

12 May 2003,Truly Excellent,"1 room.

12 great actors.

1 cracking script.

0 big budget special effects.

Need I say more? Well I will anyway.

A simple message of communication, we can work anything out if we talk it over, and that decisions made from the heart are clouded with our own prejudices and emotions. It's a great film, one that requires an attention span of longer than five minutes. It gives us the bare facts and sticks us in the claustrophobic little room with the men, we become one of the jury.

Satisfying closure, and no need of a sequel, although I hear the remake is quite good. Whatever, just go watch it.",10
12 January 2020,Don't be put off by the description,"A black and white film consisting entirely of a jury arguing a case within the confines of the jury room, sounds like watching paint dry, right? Well that's what my perception was for years and was determined not to bother regardless of the strength of the reviews both from critics and fans.

But films that are mad as among the best have good reason for their reputations (usually). Like Citizen Kane I had to eat humble pie after watching this one. Even though I had already read how the film ended the journey was never less than fascinating and intense with some interesting points raised about class privileges and prejudices against people one might look down on based on their type. All the characters were fully fleshed and there were a lot of shades of grey to work through.

I love modern action extravaganzas such as The Avengers as much as the next guy but the beauty of film means that there is a full spectrum of diverse stories to be appreciated. I think if I had a bet with anyone who said this film ""sounds boring"" I'd make a profit if people gave the honest truth after watching it.",10
13 May 2020,Reasonable doubt,"Well i think it is the most incredible movie, the characters are specimens of our society from the worker to the boss from a young adult to the grandpa , it's a lesson about justice and life .

9 January 2022,Timeless masterpiece,"There's a reason this film has had its staying power. Any film that can remain visually and dialogically interesting in what amounts to mostly a single scene in a single location is worth its salt. Henry Fonda's performance is incredible and his supporting cast plays off him very well. You can't look away.

10 December 2019,All for a life and the element of doubt!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9

18 August 2002,A Who's Who of Character Actors,"This is another classic film which I am certain nobody realized would be a classic when it was made. I doubt that director Sidney Lumet realized fully what he had in the cast he assembled, for many of the names were not yet household words in 1957, the year 12 Angry Men was produced. The names are impressive: Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Robert Webber, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, John Fiedler and a very young Jack Klugman are the players we recognize today as belonging in the Who's Who of American character actors of the era. Edward Sweeney and George Voskevec, capable artists in their own right, round out the cast. The story intrigues. Except for short sequences at the beginning and end, the story takes place entirely within a stuffy jury deliberation room. A jury of 12 men is charged with determining the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. In the beginning of deliberations, only Fonda believes the young man innocent. The story's brilliance comes in how it progresses to 11-1 for a guilty verdict to finally a 12-0 vote for acquittal. Along the way, we are introduced to each of the jurors in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The reasonable juror portrayed by Fonda, the hot-headed ultra conservative played by Cobb, the shallowness of Warden's character, and E.G. Marshall's thoughtful stockbroker are a few examples of character development within the setting of a jury room on a hot night.We learn much about the background and psyche of each juror as we progress along and the talents of each cast member shine brightly within the framework of an interesting story, a story which contains more than a little bit of social commentary on the times in which it was filmed.

12 Angry Men is a must see for anyone interested in the human psyche and social commentary.",
28 February 2004,Now this is acting!!,"'12 Angry Men' is not quite the astoundingly great film it's made out to be, but it's definitely one of the measuring sticks for ensemble acting to this day. Great acting all around and superb direction from Sidney Lumet, who never made a better film in his career. This movie is basically one long scene, and it never gets boring. Some of the arguments about the trial are really stretching, but in the end, the trial is not even what the film is all about. Fonda is great, as always, but the glory here goes to Lee J. Cobb. Cobb is a powerhouse and probably was never better - 'On the Waterfront' included.

22 May 2021,Best pleasant surprise,"I have watched this movie as part of one of the political science classes I was taking in college. Black and white movies usually throw me off, so I didn't have huge expectations for the movie. But boy, did it exceed them! This movie is an example to what you can accomplish when you have a killer script! One of the best movies of all time despite having a limited budget, no action scenes, or no hollywood icons starring.

10 March 2020,12 ANGRY MEN (1957) - 21/10/2019,"12 Angry Men proves that a masterpiece is all in the details. This is, without a doubt, one of the best dramas ever created. Nice short runtime, small cast, all filmed in one room.m, it's just so tight. The beauty of it is that just from dialogue alone we are thoroughly entertained and it maintains a sense of tension throughout. The crime is never re-enacted, it's from the descriptive dialogue that we picture it in our heads. Writer Reginald Rose knew that the most powerful tool in film was words. The cast was high calibre, Henry Fonda leading the view of not guilty. It's pretty difficult to go against him when he is full of suaveness and so convincing. We get to know each juror as the film goes on and we soon start to explore the possibility that their personal lives are tainting their decision. That, was what made it so palpable. It was clouding their judgement, and their stubborn personalities made it all the more satisfying if they did change their mind. Persuasion is a powerful tool, but add a hint of conviction and you can manipulate anyone's mind. Several nice details were included, I like the fact it was set on the hottest day of the year. The heat evidently getting to the jurors, it made them more irritable and heightened the angry emotions within. Director Sidney Lumet did so much in such a little space, technically. When the jurors enter the room, its a sublime long five minute shot and he manages to share the screen time with each juror equally. He was able to convey their personalities instantaneously just by their attire, then when the discussion commences we start to dig a little deeper. The screenplay really is the winner here, if anything it makes me want to work in law. Dramas do not come better than this, 12 Angry Men easily gets the perfect rating. It sits in the inclusive list of masterpieces.",10
19 April 2020,Wonderful!,"The highlight of the whole movie is that the shooting location is in a conference room and toilet, which can be said to be a simple and single scene. Through dialectical discussions and objective statements, some people's subjective ideas are broken. The film focuses on the dialogue and debate of the characters. The protagonist understands everyone in a dialogue with an individual through his sharp observation. He finds a breakthrough through dialogue and some of their language and expression and then slowly break their ideas one by one. The film pays attention to dialogue and expression, and it is very wonderful to reverse the things with a small probability!

25 November 2008,A nugget of Lumet...,"It's case of 18 years old boy who killed his own father with a knife & there are enough testimonials & proofs to prove him guilty. A jury consists of 12 men has been appointed to solve this court trial with their unanimous vote in a room. Now this is not the usual plot. It's the thesis of the film. How it become anti-thesis & arrives in the end with synthesis on a discussion table among these 12 jury is a thing to watch here. Sidney Lumet has directed so many brilliantly scripted films but this one is his real masterpiece & remains classic forever. Without a doubt this is Henry Fonda's career best performance played with a reasonable nuance. Lee J. Cobb as the last stubborn man standing also did a brilliant work.

Highly Recommended.

21 December 2016,Great dialogue,"Finally got around to watching this, annoyed I did not do so years ago as it truly is one of the greats. I can see now that this film inspired many to come afterwards.

The film is for those who like a good dialogue. Well written and some great acting, no Hollywood clichés the actors speak normally and realistically. It is pretty much filmed in one room so this makes you concentrate and listen to what the actors are saying.

We are in a time when CGI and special effects are everywhere. A film such as 12 angry men is a welcome change from this.

Special mention to Henry Fonda, great actor.

6 March 2013,'12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic,"The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. At the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old Latino from the slums, be executed by the state.

Initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. However it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' - there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game.

Only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death.

I've praised films such as 'Killer Joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. However, compared to '12 Angry Men', 'Killer Joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose.

At the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. Some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. The natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths.

Sidney Lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility.

'12 Angry Men' is a film I truly admire, a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations - it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date.",
7 November 2021,Truth does not exist,"This film is a masterpiece. I've seen it at least a dozen times, and every time it's more and more beautiful! It is not a treatise on how to discover the truth, on the contrary ... the truth often does not exist, except in those who have actually carried out certain actions, but Justice, in almost the whole world, is based precisely on trying to get as close to the truth as possible. Very often this approach is horrible, as we have seen many cases of acquittal, as there is the classic ""reasonable doubt"", and it is precisely here that the authors take us. The truth does not exist, even the Juror 8 repeatedly says so, the fate of many men and women is linked to a very thin thread, which other men and women have to decide whether to cut or not. Justice, when addressed in any film or novel, is a very hot topic (see O. J. Simpson or Robert Durst, but there will be hundreds of them we don't know), because it involves so many variables. I believe that this film must be seen and analyzed by anyone who approaches the subject of Justice, whether it is his job or a ""normal"" juror or citizen who wants to judge!

22 May 2022,Justice,"A production that answers the questions of what is justice and how should justice be done.

A masterpiece that every lawyer should watch.

Although it is old, it does not bore at all and is the type to be watched in one breath until the end.

27 October 2019,The acting is top notch here,"Every delivered line feels natural, almost as if these guys were locked in a room for days, the ebbs and flows of interaction, the heat, all playing a role in determining the verdict.

It takes a special talent to make a room full of men interesting enough to warrant a whole movie. And the last scene just feels like a cathartic breath, like the city itself has new life.

A great film. Not exactly the most groundbreaking, but the acting was just phenomenal. Maybe a bit overacted at times, but the yells of frustration felt real and the dialogue smooth.

All of it culminating in a film with an important, human message at a time in history when prejudice was still very pronounced.

27 May 2006,Close to a classic,"In my continuing quest of watching IMDb's top-rated films, I rented ""12 Angry Men"". Currently, this film is ranked #18 on the list. With names like Reginald Rose, Henry Fonda, and Sidney Lumet, the movie seemed very promising. ""12 Angry Men"" was also another example of bringing yet another well-received teleplay to the big screen, as had been done very successfully with Rod Serling's ""Patterns"" and Paddy Chayevsky's ""Marty"".

Others here eloquently provide detail on the plot and characters. Simply put, the movie is filmed almost entirely on a single set, the jury holding room of a courthouse, where a jury of 12 men are deliberating the fate of a young man accused of murder.

Many plays and musicals have been adapted for the screen and the list of failures is long. A notable recent example for me was ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"". Film viewers do not have the same expectations of a presentation as do theater viewers. In film, the expectation of greater variety and coloration is a prerequisite due to the viewer's previous experiences. Therefore, the danger of becoming ""stagebound"" can ruin a film's reception. For a play such as ""12 Angry Men"" where the focus is declamatory, this is an unavoidable danger.

Happily, I found the film to be a resounding success. The strength of Rose's adaptation is complemented by Lumet's probing camera, which delineates the characters not only through impressive tight-focus shots, but through body language, gesture, and facial expression. The ensemble acting, underpinned by Henry Fonda's performance, is superb, as one would expect with such brilliant character actors as Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, and Ed Begley Sr. The storyline moves propulsively to a logical but powerful conclusion.

I can't really think of any flaws. Some confrontations involving prejudicial statements are a bit obvious, but are unfortunately as relevant today as then.

I wouldn't rate this as #18 on my list - I found the aforementioned ""Patterns"" to be a more engrossing film - but it's undoubtedly close to a classic. Kudos to all - I give it a 9.",9
3 July 2019,wow...just wow,"I had some prejudice before watching this movie, my boyfriend has watched it a few months ago and asked me if I want to watch it with him and I said:"" no the movie is black and white I dont want to."" I mean I didn't expect much but now I am speechless. Its simple but great. I wish I had watched it way more earlier and I wish the that the movie were a little bit longer because I didn't want it to end, thats how great the movie was in my opinion. Prejudice can kill you.

15 January 2020,Old but gold !!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
19 March 2020,The Life,"From the perspective of the jury, this movie makes every audience seem to be one of the members, and at the same time, it is superbly controlled by group dramas, so that none of the many characters has become a Facebook character. Each one is So lively and three-dimensional, it is fascinating to debate the social system, human nature, and thoughts beyond the case itself, and it is the respect for life.

12 July 2010,Human life don't mean as much to them as it does to us!,"How I managed to avoid seeing this critically acclaimed film up to now is a mystery. After watching a piece of complete and utter trash last night, I have to revert to something of quality to cleanse my palate.

Henry Fonda, the calm voice of reason one one side, and Lee J. Cobb screaming on the other. Ed Begley plays an enraged racist that mirrors Cobb's anger.

Some of the best actors of the time were in that room: Oscar winner Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, double Oscar-nominee Jack Warden, Cobb with two Oscar nominations, and Oscar winners Begley and Fonda. They played their parts brilliantly, giving us an insight into their characters and how that influenced their decisions.

Simply amazing!

3 May 2007,The jury has reached a verdict,"This near perfect, post-courtroom exploration of the twelve jurors who were to decide one boy's fate is every bit deserving as accolades would suggest. A shot to my dying cinematic heart, this film's staggering focus took an involving legal story and brilliantly merged it with a complex and diverse character study, making 12 Angry Men one the most engaging ensemble works of American history. Packed almost entirely into one plain meeting room for deliberation, the simmering screenplay should keep anyone glued to their screen into the very last frame; tension like this is simply unavailable these days. Equally effective as a plot-deducing mystery and gripping morality play, the genius behind this legendary feature lies in a seamless combination of those two particularly strong traits.

Delivering the film's highest ideals from page is an absolutely flawless group of men who are highly synergistic on top of their incredible individual takes. Though Henry Fonda will be remembered as the central character, the level of professionalism coming from the remaining 11 demands complete attention. Therefore singling anyone out would be a lost cause, except for studying the intricacies of any of the individually sublime roles. Some have characterizations that dwarf others, many take up less screen time then a few key players, but all in all the respect and generosity given to manifest each different personality is astounding and echoes the most transcendent aspects of dramatic form as we watch the mesmerizing layers of human consciousness become peeled away.

Essentially it is that timeless and eloquent capturing of a man's mind on the brink of justice that will keep 12 Angry Men forever fresh in our hearts. A historical directing debut for Sidney Lumet proved that his years working in television were not in vain. Exquisitley shot, even many technical setbacks will do nothing to distract from this commanding work. From start to finish, the film is testament to singular creative glory, only slightly betrayed by an overplayed cathartic climax.",9

23 December 2020,"12 Great Performances, stunned","This movie is the definition of Old is Gold, 12 great performances gave us 12 Angry Men.

The movie is about the Jurors who are about to give a death sentence verdict to an 18-year-old. The entire movie takes place in a single room with 12 jurors, now the first impression will be won't it be theatrical? Absolutely no. Normally we may feel a little claustrophobia coz of a single room but this movie never ceases to amaze us. Just magical.

This is what you get when you have amazing actors and a great director who knows what he's doing. A courtroom drama that got the best screenplay ever, absolutely astonished. Never have I ever thought that 12 men talking will keep me glued to the seat.

8 October 2012,"Flawless,unique masterpiece","12 Angry Men is a unique,remarkable film for a lot of reasons.One reason is the flawless direction from -one of the best directors of all time- Sidney Lumet.

Another thing is the exceptional acting from all the juries,the simple yet superb plot and of course the fact that in the 96-minute-long film ,93 minutes of it take place in one and only set!

But what makes 12 Angry Men truly exceptional is the deep psychological analysis and presentation of all the 12 juries.

One could say that every jury is an allegory,a symbolism of a human being's type of personality,but looking at it that way,it seems that anybody is as different with anybody as the same .The only thing that determines is the experience that one has.

The film also is so powerful that you can't but put yourself in the place of the one that decides.Could you decide about another man's life? And who makes you responsible?Is the law just?

These are just a few reasons that 12 Angry Men is simply one of the best films of all time,and probably the psychologically deepest -maybe along with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest- one.",9
14 January 2007,Excellent performances that stand the test of time....,"I have watched this movie many times. I finally bought the DVD the other day and watched it again! The level of acting and the intensity of all the performances have, without exception, always taken my breath away. It is a movie that I love and never tire of watching.

You forget, as you watch the movie, that pretty much the entire movie takes place in one room. Movies today, actors today, would not be able to maintain the level of suspense that this movie created and hold your attention for the entire hour and 36 minutes. It starts off slowly, and you become part of the jury stuck in that ""jury room"", frustrated as one man holds out because ""he is not sure"".

Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance as the one-man holdout but all the actors give tour de force performances, and you sit mesmerized as one by one they are all converted. But it is Fonda and Lee J Cobbs, as they fight for the hearts and minds of the other jurors that keeps the tension going. The movie was a good social commentary of the times, regarding the racial intolerance, prejudices and biases that governed people in that era. And watching it again today, I would say not much has really changed!",10

2 July 2016,Best Ensemble Cast Ever,"12 Angry Men

Written by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet. 12 Angry Men is about a jury who starts off 11-1 for guilty of a murder case. It's up to Juror #7 to show reasonable doubt. The film is an ensemble cast with great direction. Wide shots inside a jury room allow for whatever the main focus of the shot to also include the acting of others behind or along side. Continuous acting, and if in the hands of a different director like say Scorsese or Spielberg, I would have imagined one long 90 minute take.

Juror #7 played by Henry Fonda, best know for The Grapes of Wrath and Once Upon a Time in the West, is the main holdout who goes on to try and convince the other jurors who have their reasons to think he's guilty. Some are just going along with the crowd, some have personal issues, and some just aren't convinced. Fonda does a great job acting as an every man with some doubt.

Juror #1 played by Martin Balsam, best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's and Psycho, is the person who is in charge of voting and for the most part keeps his opinions to himself.

Juror #3 played by Lee J. Cobb, best known for The Exorcist, is by far the most interesting if not most stubborn character in the film. He yells, is arrogant, and has it in his mind that the boy murdered his father. It's not until the final minutes of the film that you get to know more about his character, but boy is it worth it.

Juror #7 played by Jack Warden, best known for All the President's Men, but I first saw him in Problem Child as Big Ben. He plays a baseball fan that just wants to get out of the room as soon as possible so he can go see a ball game. It was great seeing him throw in little chimes every now and then as jabs towards the other jurors opinions causing more...anger. See title.

This film lost three Oscars to The Bridge on the River Kwai. A movie that's now on my to see list. With it's wonderful acting it only makes me want to see the other more.

Verdict: Best ensemble cast movie I've ever seen. For a movie that doesn't change location, it has surpassed Reservoir Dogs and Saw. That means a lot. Go rent/buy this film.",9

2 September 2023,Pretty Good,"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.

While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.

The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.

11 June 2003,values,"Of course Twelve Angry Men is about the legal system in the US. Of course it is considered ""artsy"" in part since it is low budget and filmed in black and white.

But above all it is cinema that has the three basic ingredients of what makes a great movie: a good screenplay, great actors and impeccable photography. Cinema started as filmed theater and IMHO any film should be aware of its origins. As soon as a movie denies its origins totally and turnes into a computer generated roller coaster ride, I don't like it.

I don't say all films should play in just one room. But the ""real time"" feel should be explored much more often in movies. Hitchcock did it with ""Rope"" and I think he did it excellently.

Twelve Angry Men is based upon a television play. These were transmitted live (!!!) back in the 1950s because the video tape didn't exist back then - so we can speak of theater. The movie itself has very much the same feel to it. I like the interactiveness between the actors and the ""modern theater performance"" used back then. In recent movies we can see all too often an actor caring about his/her facial expressions when filmed and caring about the voice at the studio dubbing stage. In this film everything what you see and what you hear looks 100% natural.

I am especially overwhelmed by the values transmitted by the main characters. Honest Hank (Henry Fonda) is of course the most likeable character. E.G. Marshall stands out as well. But it's the great, late Lee J. Cobb who runs away with the movie in his final scene. Very powerful. Watch it!

One of the finest movies ever!",10
18 July 2019,gg,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",
16 July 2021,A timeless classic that everyone should watch,"My first time seeing this was in Civics class in High School. Me, along with almost everyone in my class was in love with it from beginning to end.

It doesn't seem like much, but it is such a great film. Great characters and acting. Great pacing and and interesting plot. I have nothing but great things to say about this movie.

28 July 2009,A film with 12 stars,"Let me start off by saying I couldn't expect anything more from a film than what ""12 Angry Men"" provided. I don't know how else to describe this film than by writing the following statement. ""12 Angry Men"" is immaculate, impeccable, flawless, perfect and astounding. Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and White{released way back in the year 1957}. So whats so great about this film you ask? Well to start with this film has 12 stars...Have you ever seen a film with more stars? Probably not. These 12 stars are none other than the 12 Jurors who have to decide a boy's fate. All they have to do is to vote whether the boy is GUILTY OR NOT? What follows is the greatest and maybe the longest conversation in a film I've ever seen. You won't believe how different and unique these 12 men are.

Juror#1 : A guy who appears confused and tries to calm everyone else around him so that they can reach to a conclusive verdict.

Juror#2 : A shy person who doesn't speak his mind but understands the situations.

Juror#3 : A dominant personality who appears very firm and a successful businessman.

Juror#4 : The most logical of all.

Juror#5 : A young man from a violent slum who maybe understands the boy's situation the best.

Juror#6 : A well built man, principled and respectful.

Juror#7 : A sports fan who doesn't care much.

Juror#8 : An architect who deeply thinks about the case.

Juror#9 : {I liked all the characters but the most interesting was this one} A wise old man whose experience speaks for himself.

Juror#10 : A foul mouthed and an aggressive person.

Juror#11 : An immigrant watchmaker and a supporter for the justice.

Juror#12 : An advertising executive who likes to be with the majority.

As someone had commented before ""If you ever see only one Black and White film make it this one""...Rightly said. Kudos to that Guy. Will always remain in my Top Movies list. Go see it!

8 April 2021,A masterclass in direction.,"I was a bit reluctant to check out this one at first. It looked a little dull on the face of it, 12 guys in one room arguing about a court case.

But after it was recommended to me by more than one person, I thought I'd give it a go.

The acting by all 12 is excellent, the questions asked are intriguing and make you rethink the judgements you make, and the suspense and tension is measured brilliantly throughout.

The physical 'action' as such isn't the main driver of the film, so it won't be to everyone's taste, but I found this to be a superb character piece that definitely deserves the accolades it gets.

23 July 2021,NOT GUILTY.,"I've watched this movie 64 years after it came and it's absolutely stunning how gripping, engaging drama it showcases even today.

Just 12 guys in a room with a single guy having reasonable doubt about crime and how he turns rest of the jurors with absolute logic and observation skills is sheer brilliance.

The success of these type of movies lies in connection they make and impact they create with characters, in this particular movie even with a room and a fan.

We can visualise the entire crime scene with just their arguments and counter arguments.

Successful drama essence lies in making us feel we were there.

This movie has done a extraordinary job.

All characters are equally important they are like moods of a single person.

Arguably one of the iconic courtroom drama ever made without actually a court room.

Writing is top notch.

One of the best classic drama that lies in one's mind for a long time.

One must not miss it.",10
23 March 2021,This is just pure genius!!!,"This movie was made during the infancy of Democratic world's justice system. The characters are intriguing,the acting and emotions make you feel the depth of the characters ,it touches the core of your morality. But those are not what astounded me the most. 12 men and a room- that did. You don't need big budget cgi or gimmicky action scenes to make a great movie ,this piece of art is the proof of that.

31 January 2022,Extrodinary,"It is one of my favourite movies i had ever seen. I dont know how about to start. Everything it was amazing ,the plot the director. I didnt want to finish the conversation was from an other planet. I can see it 100 times again and i will never be bored with this movie. All the actors they was amazing. They traveled me to '50 America and i learn about their ordinary lifestyle. I learn to not judge everyone from the cover and give a try to learn from them atleast something. I suggest evereyone to see this movie atleast one time at his life. I wish one of our days one director to create a masterpice like this again and i am hopefull about it. At the end i want to tell once again that this movie was extrodinary and a man can create such a good movie with using only one room if he really want it.

21 May 2013,A tug-of-war battle between morality and rationalization,"It's amazing how 12 Angry Men can make other movies seem gimmicky having to rely on props or set pieces to make the audience feel immersed only to feel let down in the end. And that is due largely in part to its acting performances. Never would I have thought I would ever feel tension just from the use of dialogue, but '12 Angry Men' proved me wrong showing that if you have a good plot and a good script, then you can make a quality film without the use of large sets, car chases, gun shots, and beautiful scenery shots.

There was never one moment in this film where I was not paying attention. One reason I can give for this is the distinctiveness of each and every character. What I love is how every juror is different from one another hailing from many different backgrounds. Just listening to these guys talk made me want to get to know everyone of them and what their motives were and how it would affect the outcome of the story. As the story progresses, you get more and more immersed as things start to get tense and personal in situation in which extreme rationalization is required in using reasonable doubt.

What also makes this film rewarding is that you feel like one of the jurors and it makes you want to think just as hard as they're thinking about the case. There are twists and turns here and this is not a simple case to analyze when everything is not pure black and white. When we're only presented with very few details, we can only look to the unseen details that could give us a strong reason to doubt a person(s)' accusations. This is a story that is universal and how reasonable doubt must be taken into all accounts when there is blurred line between who is right or wrong and who is good or bad.",9
12 August 2023,Never old,"One of the best classic movies which had ever been made, with a magnificent storyline, script, actings and cinematography, that when you perceive it as a whole everything just seems prefect about the movie.""12 angry men"" is one of those classics which will never get too old for us to enjoy, the movie has the potential to be opened up from different angles and there still will remain something to learn. The movie keeps in itself lots of humanistic ideas of how society, culture and civilization should be like, it shows how all the humans are good in nature, how they can change and understand one another and be good. Kind of an idea which we are far from now days. The movie demonstrates the power of an individual to change the whole course of human fate and also a trust to humans logic, reasons and doubts. Sidney Lumet definitely did his best to form the movie with the help of some the greatest actors of that time whom none of them are alive today and only their legacy remained.

There is no action or comedy in the entire movie (except for maybe like one or two jokes) so I can see why a little kid wont like it. I just liked it because of the message and drama. Not really a movie you want to watch over and over again, but I could definitely watch it again with my family some day.

1 June 2020,Time!,"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous. The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints. In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split. Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle. Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote. Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty. Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting.",10
6 July 2020,OUTSTANDING COURTROOM DRAMA,"A sensational murder occurred at around 11pm in NewYork City. Based on eyewitnesses, police arrested the victim's 18-year-old son as a suspect killer. When this case appeared at the courtroom, the judge ordered the jury board, consisting of 12 unanimous members, to place their verdicts of the fate of the accused youth. The jurists have to vote on either """"guilty"" or ""not guilty"". After the session ended, those jurists gather in a closed-door meeting.

All jurists arrive from different backgrounds, professions and areas. They don't know each other. Jury Foreman, who is jury 1 (Martin Balsam), starts the meeting and requests all jurists to put their verdicts by raising hands. At first, except Jury 8 (Henry Fonda), all agree that the boy was guilty and he stabbed his father to death. Everybody asks why he does not agree with them. Jury 8 says that there should be some discussion needed before putting their decisions. Jury 8 also said that he doesn't want to say that the youth is fully innocent but he has a doubt about proving his guilty and he doesn't want to make an innocent punished due to the lack of strong evidence. One by one, he questions the overall investigational activities of this murder. He points the reliability of the murder weapon, witnesses and the circumstances. Jury 3 (Lee J. Cobb), who has been estranged from his own son, is vehemently against Jury 8 because he thinks that a son could murder his father as the accused youth has a violent past and Jury 10 (Ed Begley) who uses too many vulgar words to others especially Jury 8. Other jurists were also critical against Jury 8. Despite the criticism and offend, Jury 8 remains too calm and analytical throughout the jury meeting and explains his viewpoints. One by one, jurists feel that there are still lots of hidden facts that are not properly dig out before.

The acting of all jurists were remarkable, especially by Henry Fonda as Jury 8. The way he explained his viewpoints to his counterparts was enjoyable to observe. It teaches us how to stay calm and quiet in turbulent situations where everybody is against you.

This film was nominated for Academy Awards in the categories of Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing of Adapted Screenplay, however, it couldn't won none of them. As per Rotten Tomatoes, it is the highest rating earned courtroom drama of all time.",10

19 December 1998,The greatest movie I have ever seen.,"One of the all time greats. The cast is incredible. Everyone has a unique personality. My favorite is Lee J. Cobb. "" Rotten kids- you work your life out."" The dynamic between certain of the actors is great. Edward Binns to Lee J. Cobb: Why are you talking like that to him for? Man talks like that to an old man really ought to get stepped on. You ought to have more respect mister. You say stuff like that to him again; I'm gonna lay you out."" I own the video and have watched the movie dozens of times. The remake in 1997 pales by comparison.

1 June 2006,simply a classic,"Well, this ought to be among the best movies ever made. The full movie has been made in a court room with jurors all of whom have acted par excellence.

henry fonda delivers his best performance, the points were brought out subtly and the reactions displayed by each person was warranted for and seemed very realistic.

the direction is flawless and then the movie again proves the age old saying ""dont believe what you see or hear, come to a decision only after deep introspection"" Henry fonda who is the lone man against 11 others slowly wins the confidence of the rest to free the accused of guilt.

wonderful movie, must see.

7 January 2022,Greatest movie ever,"Amazing acting, camera work, and writing. You really feel like you're trapped in a hot room with these characters slowly getting crazier and crazier deciding the fate of a boy none of them know. I've watched this movie once a month for over a year. It's my all time favorite movie.

13 August 1999,Fantastic.,"I am not big on watching old movies, for many reasons. Black and white does not bother me, but the poor film quality and the cheesy special effects (like using iguanas with stuff taped to them for dinosaurs), when there are any, are very distracting. However, my biggest problems, and really the only ones that prevents me from watching a lot of them, are the overacting and the hokey dialogue. This movie is one of the few of its day that I have seen that does not suffer from these problems (the others being mainly Hitchcock films- there was never any hokeyness in those). Instead, it is a great character study. The dialogue is believable. Really the only thing that makes this movie unrealistic if it were to be set in the present day is the absence of non-white jurors (of which the remake took care of) and of women (which the remake did not address). Other than that, this movie could easily have been made in 1999 instead of 1957.

So for those who shy away from old movies, don't avoid this one, because it is easily one of the best films ever made (hence its ranking in the Top 250 on this site). Yeah, so it's in black and white- so was Schindler's List, and parts of the Blair Witch Project. There are no phony special effects to make fun of, no stilted dialogue, and no bad acting. All in all, I give it a 9 (the only movie I've given a 10 to is Schindler's List). That's saying something from a person who tends to abhor old films.

Do not watch the remake: watch the original.",9
9 January 2015,Very Entertaining,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

13 April 2020,The film undoubtedly reflects many social realities,"The film undoubtedly reflects many social realities,ubiquitous prejudice and aggressiveness, and the cheap ""conscience"" that is always self-proclaimed. Near the end of the three people who still insisted on ""guilty"", two of them were cynical. The younger ones caused another juror from the slums to get angry. Complaint of the dirty and despicable of the lower classes. In today's society, many people with ""conscience"" and media with ""conscience"" are not doing such things? The facts are not important, what is important is ""conscience"". Even the jurors who do not have a clear position in the film are often willing to slam and condemn, and always show a righteous expression to show their ""conscience"", so they attack all moral trials. Have become reasonable.

Popular sentiment is always wave after wave. In reality, some media people have manipulated public opinion to interfere with justice and jeopardize fairness and justice. The basic principle of independent and fair justice is completely forgotten. As the protagonist in the film reprimands the number 3 juror-""a look for the way to heaven"". ""God"" doesn't care what you think, ""Do you think what you think is what you think""?",10

26 June 2021,"12 Bombs, Walking and Talking in a Single, hot as Hell, Room.","A legal drama movie can't be better than it. This Movie proves that you don't need a high budget, beautiful set- pieces, stunning action scenes, etc.

You just need a hot room with some angry men.

Sidney Lumet fantastically captures the emotions of the jurors and the great acting performances by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb makes us forget that there is nothing in this movie except 12 angry men and a hot jury room.

Don't be fooled by its time of release. It is still better than some of the greatest movies of today.

27 January 2018,A cinematic masterpiece that no movie enthusiast should miss out on,"Featuring 12 fascinating characters in the roles of jurors on a murder trial (hence the title) Henry Fonda plays the lone vote that urges the rest of the jury to think twice and reconsider the verdict of the defendant. While some may argue that this film is the best of all time, few will debate it's place in anyone's top ten list as it's masterful dialogue, riveting plot and virtually flawless direction will leave any filmmaker straining to beat. It's simplistic setting and costume design renders the film timeless and besides it's black and white visual it will certainly be able to captivate any audience that won't settle for anything less than a modern standard. If by some miracle you're a film enthusiast, filmmaker or even a casual viewer who has missed this phenomenal piece of work, I urge you to give it a watch as soon as you're able to.

4 July 2001,An excellently made courtroom drama,"I'm not a fan of old movies, but this film was very compelling and excellenly directed. Unlike other legal dramas, the entire film takes place in the juror room. The beginning of the movie starts out with the jurors leaving to deliberate, and a single shot of the man whose fate they have to decide on. I normally would have been bored with a film that takes place in a single setting, but the director does an incredible job of presenting the different characters, and brings a lot of personality to every one. The viewer begins to understand each of the jurors as the movie progresses, and their reasonings for their verdict.

The other great thing about this filmn, is that none of the facts of the case are presented in the court, and all of the knowledge the viewer has about the case come from the jurors. As they present their arguments, we begin to learn more about what might or might not have happened. At the end of the film, we still don't know what actually happened, which shows that the movie isn't about whether or not the man is guilty or not, but the reasoning and logic that produces the final verdict given by the jurors. The tension in the jury room is amazing and you find yourself siding with certain jurors, almost as if you were actually in the room.",10

22 July 2010,"great movie, but ...","I can't add much to the laudatory admiration for this movie -- I share it. A wonderful example of bare, minimal drama, based on plot and acting and characters. I think it was almost without exception a wonderfully performed movie -- Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman, all the jurors.

Here comes the only thing I think I disagree about with others who think as I do that this is a wonderful movie. I think they were wrong.

It may very well be an aside as to what the jurors were really talking about, but to me, it was very important. And Henry Fonda made, again to me, some pretty poor arguments that were to overcome the evidence that was pretty indicative that the boy did in fact kill his father.

Just as an objective look at the arguments being made, beyond the wonderful drama, the boy was guilty from all facts that were presented. Perhaps that may be the only flaw, but a fundamental one, in this very exceptional movie.",
5 March 2020,A PERFECT MOVIE,"Screw cinematography, special effects, soundtracks, big setting with amazing landscape shots. This movie is one of the greatest of all time and only because of dialog. Truly a movie in a league of its own. Each of the 12 jurors with big personalities and each has a moment to shine with making amazing points. This is in my opinion the best written movie I have ever seen.

11 November 2019,"Saw this when I was a young teen... loved it then, loved it now.","Old movies probably don't get the kind of respect that they should. There was a time when being an actor was more than just a sign you were wealthy, it was a sign you were talented as hell. The whole cast in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Between that and a great story, 12 angry men although made in 1957 is just as culturally relevant and important today as it was back then.

The story finds 12 nameless jurors(at least until the end anyway) deliberating over a boy who is supposedly guilty as hell over the murder of his own father. Suffice to say, almost all 12 men(remember, this was the 1950's) want to convict this boy. The lone holdout wants to go over the evidence a little more because something inside him says maybe it's worth it because they're deciding a boy's fate, and that it's not something to be so casual about.

The ensuing two hours of the film features some great twists, great turns, and remarkable humanity on display by all these wonderful actors, portraying very flawed but very relatable human beings. In the end, what really makes this movie works is that 12 men understood what responsibility truly means... so I guess this is kind of like Spiderman... times 12.

All jokes aside, 12 Angry Men is a classic and is worthy of being shown at film schools not just because it demonstrates compelling acting, great story, amazing emotion and even character growth... by most of the main cast. Show me a movie that has such a transformative narrative(Transformers doesn't count).",
20 October 2019,Great movie-Gives you food for thought,"I won't lie to you-when they told me this is a 1957 movie, I got scared. But this movie made me realize that, if a movie is genuinely good, it doesn't matter when it was filmed. If you have great actors, directing, and a great scenario like in this case, the least thing you need is advanced cameras and fancy effects. This movie really does make you think, and that's so important. It deserves its 5th place 's top rated movies, because it has an all time classic quality, since it promotes ideas that we are yet incapable of understanding. People need to watch this.

2 March 2017,Listening to those tummies growl makes me think they ought to be called 12 Hungry Men.,"This is a pretty good example of why execution will always matter more than any kind of extravagant production or over inflated budget. Anyone even remotely familiar with this film understands that it's just 12 guys in a room arguing over a trial. It's a concept so simple on a visual level that it could just as easily be a middle school stage production and you could probably still find much of the iconography which comprises the setting. Again though, none of that takes away from this film.

To begin with, this film couldn't have been shot better. Sidney Lumet's background in television allows him to take full advantage of shifting lenses and ensemble shots which give the film an escalating sense of tension that in indispensable in convincing the audience that the dialogue happening between these men is A) taking them a long time and B) is physically, mentally and emotionally taxing for them. It's pretty easy to imagine a more amateur director shooting this film in a more flat and repetitive way. Thankfully Lumet isn't an amateur. Every shot and cut is so purposeful in this film. Not a frame is wasted and the one room setting at no point becomes tiresome.

This film really reaches it's greatest heights with it's characters, despite how wonderful the visual narrative is. All 12 men are unique characters. None of them fades in to the background and they all bring a unique perspective to the case in question. You get a really good sense of the lives they lead outside the confines of this room they're in. At a certain point you get to have such a good understanding of the different men that whenever a knew point of debate is brought up you can start to piece together how each one of them is going to process it and how it might affect their ultimate decision on the case. It's really a bit of a difficult balancing act. In the end there are certain members of the jury which naturally have to take a more dominant role in the story than the others, but at the same time you have to allot the others time to bring depth to their character. Lumet and the actors put it all together flawlessly.

One you thing you might notice when watching this film is the general lack of music. I think ultimately it's better that way. In all likelihood music would have been more of a distraction than a tool in enhancing the tone of a given scene. There is music of course, but the reservation with which it is used ends up giving it more relevance to the story than if it book-ended every scene in the film. This film is in the dialogue and character interaction, and really there isn't enough room for any kind of over the top score, but again, that doesn't detract from the experience in any way.

Check it out if you haven't. It's great. 9/10.",9
14 August 2015,excellent,"Wow, just wow.A brilliant film set in the right tone, no unnecessary scenes or waste of time. It is is a simple plot that will ultimately blow your mind. I watched this film recently and it was difficult in the beginning to adjust to it as it is in black and white. But soon the movie just caught my attention and I completely forgot about it being in black and white.

A very well written script focusing on every detail and there is almost no sign of it being fictional. It is wonderful how the entire movie was set in just one room and doesn't bore the audience or one minute. The acting was phenomenal from everyone and they knew that the movie was going to be special in their career.

A must watch for everyone.

31 August 2011,Delight in black and white.,"Courtroom dramas don't work well with everyone. Neither do movies in black and white, people find them dull, boring and lack-lustre. 12 Angry Men falls in both these categories. Yet, it manages to astound you with its breathtaking brilliance and subtle perfection.

A boy is convicted of murdering his father. Witnesses, good lawyers, bad past record, motive; an open and shut case. Three minutes into the movie and the twelve jury members are in their chamber. They have all got their priorities and schedules - one has a baseball match, another has his garages going to pot. Everyone wants to leave; it is not their butt that is going to land on the electric chair anyway. Prior to a discussion of any sort, an initial vote is held with the hopes of making a quick, clean job out of it. Eleven are convinced he is guilty. One isn't quite so sure. And hence unfolds one of the greatest dramas Hollywood has ever seen.

The movie doesn't waste time in showing the lawyers fighting like shark. It doesn't show a depressed teenager sobbing his guts out in the box. The camera focuses on him but once, and that single look is enough to convey a farrago of emotions - fear, exhaustion, uncertainty and a certain innocence. Instead, it does what it is meant to - focus on the twelve men that matter; in whose hands resides the fate of the accused. They are regular people from everyday spheres of life - a coach, architect, bank clerk - men who don't overanalyze when presented with facts. They naively, yet innocuously, take things at their face value which compels them to reach the guilty verdict; after all, the evidence is overwhelming. The lone man (Henry Fonda) who contradicts them, however, realizes the onus that has befallen them and refuses to reach a hasty conclusion, for he believes that there is the possibility of there being reasonable doubt and as the American Constitution states, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Initially, the others are merely taken aback at the trivial inconvenience due to this rebellion of sorts. But this soon turns to resentment, finally boiling to anger - something that beautifully justifies the title of the movie.

Henry Fonda does a convincing job as juror number eight. He is brooding, intelligent, pragmatic and at the same time calm with a mild demeanour. His acting isn't artificial as he thoroughly indulges himself in his role. The performance is powerful and both the jury members and viewers find it hard to counter his arguments. He asserts that ratiocination is the best and only way to decide - for a man's life hangs in the balance. As the movie proceeds, you see him demolishing proofs one after the other, till they all collapse like a stack of cards. The others too play their part, however, there isn't a real standout among the remaining eleven; a shortcoming that the movie faces. The rest of the characters have been poorly portrayed and lack depth; there is nothing that stands out or is memorable about them. While the film had several chances to introduce more dimensions to its actors, it simply fails to do so, despite the fact that is it primarily a character-centric movie. Fonda is staunch in the lead role, but the faceless others serve no purpose than contradict him, sticking to him like leeches, without creating an identity of their own.

The tension has been skilfully built up - right from the weather (it is the hottest day of the year) to the claustrophobic environment where the entire episode takes place. The idiosyncrasies of men have been highlighted wonderfully; their feeble mindedness, their anxiety, dogmatism, their indecisiveness and their fury at being constantly opposed by men who change their votes like the flip of a coin. They reason out, fight, talk dirty and negotiate. Their faces glisten with sweat. They smoke. A weapon is brandished and a man resorts to violence. Men are prejudiced, for the accused comes from a poor society with a history of violence. Some even cite personal reasons for convicting the boy. There is racism, bigotry and impatience; but juror number eight refuses to budge, for he believes that the life of a man is worth more than that.

The director Sidney Lumet (Network, Dog Day Afternoon) knows that the movie isn't about the suspense and doesn't try to make it into one. It is about how the characters have been drawn out, each representing a dimension of human personality. Though, like many great movies, 12 Angry Men was a commercial failure, it is considered as a benchmark in American cinema. It is touching, mesmerising and provocative, and it does so much in a mere ninety six minutes, which indisputably makes it one of the greatest cult classics of all times.",10

22 February 2019,Brilliant direction and performances,"I saw 12 Angries for the 4th time last night. I knew every line and reaction and was still engrossed to the end. The are maybe a couple dozen movies I can say that about.

To be honest, I think some of the dialog and a couple of the plot points are weak, but Lumet's direction keeps the movie moving seamlessly forward. All the actors are good, with Ed Begley, EG Marshall and Henry Fonda particularly so. It is Lee J. Cobb, however, that stands out for me. So powerful yet nuanced. Near the end, after Cobb recounts ""every single"" reason he thinks the kid is guilty, John Fiedler says ""You said we could throw out all the other evidence"" Cobb's reaction of bewilderment and frustration rang so true I have a hard time believing he was acting.

A fun exercise is to figure out the juror you most identify with. For me it is Fonda. Thoughtful, respectful, balanced, and cautious. Sometimes to a fault.

29 December 2019,Great movie about people and guilty until proven innocent.,"This movie was made well before I was born, but the story couldn't be more relevant today. My takeaway from this movie is we all have our own influences based on our lives and sometimes we are way too quick to judge based on this. Even if the evidence is overwhelmingly against someone, they are still innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Something that seems to be drifting away here in the year 2019.

Overall, well made movie that makes you rethink how we in 2019 act.

11 May 2018,Best movie I ever saw.,"Minor spoilers ahead!

""12 Angry Men"" is a magnificent movie with great acting that provokes thought and makes you try to understand each person and their background.

You should know that from the ninety-six minutes of the movie, only three take place outside the humid jury room. So, there isn't any breathtaking action, at least not the conventional one. The film focuses on characterizing the personages, it does it by the character's speech but also their behaviour and manner of expression. The characters are diverse and their views seem amplified and more apparent than is usually the case. Their diversity and amplified views help in getting a clearer picture of each juryman's integrity and motives.

The discussion's subject could be interpreted as a moral dilemma. But in fact, it is not. There are clear court rules which are the foundation of the justice system and which everyone is expected to abide by, thus leaving court-defined morals unquestionable (for the jurymen) and permanent, as they should be. However, we see some characters consciously opposing the court rules and customs, furthermore, deliberately convicting a possibly innocent person because of their biases and prejudices.

Although the discussion gets heated at times (especially when Juror 3 is involved) it is handled adequately by the foreman and other, more composed jurors. What I like is when the vote becomes unanimous (in favour of acquittal) there is no mocking triumph, instead, Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) shows compassion towards Juror 3 helping him with his coat after he broke down, regretting his actions and remembering his ""lost"" son.

Sidney Lumet, Reginald Rose and Henry Fonda brilliantly show off many types of people and their prejudices. Some characters' backgrounds are more clear than others' but we see every man's role and motive, perhaps too clearly.

The movie is gripping and moving, provokes thought and illustrates personalities. It inspires you not to succumb to others' irresponsibility and to act for what you deem righteous.",
4 May 2012,Convenient or otherwise...,"This stagebound potboiler has a plot which is a matter of shooting fish in a barrel. Racism, to use the prime example, is used as an instance of a rush to judgment and then it's used to excuse a rush to the opposite judgment.

Still it's important to realize that this is entertainment. The equivalent of advocacy journalism, I admit, but no one denies that the creators of this entertainment have agendas. To the extent that the film affected me, it emphasized again in my mind how fallible our system of justice is. One should steer clear of it at all costs (The justice system, not the film).

And having said that, we've arrived at our system of justice through centuries of trial and error. And the advocacy system still seems superior to any previous arrangement.

But back to the film: it's respected because it's tightly plotted and exhibits impressive characterizations on the parts of several actors. I'm sorry that several characters are stereotypes when stereotyping itself is the 'crime' the jury (as opposed to the accused) is so guilty of. But the fact is that stereotyping is how messages are conveyed through the mass media, and it's a matter of whose stereotypes are being retailed. Rose & Lumet have their own, and they indeed add up to shooting fish in a barrel. (Immigrants=good, Nativist Americans=bad, etc.)

There's also an implication that with enough consideration, no one would ever be considered guilty of anything, especially if we consider extenuating circumstances. Separately, it's scary to consider that the lack of air conditioning in jury rooms led to a lot of hasty verdicts!

Finally, though, I can readily imagine how bracing this entertainment was in 1957. It was probably very much like a lightning bolt.",7
12 May 2020,Amazing,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",8

8 June 2008,Twelve talented men.,"This is the all-time classic presenting a microcosm of personality types quarantined together for jury duty.

Prejudices are revealed and shown for what they are, logic kings assumptions, consensus is fought for by the more cogently thinking members against the ""mob"" mentalities present and the verdict is something you'll have to watch the movie for, to find out.

Iconic Henry Fonda is the archetype of the mature, clear-thinker on the side of justice while the solid ""everyman"" actor Jack Klugman is the last of ""the twelve"" still living at present. Do yourself a favour and watch this film in his lifetime to be part of its living legend.

10 December 2004,It shows a lot,"Actually,I seldom saw movies produced by Hollywood before 1980's.So I draw some conclusions that American movies are simply action or sex movies with shocking pictures.My compatriots often laugh at them as no deep contents.But as I see some films which are not so popular in my country,they enlighten me a lot about America nowadays as well as before.

""12 Angry men"" doesn't begin with ferry scene,but very fascinating subsequently,it raises my blood pressure,and exits me very much.I have ever read about novels written by John Grisham such as ""the runaway jury""and know something about jury system,yet no concrete comprehension.I hold the marrow of America jury system that if there is no enough evidences to prove the suspect guilt,he is then innocent,even if there is a 11:1.

It's a pity I don't know the end of the story but I believe ""12 angry men"" is one of the best Hollywood works. I imagine its final result is like the Shawshank Redemption,which moves me and encourages me.

Another thing I'm still wondering is that why western people have involved in democracy for centuries and still have a strict law ;on the contrary,Chinese citizens are familiar with being ruled but not caring about the law.",10
24 January 2022,My scorecard (8.6 + Bonus),"Firstly you have to address the year this film was made, 1957. After that, you have to recognise how contemporary and current the themes debated in the film are.

It has it all: Racism, Anger, Prejudice, Calm, Rationality and many more.

And for sure has Purpose. Nice film.

_________________________________________________

My scorecard

In a range from 1 to 5, i'll give a value to each entry written below. The final mark will be the weighted sum of each fraction:

Subject (2.5) = 5/5 Development of the Subject (1.5) = 5/5 Direction/Screenplay (2) = 5/5 Attention (1) = 4/5 Recitation (1.5) = 5/5 Musical Score (0.5) = 3/5

Final Mark: 2.5x5/5 + 1.5x5/5 + 2x5/5 + 1x4/5 +1.5x5/5 + 0.5x3/5 = 8.6 + 0.5 Bonus: Old movie, still up-to-date with our society.

= 9.1 .",9
11 December 2009,Superb acting pulls you right in,"This is one of my all time favourite movies. The quality of acting is outstanding and this helps one become immersed in the story (despite it being black and white and shot, for the most part, in a single room).

The 1997 remake is actually a good film but the inevitable comparison with this one does it no favours. Both are, in my opinion, great showcases of character acting.

One other thing I particularly like about this 1957 film is the cinematography - it's very well shot and you can get a real sense of feeling enclosed in that jury room. This adds to the atmosphere of the film and I think deserves a special mention as it's often overlooked.

6 January 2010,Amazing film,"An amazing movie in every aspect, plot characters (actors), dialog, atmosphere, directing, and the list goes on.You, the viewer may be misled by the apparent simple, linear plot, but in fact it involves the whole specter of human behavior, and shows us the consequences of the humans damaged way of thinking.

Fortunately not all people are the same.Out of 12 people we may find one man who's able to turn the rest around, back on the tracks of justice and moral duty.

To put it simple, what do we obtain if we put 12 different men, and when i mean different, i mean different like fire/water, in the same room? We get an outstanding sample of how things really occur in the jurors chamber.It's not pleasant, not nice. Every character has it's own faulty impressions, it's own flaws, defects and those things have a direct importance in making a vital decision, a life and death one.Whether it's right or wrong, who cares?,justice won't prevail, never did, never will, there's no objectivity, everything comes to those 12 angry men.Well, seems like juror no8 has something to say about the failure of the USA justice system.It's a proof of character and civic duty to stand in front of 11 men pleading guilty, and say not guilty, ""like a pain in the ass"", like an obstacle in front of ""more important things to do"", like there is something more important than the life of a young man.

Maybe i'm naive, but i'd like to think we live in a fair world, even if the reality shows us something else, I admire and salute the presence of juror no8 in this classic, beautiful interpreted by Henry Fonda. Funny, how one man can make a difference, this is in fact the whole message, that a single man can turn things around, if he keeps his temper and shows character.We live in an unfair world, that's the inconvenient truth, the question is: what are those involved in the system, especially the jurors, going to do? Watch carefully and find out.

The budget is ridiculous, but what do you need money for, when you have Sydney Lumet? Big budgets don't guarantee success, 12 angry men is the proof. This one is more than just a movie, it's the truth we all know and do not say. Think that the same situation could happen again, if not already did, without Fonda being there to literally save the defendant, what then?

Very very impressed and overwhelmed by this movie.That is why I rate it a well deserved 10/10.",10
27 February 2018,A phenomenal ensemble tells one of the best cinematic stories of all time.,"This classic court-room chamber-piece is a true cinematic staple and for good reason. '12 Angry Men (1957)' is one of the most engaging and compelling films I've ever seen, while always remaining a restrained and compact piece that pushes pure storytelling genius to the forefront in every single scene. The long, immaculately framed and blocked takes allow each cast member to simultaneously stand out and blend together to create a phenomenal ensemble as the characters realistically try to circumnavigate the complicated social situation within which they are placed. It's amazing just how much pure drama can be squeezed from something that is almost universally considered a dull chore, that being jury duty, to the point where I was constantly riveted and wholly immersed within the narrative, while also appreciating the impeccable craft going on behind the scenes. It's truly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. 9/10

28 January 2003,Simple Yet Powerful; Movie-Making At Its Finest,"Modern movies have convinced us that if a movie doesn't have big budget special effects and lots of action it's not worth watching. If you want to be healed of that viewpoint, ""12 Angry Men"" is the tonic. Here we have the simplest of movies. Except for the opening and closing couple of minutes this entire movie is set in a jury room, as 12 men debate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. Is he guilty or not? Will he be executed or not? The 12 jurors debate the case. And that's it, basically. And it's powerful and fascinating and you won't take your eye off the screen from the moment it starts.

Henry Fonda put on an excellent (if, I thought, a little bit too preachy) performance as Juror Davis, the lone hold out as the movie starts, the vote being 11-1 in favour of guilty. Davis may not be convinced of the young man's innocence, but he sure isn't convinced of his guilt and he sets out to convince the others to give the kid a break. As good as Fonda was, though, Lee J. Cobb stole the show as Juror Number 3, an angry, hateful and vengeful man who lashes out at the ""bleeding hearts"" as they start to be convinced by Davis' arguments. An excellent supporting cast (including the likes of E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman among others) also put on wonderful performances.

I thought the movie was summed up perfectly at the very end. As Davis is leaving the courthouse, he's met by Juror McCardle (Joseph Sweeney). They introduce themselves to each other (they are the only two jurors named in the movie) and then go their separate ways. These twelve men who held the life of another man in their hands didn't have a clue who each other were and would probably never see each other again. But for this brief period of time they could hold us fixated, even if we didn't know who they were.

Movie-making at its finest.

8 April 2014,Great Classic,"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.

The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.

Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.

Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.

12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.

As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.

The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.",9
19 January 2022,Dedicated to Sidney Lumet. The star of world cinema. I. Mr. Lumet's Unfading Debut:,"Exactly fifty years ago, American director Sidney Lumet made his film debut with a court drama, 12 Angry Men. At that time, Lumet was thirty-three years old - the average age for any aspiring director, as a rule.

Lumet's debut received several nominations in national awards - ""Golden Globe"", ""Oscar"", but did not win in any. 1958 - the year of the ceremony of both awards - turned out to be unsuccessful for Lumet, nevertheless, for the rest of his life, Lumet delighted the audience with this unfading debut - which became the best.

23 June 2019,Very spectacular,"I enjoyed watching the movie a lot. The film is filmed in a small room where 12 men are discussing the murder of a young boy. While this issue is unimportant to all people and they want to end and return to their jobs, one man is trying to persuade others to be unimportant about the lives of an innocent person. The film wants to show that everything does not look as it seems. With a little bit of patience and thought we may get better results.

23 January 2023,12 Angry Men - Top-Notch Courtroom Drama,"Although not technically a courtroom drama (it takes place in the jury room), 12 Angry Men is among the best films ever made in this genre. There are several sterling performances; including Henry Fonda, Lee J Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Martin Balsam, and Jack Warden. This film is an acting ensemble's dream. One after the other, the actors get a chance to show either their hammy or understated styles, depending on how they approach their roles. These performances, however, are not really hammy in the least, because the writer and director have a iron-clad grasp on all of the dialogue you hear. Although I would rate this film highly within its own genre, I don't believe the film belongs in the top ten films of all time. That being said, it certainly would qualify for the top 250 in a lower rating.

7 June 2004,important landmark movie,"This is the famous courtroom drama starring Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam and Lee J Cobb which takes place largely in the jury room where the twelve men are discussing the likelihood of the young outsider having killed his father. Of the dozen passing judgement, only Fonda has initial doubts, acting as the voice of conscience and coercion to change the minds of his fellow jurors.

The film is rightly famous for its tight structure, economical script, and claustrophobic acting. Perhaps Cobb's character is too extreme and more than a bit clichéd, but the types present around the table are well-drawn and convincing. Prejudices tumble out and coincidences jostle to turn the initial premise completely on its head. It is significant that on this hot day there are such a group of hotheads confined in one place.

A remake forty years later was of some interest but this is the superior piece of the two. A gripping play, done with economy.",6

3 January 2020,Film Review: 12 Angry Men,"Well done, director! 12 Angry Men is a superb courtroom drama, the sort of thing that turns your mind into a rubix cube. It is about the jury, and their road to deciding whether a teenager is guilty or not guilty. As it is in black and white, I cannot see any blood and I doubt there is any. Swearing is a rare occasion, and sex is a no-go. You can practically watch 12 Angry Men with a baby in the room. 12 Angry Men is superb. It is a film that can bring music to somebody's ears (no not literally.) This film is amazing, so I highly reccomend it. 10/10.

14 September 2013,"Really Clever and Realistic Script,","12 Angry Men is a unbelievably inspired film with a really well developed storyline and beautiful acting from all twelve men.The movie is literally an hour and a half of twelve members of a jury discussing if a man is guilty or not,it dosen't sound that exciting,but all these characters different personalities and opinions on this man come together so well that its made really enjoyable and intense,the conversations these men have get very deep and they look at every aspect of the night of the murder.I really didn't think it sounded that good but I wanted to watch it since it is so high up on the IMDb Top 250,and rightfully so,there is no movie quite like this one,its really unique.I would highly recommend 12 Angry Men to all moviegoers.

A jury of twelve very different men discuss if a man is guilty or not for a murder,but their different opinions make it into a much longer discussion than they expected.

19 May 2017,"At 20 years old, this is the best film I've seen so far","Everything about this film is amazing. My friend and I watched it together, at the end of it we didn't talk for over an hour. Our minds were so entranced with what we just watched that we didn't want our talking to ruin it. The film as you may know mainly takes place in one room, but oh man does this film keep you intrigued throughout. The characters had real depth to them, even with little information provided we understood who everyone was, and the kind of personality they harbor. I really was kept on the edge of my seat when they're deliberating, and the ending was absolutely perfect. This is a case study on WHAT to do if you want to make an effective film, without effects or actual violence or conflict outside of talking. Just amazing, and a must watch!

15 June 2013,Black and White Glory!!,"This is arguably one of the best movies ever made! no big budget, no explosions, no action of course. and almost full movie takes place in a room only with 12 men.

the plot revolves around 12 jurors deciding a fate of a young boy accused of murder and i don't want to spoil it for u. as the movie paces on in first half, u get to know the different characters of 12 men, the plot is thrilling and makes you at the edge of your seat. all of the 12 actors, their performances are really strong. u will find it hard to root for which one! :)

no matter after 50 years,u still can watch it again, it hardly gets boring. Real Timeless Classic.

19 March 2012,Simple but fantastic; it's old age is irrelevant,"The concept of this film is incredibly simple, as are the sets throughout. However, this is why the fact that this film is over 50 years old, is completely irrelevant to how enjoyable it is today.

Despite of the fact that this is not an action film, it is engaging, exciting and tense from start to finish and manages to stay highly entertaining throughout in the most subtle, intelligent manner I've seen in cinema.

This is achieved through absolutely fantastic characterisation; each of the 12 men the movie centres around are individuals who are void of any tedious stereotypes that most of the shallow characters we see in cinema today will fit into. Every one of these characters are complex, controversial and interesting. This is contributed to hugely by the fact that each and every role taken in this film is acted tremendously; it would be unfair to highlight a single great performance as every member of the cast is just sensational.

In addition to this, the script gives an authenticity and realism to the movie; we can relate to and believe every situation on-screen, which is what makes this such edge-of-seat stuff. Furthermore, the film could not be paced any more perfectly; as a result, the running time flies by.

Although this is, undoubtedly, a necessary watch for anybody, I could not give it a 10/10 purely because I felt that the direction of the plot and the nature of some aspects of character changes were a bit too predictable; I had a pretty good idea what was going to be different from the beginning of the movie and the end.

Overall, I believe that the unrivalled characterisation and simplistic thrills of this incredibly authentic, intelligent movie, render it a must-watch. ""12 Angry Men"" is NOT a victim of it's age... Just give it a go.",9
12 April 2006,Best jury movie ever,"A Hispanic teen is accused of killing his father. Tweleve jurors are sequestered to decide the kid's fate. The jurors take a vote before beginning deliberations and all but one vote guilty. So begins this highly engrossing drama based on a play. Directing his first feature film, Lumet does a fantastic job of building the tension, with virtually all the action taking place inside a steamy jury room. As the calming voice of reason, Fonda leads a great cast, a motley crew of jurors composed of characters from all walks of life: the meek (Fieldler), the hothead (Cobb), the thoughtful old man (Sweeney), the poor (Klugman), the disinterested (Webber). We get to know each juror over the course of the movie as Fonda makes the case for a reasonable doubt. Not to be missed.

8 November 2019,Excellent movie that still holds up 60 years later,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it.

13 November 2000,Best Film of all time??,"12 Angry Men is one of those black and white classics, It's a great film With Henry Fonda,(Meteor) and Lee J. Cobb(The Exorcist) It's about a court case, in which a boy was accused of murder after he killed his father. Then the Jury, the twelve angry men, have to decide his sentence, Be is he Guilty or not Guilty. There's questions all through the film about whether if he did it or not. You want to know if he was Guilty or not? Well then watch the film, you may think its some old black and white dribble, but its more than that!

5 January 2003,A well judged drama,"Lumet's courthouse drama wears its liberal heart on its sleeve. But there's some courage too in setting the action entirely after the trial is over: we see only the deliberations of the jury, trying to make sense of the evidence. In comparison to more modern (and histrionic) attempts to anatomise the legal process (such as the absurd Murder One), the merits of this judgment shine through: less really is more. The ensemble cast is excellent, and all the characterisations are well-conceived and executed, with considerably more depth than is common in films from this era. The only real failing is that the plot goes nowhere that you don't expect it to; but that's a flaw of many films far worse than this.

25 October 2019,It shouldn't be as engaging as it is. But it is.,"A movie that is basically one long conversation which would normally be a bad idea but it's a conversation that is had every day and the outcome determines the life or death of a person.

I was cynical about this picture. Often people swoon over a movie just because it's conscientious and has a good message at the expense of actually having an engaging or intelligent plot.

Well I would say we do have a plot in a very meaningful way. While we have so many dramas on TV about cops catching lawbreakers, this movie tries to depict something unlikely, a person doing something the digital age knows more than any is a hard thing to do: change someone's mind.

There really isn't a dull moment. All the factors and the variables from the actual logistics of the crime itself to fiercely well thought through and convincing examination of our numerous kind of biases (from racism to something actually even more haunting) all come together in what is nothing short of a feat of writing. I've never seen anything like it. It loses no power for its age, it only gains it in face.

Every character is rich, three dimensional and plays with amazing competence. The performances keeps it visually interesting but they somehow managed to give a cinematic feel with their cramped location without going overboard.

I'd recommend it even to people who don't like movies made before 1964.",8
13 November 2010,A cerebral experience,"This movie proves that a good story and a tight script are more important than any other thing for a movie to succeed. Sidney Lumet was already experienced when he directed this movie but still 12 Angry Men is an amazing first film. Henry Fonda is the main dissenter from the jury who tries to convince others that the case is not as simple as it appears. Joseph Sweeney who plays the role of the old man also does a remarkable job. The movie proves that a defendant has the right to a fair trial regardless of his social or economic status. I wish this movie could be shown in every law school so that lawyers and judges can understand the gravity and importance of their decisions. The movie is more than 50 years old but still feels fresh and is also a must watch for anyone who loves good cinema and for people interested in film making. This is also a perfect example of a simple yet powerful movie that will stay in the minds of the audiences. I can bet that anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget it easily.

16 July 2023,Simple can be great,"I can't believe I was hooked for every second of such a simple movie. I didn't know what to expect going into the film, I just knew it is always on top of the rankings of the best movies of all time. I was pleasantly surprised that a movie with no action at all, no mind-bending plot, and what could seem like a very boring setting, could have me so invested and on the edge of my seat. The film flows perfectly and makes you feel as if you are there, like you are Juror #13 trying to come up with arguments to convince everyone else. One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets. It makes you realize how easily can people, who have nothing to win or lose, go over important details when there's a lot at stake. A true classic.",8

20 May 2012,"With a simple idea, Inspired me in many ways.","Twelve angry men was built with a simple idea and was developed entirely attractive during the show till the end. Needed no many rooms and sets and even the casts didn't have their own name. I watched this film in the midnight and for a long-conversation movie, it didn't make me drowsy at all. I follow the story well and attracted to find it till the end.

It may be a drama movie but the crime story catch me a lot. The way the director presented the development of the story is top of the class. The story flows constantly. Every details was included neatly. I had my eyes all over the room every time the camera move around and I tried to find errors such as misplaced sets after different take, bad expression from the walking around jurors or anything. But, I couldn't find any. Every part of it looked natural and I admired it. Splendid.

Its story shows us how impact and self-influence is not only about power and authority. Look how Henry Fonda in this movie influenced the other 11 jurors and made them all agree with him. That's fascinating. This movie teaches us that in order to influence others or to make people listen to us, we have to listen first and then speak with noble way and rationally accepted argument. This is a very perfect portrait to be presented in an Influence-Training seminar.

There are so many valuable thoughts inserted here and inspired me in so many ways. A lot of things such as humanity, leadership, courteousness, manner etc. I've already added this movie in my favorite list. If you haven't watched it, make sure you'll do.",10

26 December 2016,It's Just Great,"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.

(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)

The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.

I do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time.",10

9 March 2015,12 Angry Men : A great film which must be watched by anybody interested in learning more about the legal system.,"Although this film by American director Sidney Lumet is called ""12 Angry Men"",it portrays much more than mere anger of 12 men whose services are required as jurors to decide the fate of a young boy accused of parricide.Everything starts for these men at a leisurely pace as a vast majority is convinced that the young boy is guilty of killing his father.However,it is at later stages that one discovers that not enough attention had been paid by these men in order to carefully study certain key facts which indicate that a lot of inconsistencies were found in what was expressed by the witnesses.It is said that a defense lawyer's negligence can send an innocent convict to gallows.In the same manner,an intelligent juror with clever arguments can help an innocent victim escape punishment.This is depicted in the form of actor Henry Fonda's character whose labored reasoning outwits unreasonable arguments given by other jurors.These arguments do not come alone as they enable other jurors to somewhat get rid of their prejudices.This is one key lesson one learns from watching this film which suggests that finding the truth in a court of law is no laughing matter.",10

14 May 2021,"""12 Angry men"" is an English movie about 12 jury, placing their arguments for a murder case judgement.","Duration: 1h 36min Category: Crime, Drama Release date: 10 April 1957 Country: (USA)

The movie starts with the bench of 12 jury, who were in court and after a hearing they gathered together.

About a murder case, one teenager boy accused to be in a judgement & when he was sentenced to his pentalty, the jury board met . Those 12 jury were in a secret room that is for jury, are in discussion if the boy is guilty or not.

The murder case is about a teenager boy who was accused to murder of his own father. A women, who was the eyewitness, lives in the next house of the murder given witness against the boy and said she had seen to the boy to kill his father.

After getting entered to the jury room, on the voting among the 12 jury, 11 out of 12 voted for the boy to ""guilty"" except one. They were aggressive to him about the difference of opinion as on the society used to do.

But the exceptional jury, placed his argument to his collegues and after that another jury convinced to the vote and changed his opinion.

Gradually the vote is increased on the side of ""not-guilty"".

At the end of the discussion, they started to think as same as the murderer. They played some acts.

At last 4 men were on the side of ""guilty"". But the first man who was on the ""not-guilty"" side, convinced those all of the men and they started to know more about it instead of giving their opinion.

As we can see, the main characters are those 12 jury and their discussion is the main theme of the movie.",10
7 January 2022,Portrait of intense drama,"This is a memorable piece of work, dealing with in a sense at heart a simple premise: Guilty or not guilty, in a case where a boy is questioned over possible murder.

4 January 2015,One of those classic black and white films that has to be seen!,"12 Angry Men is a film that deals with a number of issues including racism, justice, and standing up for what we believe is right. The acting is amazing and the story is even a better.

The main conflict is the decision 12 men must make about the fate of a young African American man who has been accused of murdering his father in cold blood with a knife. It seems to be quite obvious to the majority of the jurors that the kid is guilty, except for one man. When the men vote on the guilt of the buy, it is 11 guilty, 1 not guilty.

As the film moves forward, we see the one man (juror #8) fight as hard as he can for what he believes to be right.

18 February 2023,My favorite film of all time,"This is a movie I could watch every day without growing tired of it. Every word spoken holds your attention. No franchise film, or action flick, or war movie, or romance, or drama, or ANYTHING ELSE captivates the way that small-scale, single-set, script-focused films do oh-so-naturally. And the benchmark for such films is 12 Angry Men, a timeless classic about one man standing alone to prevent a grave injustice. A boy is accused of murdering his father. The defense attorney was utterly disinterested, so the prosecutor's case appeared clean-cut. When 11 jurors quickly move to convict without a second thought, one juror (Henry Fonda) decides to vote for acquittal just to ensure the accused got a fair shot.

This is an eloquent, cerebral film that stands peerless in its field.

27 May 2010,A movie that gives a perfect example of multiple aspects of human nature.,"I won't say that this is ""The Best Movie Of All Time"" because there is no such thing as ""The Best Movie Of All Time"" but this movie is definitely one of the greatest and my personal favorite of all time. I won't point out how well this movie was directed or how well this movie was written or how well actors acted in this movie because in case of this movie and some handful of other movies talking or arguing about these things doesn't matter. Some movies are not just about entertainment, some movies are beyond than just entertaining, some movies are something more than just entertainment and surely this movie is one of them.

This movie is a perfect example of multiple aspects of human nature. This movie gives a perfect example of justice. This movie shows how reliable justice is and why justice is not always justice. This movie gives an idea about why world issues doesn't solve and not only an idea about issues of today's world but world issues from any age.

This movie has a huge influence in my life.",10
18 July 2005,Courtroom tour-de-force,"Classic study of the psychology of a jury in a murder trial. Exciting movie with a great cast, including Henry Fonda who also produced the film, Lee J. Cobb (perhaps his best performance ever?) and Martin Balsam as the weak but earnest chairman. But they are all great. John Fiedler as a perplexed juror, E.G.Marshall as the somewhat reserved man with the glasses, Ed Begley who plays the bigot and off course Jack Warden as the working class guy who just want to get it over with so he can go and watch a baseball game. Although the characters in some cases are somewhat on the brink of being caricatures, the movie is so nerve-racking and you get so involved ín the drama and tension of the questions involving right or wrong, good or bad, true or false, that you are just compelled to the max with this film. There is simply no better way to make a movie about a murder trial!

19 May 2019,Timeless Masterpiece!,"This, my friends! Is a film that is in my top favorites of my favorite films of all. I find it to be one of the best dialogue films ever because the film has no action to make it intense, it is the words that all of the 12 jurors speak to each other, especially with Henry Fonda that has to convince all the other jurors that the kid wasn't guilty and it is amazing how it is done in the film with an amazing script, dialogue and performances. I highly recommend it! It maybe a talking movie, but I promise you will not be bored one bit! Go see it!

22 March 2021,This movie talks the talk and walks the walk. 9/10,"This is 90+ minutes of nothing but dialogues and conversation in connection of the plot - where twelve jury members gets to unanimously decide whether a death sentence should be applied in a case, or not.

That's it. That's the whole plot. It literally only takes place in the one and same place. I just got to be a fly on the wall for the jury procedure.

This movie ended up leaving a lasting impression on me. It's about as close as I can get to a movie that leaves a life-changing impression with me for the rest of my life.

12 Angry Men is a gripping drama about the logical, as much as it's about the illogical. It's about reasoning, as much as it's about unreasoning. It's as much as giving the benefit of doubt to someone, as much as it's about not doing so.

This movie talks the talk, and walks the walk. 9/10",9
9 January 2003,12 Excellent Performances,"Fonda tried his only attempt at producing with this tense, claustrophobic drama. Though the film was initially not very successful and Fonda did not recoup enough money to draw a salary for it, it was a work close to his heart and has since gained an almost legendary status (only slightly dimmed by the endless mediocre stage versions that pop up everywhere from high schools to church basements.) The story concerns the deliberation of twelve jury members in the case of a Puerto Rican youth accused of knifing his father to death. Fonda picked each of the other jurors from among the best actors that New York City and Hollywood had to offer. Some went on to greater fame. A few are virtually unknown today, but all do a fine job in the film. As the film gets under way, the jurors take a vote which tallies 11 guilty and 1 not guilty (Fonda.) He must attempt to sway the remaining jurors to his viewpoint or risk a hung jury. Each of the jurors fits a certain ""type"". Some are meek, some loud, some wealthy, some poor, some ethnic, etc... Scoring especially well (though their high volume bombast can be rough on the ears at times) are Cobb, Begley and Warden. However, the quieter ones are no less effective. Marshall is excellent as a carefully behaved upper crust man. Webber is at his most handsome as a snappy ad exec. Fonda underplays his role, allowing the audience to project its feelings onto his familiar face. There is a lot of the expected discussion and rehashing of the evidence, but the film is also punctuated with a few piercing dramatic moments and somehow manages to create and build suspense in a story where there isn't a lot of doubt as to the outcome. The film captures a sort of old world class and respect and dignity (even with the underbelly of life that gets exposed in the story) that is mostly absent from today's movies and today's world. Whenever a man gets agitated, someone politely suggests that he calms down and typically, he does. Today there would have to be a fistfight and all sorts of extra melodrama to keep audiences watching. However, for the patient and appreciative viewer, this film satisfies greatly. An interesting point is made at the end....that after all the deliberation and drama, the jurors never even knew each others' names and from here on will likely never see one another again. It's a thought-provoking and intriguing story with lots to offer. Should be required viewing for anyone about to sit on jury duty as it illustrates the dangers of preconception and going with the flow.",
14 December 2019,One of the great all star movies,"On paper it seems dull, 12 men in a jury room deciding the fate of a defendant.

13 May 2004,A classic!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal.

23 January 2021,12 Good Men And True.,"Perhaps few films are a credit to Television, Stage and Film as well as 12 Angry Men.

A masterpiece of screenwriting, this is and should be required viewing for all students of cinematography, screenwriting and acting.

Many words have been written about the writing, direction, and acting and I doubt I can expand on any of that material, other than to underscore the already glowing respect this film has earned over the years.

At its heart this is a peculiarly American Film.

While the presentation of an all White Male Jury seems dated in today's eyes, it was on key when it was written in the early 1950's urban America. This is the story of social and economic poverty, violence, racism, cultural divides, and crime. It is also a story of doubt, fairness, intellect, heart, and as Lincoln noted, it is about ""...the better Angels of our nature...."".

Twelve ordinary Men, who normally would have little to do with each other, or exist in each others orbits, are required to make a judgement on the life or death of a young 18 year old man-boy

The fact that this is twelve middle and upper middle class White Men judging a Porto Rican Teenager is a ""quiet"" racism that is an undertone throughout this film.

As in many times in its history the idea of what it means to ""be"" an American, and what direct is the future of America, is at play here, the Porto Rican boy is the future, the now is an urban scene of poverty, immigrants, crime, street gangs, and violence.

To the men who are in this court, this is just one more newspaper article and one more example of American urban life ( read White Male American life ) eroding by forces they feel are beyond their grasp, and yet here is an apparent cut-and-dried crime they feel is understandable and something they can do something about.

It is a film about the wonderful part of America, the part that is its true difference, not its strength, not is power, not its culture, but instead it is a film about a system of laws and governance where the ability of people to understand each other, and themselves, can take place, and where one individual can make a difference for the good of everyone.",10
16 July 2008,A tour-de-force in group dynamics,"This film is highly recommended for anyone interested in group dynamics. The 12 characters are not caricatures: their complex motivations and thought processes are skilfully played out in an very dramatic--and yet highly plausible--plot, and this is certainly no mean feat. Analyzing this film can provide hours of fascination.

The formidable cast gives virtuoso performances, particularly from Peter Fonda, Lee Cobb, and E.J. Marshall. The exchanges that take place in this small room--giving the feel more of a stage play than a movie--will stay with the viewer for many years. This film clearly deserves its current (July 2008) rank of 11 on IMDb's Top 250 List. The later remake does not do it justice--this is undoubtedly the version to watch.

1 July 2002,Gets everything right that matters,"Here's an illustration of the difference between theatre and cinema. This is the definitive cinematic ""performance"" of Reginald Rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever. On the stage, they WOULD be of consequence. As E.G. Marshall performs the role, Juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really IS all that bright). And Henry Fonda tends to play Juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason). THE two key performances, in short, are weak. On stage this would be fatal. On the other hand, with STRONG performances all round, ""12 Angry Men"" on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of ""Don Giovanni"" can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day Darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed.

If you exclude Ed Wood movies and the like, ""12 Angry Men"" was shot with as much economy as any other film in history, with roughly HALF of the exposed footage making it into the final cut (I find this hard to believe, too, but it's what the director says, and it's not inherently impossible). No doubt accounts for the odd touch of unpolished acting here and there. What's amazing is how perfectly Lumet has paced the action, how RIGHT each shot is.

Lumet conveys the confined space all the more effectively by including thirty seconds, perhaps a minute of footage of the outside: the opening shot where we track into the jury room, and the closing shot in the open air outside. These moments - which established there was a wider world while cutting the jury room off from it - were crucial.",9

17 October 2015,When the Oscars went wrong and Berlin got it right,"Second viewing. Another example of a Berlin Golden Bear Winner, nominated for 3 major Oscars and not winning a single one. ""The Thin Red Line,"" won the Golden Bear and was nominated for 7 Oscars. It suffered the same fate. History proves the big winners of the big three European film festivals are considered true gems of cinema over time.

Just wondered at the parallels between this film and Kurosawa's ""Stray Dog"" (1949). The oppressive heat and the eventual rain that affect the characters are the same. Wonder if the screenplay writer had seen the Japanese film made 8 years before the Hollywood classic.

Another debut film that proves to be the best work of a director over time.

22 June 2007,A testament to the proprieties of law,"12 Angry Men does not obfuscate its theme with superficial clash-and-bang, chill instilling spoofs which leave viewers tremulous after the feature like sweet chocs leave children appeased yet inevitably desirous of more. Exploitation of special effects and the plethora of augments which bog Hollywood main-stream projections leaving the essence of the plot line non-existent or heavily in question is not exercised in Sidney Lumet's sublime and profound production. 12 Angry Men plays spontaneously in accordance with the nuances of a dozen jurors who have, placed before them, a case which involves powerful yet questionable evidence against a young man who presumably murders his father. Eleven of the jurors find the testimonials of the only two alleged witnesses incontrovertible while one dares to differ and hence through impartiality and a strive to revivify the loose pieces of evidence which feebly serve to incriminate the accused, bolsters the rest of the reluctant jurors to spend several hours of self-sacrificed time for arriving at the most logical conclusion. The performances in the film are starkly genuine and each actor fits his respective role like a glove. No other film of it's classical era and genre may best serve to enlighten, entertain and stupefy you than this internationally loved and strongly enduring saga of courage, recalcitrance and what it means to indulge a reasonable doubt in a situation of life and death.",10

13 October 2008,too dated,"The film 12 Angry Men might have been very good cinema for 1957, but in the 21st century it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

The movie wears you down while characters spend more time bickering about bickering than actually going over testimony and evidence. It's like the Blair Witch Project, where the characters act loud and annoying, beating the audience into exhaustion. The characters in 12 Angry Men mostly argue with each other, often screaming, making the resolution more gratifying to the audience. It's a common trick.

*begin spoiler alert* Maybe we've gotten spoiled watching too much Monk and CSI and Law & Order, but as a legal drama the movie is confusing anyway. There's no discussion of blood trails or spatters. The defendant claimed there was a hole in his pants, but no pants were reviewed as evidence. Davis introduced a knife he bought as evidence in the jury room, which you can't do. The jury determined that the witness was nearsighted based on her nose. The jury decided a witness was incapable of running based on how he walked. The jury never discussed who else might have committed the murder. The thought-process behind the plot is so convoluted, it makes the whole movie frustrating to watch. *end spoiler alert*

The movie is OK for 11 year olds so certainly carries a lot of nostalgic value 60 year olds, but it's flawed and doesn't hold up as a timeless film.",7

We share the little victories of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) as he manages to logically deconstruct the other jurors' fallacies and personal prejudices, and rallies them over to his side one by one. A beautiful film that remains relevant and gripping decades on.

But this one clearly made me realise my mistakes that beauty lies in the screenplay and the essence and soul of the movie. It is a timeless classic. Don't miss this just because it is an old movie.

24 July 2023,It's a classic for a reason.,"I regret waiting such a long time to give it another good watch, as I saw it once when I was way too young to fully appreciate the masterpiece it is. It's incredible that a movie made over 75 years ago is still very relevant today (sadly) in the many themes it touches: our justice system, bigotry and prejudice, personal interests over what is right, etc. Even the dialogue doesn't feel like that of an ""old movie"" and I was fully engaged from beginning to end. The acting is absolutely on point, as are the directing and pacing. There are a lot of so called classics I honestly think did not stand the test of time but this isn't one of them. Highly, highly recommended!

The lives of the 12 jurors are encapsulated in their views, prejudices, thoughts and actions. The movie had a lot of strong feelings shown with no strong language. It shows what good writing, acting and directing can do to show people's feelings without resorting to vile language. It showed as much anger as was necessary and not a trace of R rating language was necessary.

13 May 2019,12 Angry Men and How Logic Beats Prejudice,"A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.

Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.

This is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life. This film tells us that must be a logical explanation for everything, despite all of the prejudice that appears in the whole case. The script success to make us think whether the boy is guilty or not and makes the intensity of the movie felt so real.",10

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
29 June 2022,The Best Legal Drama Ever Made! An Absolute Masterpiece!,"""12 Angry Men"" (1957) marks the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, and features a great lead performance by Henry Fonda, and an outstanding supporting cast, including Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and E. G. Marshall, based on an earlier teleplay by Reginald Rose.

The 12 Angry Men referenced in the title are the twelve jurors of a murder trial who are tasked with the civic duty of deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18-year-old young man, accused of murdering his father.

The film takes place almost entirely in the jury deliberation room, and while that may sound as entertaining as watching paint dry, the film has a claustrophobic sense of tension that permeates every single frame, and it is an essential and searing look into the American justice system that is still startlingly relevant over 60 years after it's initial release.

It's quite simply the best legal drama ever made, and an absolute masterpiece of a film, that serves as a masterclass of small-budget filmmaking (it cost only $337,000 to make in 1957) and features one of the most profound and powerful individual scenes ever captured on film!

Everybody should watch this film, at least once in their lives. It's just THAT good, and THAT important!",10
29 December 2022,A nice jury drama,"This is the first movie I watched which was a court drama from jury's point of view. The movie starts slow but with time it becomes intense and you get grabbed into the story. The case is discussed in such a way that you will also keep thinking about the case and will feel that you are also involved in the discussion. The screenplay and direction was done nicely. It feels little loose in some scenes but overall it was good. The performances by the actors was normal, nothing special in that. It was the story and it's execution which makes this movie thrilling to watch.

Overall, it was a good movie which you should give a try.

27 December 2020,"Acted out in class, forever memorable...","Performed this play in 7th grade and absolutely loved it (thank you Mr. March)! All I can really recall is the basic plot, but nevertheless I vividly remember how this film made me feel deep inside.

This is a rare film that encourages you to dive deep into yourself and be introspective. Every step the movie takes forces you to reevaluate and adjust your judgement of rationality. The 12 characters enable the person behind the screen the ability to be a part of the learning process that is cultivated by Juror #8, and it is done flawlessly.

Did you know that in the movie, they incrementally demolished the walls and moved them in to create more tension? It's such a small detail that I had not noticed prior to someone telling me about it, but its effect is REAL.

10/10 for its influence and outstanding execution.",10
22 May 2000,What an excellent film!,"It seems as you grow older, you can appreciate older films more. That does not mean that when I hit the age of 65 I will appreciate a film like Citizen Kane, but now that I am in my late 20's I have a desire to see some of the greats from years past. Just five years ago I was too narrow minded to want to even try to appreciate older cinema and some of the screen greats. But today I rented the 1957 classic, 12 ANGRY MEN and was not only pleasantly surprised, but I truly liked it and thought it to be quite a good film.

What's quite fascinating is to see the change in political and social climates since the days of black and white film. In this film, there were no black jury members, no women, and no swearing. This was also, to be fair, probably the worst handled case in the history of trials next to the Warren Report. Questions that today would be common place were avoided like the plague. Evidence was not handled properly, very little effort was put forth by the defense to come up with a defense at all and witnesses were never thoroughly interrogated or cross examined to refute what can only be regarded as flimsy testimony. But, not only was I not around in the 50's, I have no idea what the North American justice system was like back then, and perhaps that is what makes this film so interesting. So I can only say that it is possible that a case could be handled this poorly, given its circumstances. You would have to compare and dissect what society was like back then to get a true appreciation of what was and wasn't possible.

To talk about the film, yes it was very enjoyable. It was a great film that unwound piece by piece all of the apparent infallible theories that pointed to the guilt of this kid. The writer should be given a lot of credit for that. But having said that, a film like this would never see the light of day with today's fickle audience that would rather see a film like Con Air than High Fidelity. I am not critisizing today's audience for that, just pointing it out. But the 40's and 50's were different. Spielberg and Lucas and Don Simpson and Joel Silver were just little tykes then. It was a different time. A film that only talks and has no action was perhaps a possible sell back then with a cast like this. Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda and Jack Warden must have been at the height of their popularity so that immediately leant credence and respect to the project. But it wouldn't matter who did this film in today's age, it would not work. Again, not a critisism, just an opinion.

I think it is important to go back to the roots of cinema every once in a while to view some of it. You come across gems like this and you learn to appreciate them. 12 ANGRY MEN is a fascinating film and it is one that serious lovers of film should watch every now and again to feel the aesthetic of film before special effects started to replace a good script and a good director. Tarantino would appreciate something like this. In his version of 12 ANGRY MEN, the 12 jurors would probably have names of colours and at the end they would all have grabbed Henry Fonda's knife and tried to kill each while uttering the F-Word in, but a film that prides itself on dialogue more than action is what he is all about. This could be a pioneer of a Tarantino film project.

12 ANGRY MEN is a great film and it is one that HENRY FONDA should have been proud of. A wonderful experience! And it is great to see some of his work, other than On GOLDEN POND.

26 July 2022,Before Judging Please See 12 Angry Men Movie,"In my opinion, Before you judging someone or something, please see this movie and Learn how to judge. There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups.

7 September 2020,This movie is just perfect,"When you watch this for the first time, you probably will think it's a very dull movie in the beginning, mostly because they are only talking. But if you give it a chance you will see it's a perfect movie.

I have never seen such a great movie where there is only one location, no action, no weird plots, just those 12 men and the case. This is a cinematic masterpiece!

28 September 2022,Absorbing Men in a Tight Space,"12 Angry Men is a solid and very entertaining drama confined to a small one room set, with tight camera angles, which adds to the claustrophobic feel so necessary to the films success. The characters are broadly drawn and a bit one dimensional, in particular Fonda's role. Looking beyond that though it does take the viewer on an interesting journey of these 12 jurors of what was supposed to be an 'open and shut' case to one that seems like it might never come to a conclusion. Despite the broadly written characters. All of the performances are well done and come together to create a highly entertaining film that is definitely worth checking out.

13 April 2006,Middle aged angst,"12 jurors decide the fate of an 18 year old accused of murder who faces the chair. As the title implies there is tension and anger aplenty in the jurors room as the all-male cast goes at it including Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. A great cast and great script directed by Sydney Lumet in his first film. Lumet would go on to have a string of hit films in the 60's and 70's including The Pawn Broker, Fail Safe, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Network but has been fairly inconsistent since. Lumet certainly knows how to get the best of his cast when he has great actors to work with and 12 Angry Men must have required some strenuous rehearsals. A remarkable screenplay from television writer Reginald Rose who had originally written this for television in 1954. Like the film Marty that had also been a 1953 teleplay that was adapted to the big screen in 1955 by it's writer Paddy Chayefsky, Rose does the film screenplay based on his television teleplay. This was only the second film that Rose wrote a screenplay for and he would only do a handful of movie screenplays in his career which was mostly television work. Polish-born cinematographer Boris Kaufman who was a veteran of Russian, French, Canadian and American films does the photography here. It was nominated for three Academy Awards including including major awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay but amazingly no nominations for any of the ensemble cast. Fonda, did win a Bafta and Jussi Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe and Cobb also got a Golden Globe nomination as supporting actor but the large cast must have canceled each other out when it came to nominations for the Oscars and all the other various industry awards. Passionate, gripping, intense, compelling drama. It's obviously dated with it's all-white, all-male jury and may be a little too heavily centered on the jury room with not much room for anything else but it's great character development and holds up well. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9
5 August 2021,Masterpiece!!,"Never in my life i would have thought that a movie about 12 men taking to each other for 90 min would be so engaging. The movie starts as we see 12 unknown people in a room with different personalities and opinions....and in the end we know everything about them. Their story, character and the way they see the case they were handed.....just couldn't believe we know almost everything about those guys and everything about the story in just 90 minutes....man this movie was a treat.... Loved It!!

23 April 2004,"""This isn't a game!""","Excellent if dated examination of personal prejudices, selfishness, hesitance, past mistakes, and responsibility when lone juror Henry Fonda tries to get his fellow jurors to take the time to talk about the trial a little more before condemning a boy accused of murdering his father to death by vote of ""guilty"".

Remade as a TV movie starring the late Jack Lemmon (in the Fonda role), the late George C. Scott (in the Lee J. Cobb role) and Tony Danza as the guy who just wants to go to the ball game. The TV movie had a few modern updates such as making the jury more ethnically balanced, a Hispanic guy on trial and a lady judge (Mary McDonnell of ""Dances With Wolves""). The prejudice examined in the remake was more racial, where as the prejudice of the original film had more to do with where a kid was raised and how the young and the old differ.

Both are great, however, with a hot, stuffy atmosphere that'll make you sweat even in the middle of winter. Fonda delivers one of his best performances as the one juror who's taken into consideration the fact that they have another human being's life in their hands and is unhappy with how the trial was handled. The other angry men are good as well, but Lee J. Cobb stands out in particular as the stubborn one who condemns the suspect not so much because he thinks he's guilty but more from his own failed attempt to raise his own son.",

21 February 1999,"No fancy sets, no special effects, just great acting","You have to wonder if the contemporary movies we enjoy today would not be so enjoyable if they did not have any special effects. Not that such movies are bad in and of themselves, but lately the trend seems to be to err on the side of dazzling high tech illusions rather than on the side of good acting. Twelve Angry Men shows that there is no substitute for good acting.

As viewers, we're not being asked to solve a murder case here. The focus is on the jurors, their personalities, prejudices and conflicts with each other while they deliberate. The actors were so convincing in their roles I often associated some of the characters with people I have known.

27 January 2006,"Twelve great actors, one superlative director, one gifted cinematographer, one hell of a movie!","So much has already been said about this magnificent movie by IMDb reviewers but I would like to make one other plaudit, the creative synchronization of camera, script, and music that intensifies the drama almost to the breaking point. The outstanding acting by a handpicked cast has already been noted. Not one of the twelve gave a mediocre performance. It would be hard to say which one was best. Even the ones with the fewest lines shine as few Thespians can on the big screen.

Oscar-winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman focuses in on the heart of what director Sidney Lumet and writer Reginald Rose are attempting to convey to the audience through the brilliant acting of all concerned. Watch as the jurors vote to make it six to six. The camera hones in for just the right lighting, facial expression, and angle to show the anguish and torment in the souls of these twelve angry men. It flashes to the key juror #8 (Henry Fonda) from time to time at just the right moment for the full effect of his deep conviction that the eighteen year old should have a fair consideration of all the evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of killing his father. The use of shade and shadow, especially when the thunder storm crackles outside is used to show the tempest that rages inside the jury room. The heat that eventually makes even juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) sweat complements the heat of the arguments and debates that sizzle throughout the room.

All this is simultaneous with a musical score by Kenyon Hopkins that matches mood to action in a perfect blend of all essential elements making this one of the best Hollywood films ever.",10

As the film progresses, the room becomes more claustrophobic and tense, which enhances the gravity of the situation. At its core, the message of ""innocent until proven guilty"" echoes strong throughout.

While outdated in many respects and not as flashy or exciting as modern cinema, 12 Angry Men benefits from clear direction and brilliant execution.

1 December 2003,Masterpiece,"Virtually the entire film takes place within the jurors room. This just goes to prove that you don't need special effects to make a film gripping. A good dialogue and a superb performances make the 90 minutes fairly zip along. The case is an open and shut case, but is it ? The best courtroom drama ever made even though strictly speaking it isn't in the courtroom. The characters don't have names, but jurors 3,4 and 10 are the real hard nuts. Lee J Cobb is outstanding as juror 3 and Henry Fonda gambles and wins as juror 8.

10 November 2012,Deserves to be in the top 10,"What powerful and hard-hitting cinema! There is so much said and conveyed directly and indirectly within a mere 96 odd minutes! I, for one, was neither ready for nor expectant of such a treat when I started watching ""12 Angry Men"". But boy, did it hold my attention within that short span!

Let me be frank with you. These days I am on a Top-250-movie watching spree. But half of these so-called masterpieces are just packaged trash- packaged either with drugs, sex, homosexuality, underworld, etc. Barring these, there is not much to boast of in most of these movies. I watched Raging Bull and just could not make head or tail of it. I mean, I being an avid movie-watcher, had there been anything excellent about the movie, it would have made itself obvious. Also my expectations for the movie were rather too high. But I just could not bring myself to like this movie. But 12 Angry Men indeed means business when it comes to story, performances and meaning! The focus is entirely on the jury of a murder trial and whether the accused does deserve a benefit of doubt in a previously thought open-and-shut case. As one man is unconvinced of the accused boy's guilt, he elicits his reasons and calls for a discussion. I must mention that character-etching at this point of the movie becomes very important and the movie does excel in this particular requirement. Each of the jurors have a distinctive personality and their own prejudices or indifference. Nothing is forced to churn out a performance, each character dons his role comfortably. There is the leader of the group who drives the discussion smoothly, there is a shy, polite timid person who must always respectfully address others even when angry but still speak out his mind, there is the man who is convinced of the boy's guilt out of personal prejudice, there is the loudmouth old guy who belittles certain people, there are the rational men like the man who was raised in a slum, the painter and others, and there is the man who has no interest whatsoever in the matter. And there is Henry Fonda as the man who is the voice of reason in the entire jury.

The storytelling is riveting and at the end of it, I was yearning for more. A simple but outstanding movie! Move over The Godfather, Pulp Fiction- I rate this one higher in all counts of movie-making...",10
29 March 1999,Gritty juryroom drama,"Based on the stageplay of the same title, this is a taut drama that takes place mainly in the closed-in confines of a juryroom. The cast is superior. Each juror reveals something about himself and human nature, thus making the juryroom a microcosm of human psychology.

1 June 2004,Absolutely brilliant,"I have never been on a jury so I don't know what is really like, but this film is great look into that situation. The tension, the stress, the heat, the cold, the nerves are all rivetingly put on screen here with some truly fantastic camera work.

What is more fantastic is that the action takes places basically in one room and the camera seems to be free floating capturing all the vital action. Every face, every expression, every twitch, and is just ingenious.

The acting is also amazing. Cobb and Fonda are particularly good as the two ends of the jury's decision whether a man is innocent or guilty of murder. This is an absolutely brilliant film that no one should miss. 10/10

16 January 2022,The script is the movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
12 August 2012,Tremendous Film,"12 Angry Men is a tremendous film, worthy of repeat viewing. If you are a fan of courtroom drama's, then this will definitely be to your liking. It is not set in the courtroom itself, but rather the film deals with the jury, and it's attempts to reach a verdict in the trial they've been assigned.

Henry Fonda plays the part of a juror who does not necessarily dissent at first. He simply feels that the other 11 jurors ought to talk for a few minutes about the trial. What builds from his few initial questions forms the basis for all the tension that comes later.

The entire film is shot in only two rooms, a large deliberation room and a bathroom. I believe there are a few exterior shots at the beginning, and there are a few at the end, outside the courthouse. There is little of anything to work with here in the way of props and settings, so you know that the acting must be excellent in order to hold everybody's attention for over an hour and a half. It is.",10
23 May 2005,Effective and gripping,"It takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times, or at the very least, knows the outcome of the story. Sidney Lumet's 1957 film ""12 Angry Men"" fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when I watched it again last night, I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film.

The story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. The boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by Henry Fonda. At first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. Because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man.

The brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" can be explained in three parts. First time director Sidney Lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. The setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the United States. But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension: He makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. He also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort.

Secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. Not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. There is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly ""sees the light""  every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. In other words, no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort.

Finally, ""12 Angry Men"" features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Henry Fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. He doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say ""I don't know."" His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. The antithesis of Fonda's character is Lee J. Cobb's juror. He is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors.

There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film ""12 Angry Men"", a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list (I believe it was #20 the last time I looked), which is extremely encouraging to me. When the movie going public is rating films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy over films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Citizen Kane"", it is great to see that a ""small"" movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition. ""12 Angry Men"" definitely holds a place on my short list of ""Films I Think Everyone Should See"" because I think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice, not from a lawmakers standpoint, but from the perspective of public in general. 9/10 --Shelly",9
1 May 2020,"A masterpiece, pure performance","The entire dilemma of the movie seems to be very simple to solve, but the movie embodies the spirit of what it means to ""be responsible with our decisions."" A deep touch to the common citizen who only watches over his time without consider how much a simple conjecture means for the rest of the people.

That just blew my mind away, You wont want to even blink for a second while watching this movie, the screenplay is so gripping . Apart from the step by step revelations of the case , we also get a good look at different characters personalities . Each of them has their own reasons for believing/ not believeing the boys guilt .

Please do watch this Classic.

30 December 2021,Ensemble Cast in the Truest Sense,"Most films featuring ensemble casts include up to a handful of 'main characters', alongside a slew of secondary characters that never receive very thorough characterization. I was stunned at how deep and fleshed out every single one of the 12 jurors was in 12 Angry Men. Apart from Henry Fonda, the arguable lead man in the dissenting Juror #8, every character shares the screen equally.

Fighting to dominate the screen might be better phrasing than 'sharing' the screen. This is 12 powerhouse performances, ensuring that there isn't a moment's lull despite being filmed almost exclusively in one claustrophobic deliberation room. The powerfully acted, incredibly written jurors will leave their personalities imprinted in your mind long after the relatively brief runtime is up.

27 September 2010,Beyond Perfection........,"Recently, i read the biography of Henry Fonda named as ""Fonda My Life"" inside which all the events and aspects associated with his life (both personal and professional) were highlighted. He started his career as a stage actor and gradually became one of the most matured actors of Hollywood at that time.

12 angry men is undoubtedly one of the major milestones of his career. his biography as a source i came to know that 12 angry men was the only film that he produced in his entire film career. Due to the disappointing performance of the movie at the box office Fonda decided never to produce a movie again. but this film was critically well acclaimed and after watching the movie i understood why is it so....

if you wanna ask for my personal opinion about this film then i only want to say that _ if you want to learn how to make a low budget masterpiece then there are numerous lessons that you can come across after watching this film.

yes, some people may say that this film is more than 50 years old (black & white, of course) and will not match up with the expected standards of the new generation. But it is a fact that 'Old is gold' and 12 angry men is a classic example of it. staying consistently at IMDb top 10 list is not a child's play. watch this film and you will come to know how much powerful it is.....",10
14 April 2001,What a great film this is,"Everybody should see this movie. I first saw it in my 12th grade law class (that was more than 10 years ago) and I just finished watch it again. Fantastic! I think it truly shows us what a great debate can do to the understanding of a case. It's justice at its best. We all have prejudices that we must try to put away when making a decision like these men have to make. Why not try to apply this decision making system in our daily life. Maybe then, we would live in a better world.

You can feel the tension in that room. First of all, almost all of the action is in the jury room. It's also almost in real time, so you can follow exactly what happen in the hour and half that the men spend in that room. Another thing, it's the hottest day of the summer and the fan isn't working until almost at the end.

I find also interesting that these men, at the end of the movie, know a lot about each other, but they don't even know each other's name. That's why jury #8 asks jury # 7 his name when exiting the court building at the end.

Truly a classic to be watch by everybody.

Out of 100, I gave it 89. (That's one of my 25 best movies ever seen)",10
11 June 2020,Cinema on its pure state,"This movie proves that to us that a great story doesn't need the best effects or the best filming on earth to be actually good. How is this possible that a movie located in one single room is that superb? Many of the best actings i've ever seen and an amazing hit to a time were it seems to be normal sending a man to death.

1 July 2017,Great Movie,"12 Angry Men is a great movie. It is an incredible legal drama that really explores the concept of guilty beyond reasonable doubt. It has a great script using many different individual characters with different personalities and backgrounds. Sidney Lumet did a great job directing. The use of having characters sitting, getting up, pacing, reenact into, and other movement. The use of camera angles and light. It has a great ensemble cast that all did equally great job. 12 Angry Men is one of the all time great movies. It ties with Network as Sidney Lumets greatest work. It also is one of Henry Fonda's best performances. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is absolutely brilliant. A true classic everyone should see.

21 January 2003,12 Angry Men make one happy viewer!,"While the term masterpiece is often bandied about capriciously, in the case of director Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men the word can be most aptly applied. It is absolutely marvelous to behold the layers of twelve distinctly different men peel away to reveal their fundamental cores as they fulfill their civic duty as jurors who must decide on the fate of a young man accused of murder. The characterization and interaction of the twelve men will fascinate any viewer who enjoys films that explore the triumphs and failings of the human condition. Intriguing premise, perfect casting, intelligent dialogue, and superb direction all make me give 12 Angry Men the the highest possible recommendation. 10/10. Go see it now if you haven't already! 12 Angry Men is a truly unforgettable film experience!!

7 February 2015,Oh man! The court cases!,"From this film everything we watched later involving court cases derives. What I meant by this, after so many people watched they demanded films to be created showing court and court cases over and over again. Even because of that, later real court cases were televised like OJ Simpson case. Even Roman Polanski was offered to return to the USA for his always incomplete pedophilia case, but he refused. Only rarely people distinguish between film set and real life, and he Mr. Polanski is one of them at least I presume.

If you did not watch this film yet it is a must see for you, there is no escape! You might be selected for a jury one day! YOU! And you might want to wish to get some blood.

19 September 2006,old fashioned drama juggernauts light up the screen with dialogue,"This film's budget must have been miniscule, but nevertheless it is more interesting to look at and listen to than 98% of movies out there! The personalities in this film represent a microcosm of American, and the attitudes contained therein. There are leaders, skeptics, ignorant ones, and those who care about justice and the American way. This film is a celebration of the American justice system. This is a film where the story is capture by great dialogue and great monlogues. The shots that capture the subtle emotions and movements of the characters are magnificent. No over-pretentious or over melodramatic ending, but a satisfying one nonetheless. Here the American Justice system is put to the test and the patience of 12 angry men is put on trial on one of the hottest days of the year...

12 February 2023,An Outstanding Legal-Drama,"This film essentially begins with a jury being sequestered in a room in order to render a verdict on an 18-year-old defendant charged with premeditated murder. To that effect, since a guilty verdict would result in the death penalty, a unanimous decision is required. That being said, it stands to reason that each of the jurors would want to make sure that their verdict was the right one. However, because the evidence strongly suggests his guilt, some jurors become highly indignant when one particular person known only as ""Juror #8"" (Henry Fonda) expresses doubts--and it's then that some people show their true colors. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is probably one of the best legal-dramas that has ever been produced due in large part to the gripping plot and the number of outstanding actors also cast with Lee J. Cobb (as ""Juror #3) and E. G. Marshall (""Juror #4"") standing out the most, in my opinion. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film, and I recommend it to those viewers who are looking for a legal-drama of this sort.

14 October 2001,EXCELLENT...no other word for it,"I rarely give a film a '10.' But, this film with absolutely no weak spots deserved it. Everything works. All of the actors are great. The film has a darkness to it, a quiet gray sense of hopelessness, as boring as a New York summer day, hot, humid and dark. The weariness fades as the various members of the jury reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the plot unfolds and the wave of change sparked by new awareness begins to sweep the dreary juryroom. The jurymen begin to lose their apathy, antipathy and conflicted, convoluted attitudes. As the action goes on, each man must confront himself, his own values and his own fears, prejudices and weaknesses. The ending is a triumph for all of us. Reginald Rose not only put together a flawless thriller but look at that cast. Not a cull in the bunch. Several went on to establish themselves as character actors, e.g., John Fiedler, Robert Webber, Edward Binns, George Voscovec and Joseph Sweeney. Some others were already stars in their own right, Ed Begly Jr., Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and others, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall and Martin Balsam went on to achieve stardom in films and TV. All were veteran character actors who add a ring of credulity to their roles. Rarely, indeed, only in a great once in a while, does it all come together as is does in this film.",10
23 May 2020,Magnificent Movie,"Yep this movie is so great. The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

How a film should be made. Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10",10

25 February 2022,"Excellent Film, but No Masterpiece (as it's often touted)","I don't agree with the lavish praises and rating for this excellent film.

Yes, the acting is on point, but largely by imposing characterizations on predisposed personalities.

Here's my breakdown:

STORY: The story takes the common courtroom drama and moves into the jury room, where the real trial occurs.

This was a bold move to essentially do a one-room film, and it was done so successfully.

But I don't see the story itself as exceptional. Did it push the bounds of the Civil Rights movement?

Perhaps. But remember, these actors (as all do) returned to their opulent lives, e.g. Fonda, and continued on.

So trying to convey Fonda, or his ""quiet strength,"" as some moral high ground is a veneer. This story is not any great testament to democracy or civil rights.

A far, far more telling story would be ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" or ""In the Heat of the Night."" These are far more sweeping stories as to racism, injustice, and the mountainous strain it places on oppressed peoples.

ACTING: Yes, it's an all-star cast. But I don't see any of them moving outside their normal personalities. This is why I say these were easy characterizations wrapped around existing personalities, e.g. Cobb, Fonda, et al.

TEMPO: The pace is perfect for the subject, but younger viewers might get bored

CINEMATOGRAPHY: Not much to say - it's a room

DIRECTING / WRITING: Lumet was not the hero that many tout him as. This film and ""Fail Safe"" are excellent films, but aside from these he directed almost entirely TV crap. Ditto on the writer as well ... not much depth and near pure TV hack.

I'll grant them this was an excellent work together, but otherwise I don't see great talent.

Is it a very good film? Yes.

Should you watch this once? Yes.

Rating 7.7.",8
19 January 2021,not one of the top 250 movies,"I don't see reason why this would be one of top 250 movies. Definitely, I've seen much better many more ones. The only reason this deserves at least some rating is because it is good for such old times for which I have less expectations, because it shows something serious like how a lies can affect somebody's life and destiny, and because it teaches us some law terms. But the actors, location, events are so boring, nothing to see. Talk dominates, and more like political ones. Maybe good only for law lovers, workers, students who love it or learn about it or it is their career.

9 July 2018,The best courtroom drama in history so far.,"I choose this movie as my first review because this is the best movie I have ever seen. Just to elaborate this is not my favourite movie of all time but the best Drama of all time. Yes its highly male dominated which can be a bit off putting for feminists. But if you aren't looking for romance, action but pure drama and superb acting this is the movie for you. I would also suggest this movie for people involved in legal and paralegal services. Cheers.

20 February 2020,Reasonable doubt,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
18 May 2004,Decent copy of the last half of Kurosawa's Ikiru.,"I really enjoyed this film, but watching Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of the best films I've ever seen, kind of ruined it for me. Basically, the entire film seems to be borrowed material. In the second half of Ikiru, a group of individuals argue back and forth about the intentions of a character who passes away. In 12 Angry Men, the jury argues about the guilt in a case. It's not the same situation, but it's basically the same type of storytelling. The problem is that the second half of Ikiru is so much better than 12 Angry Men, I was kind of left wondering what is so great about 12 Angry Men in the first place. I'd recommend seeing 12 Angry Men first if you haven't seen Ikiru, because it simply can't compare to Kurosawa's masterpiece. Good, but it is unquestionably outclassed by Ikiru.

I'd give 12 Angry Men about a 7.5 to 8/10, but I'd recommend you also see the far better Ikiru, easily a high 10/10.

19 April 2004,Jon Monsarrat review: Better than Runaway Jury,"I've seen plenty of classics, and I have to tell you, a lot of them have aged. But 12 Angry Men stands the test of time.

I saw this film for a class in business school, believe it or not, as an example of communication and negotiation. Throughout the film, the main character uses various ways of building rapport, convincing people, and debate. It's really astonishing.

The film does a good job of setting up personalities quickly, using generic characterizations that make it easy to follow all of the 12 characters. Unlike Runaway Jury there isn't a lot of action, but there's plenty of tension and this action film junkie found it to be accessible and very engaging.

Who should see this film:

-- Everyone who has an interest in classics.

-- People who are curious about classics but want to avoid the boring ones. Take a chance on this film.

12 Angry Men still packs a punch; I'll give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10
4 March 2023,No rest for the righteous,"For an hour and a half, we're stuck in an airless room with a dozen irritable guys, yet that 90 minutes is practically a roller coaster. That's not just impressive, it's a work of art. 12 Angry Men boasts a fine cast but it's especially powerful thanks to excellent writing and direction. It's kind of a foregone conclusion that Henry Fonda will eventually turn his eleven peers, but man, is that an uphill battle; everything from impatience to go home and personal prejudices stand in his way. At several points, I found myself hanging on every word, and if there's one thing you can really feel in this movie, it's the collective weariness.

Bottom line, this is an all-too-relevant courtroom thriller that deserves every bit of critical praise. Amazing movie.

4 August 2008,A Classic!,"I actually learned a bit more about what it's like to be a jury from this movie. I've only seen this movie twice and they were both for a school project. I had to read the book and watch the movie, I was assigned jurors, although I got the ones who don't talk very much. It was pretty fun to do it twice. I do love to watch TruTV, I learned a lot what it takes to convict somebody, especially in a murder case. It be nice if there was a job to be a juror full time, instead of asking random people to do it, and they don't even get paid that much either to be a juror. To anybody who likes to watch crime or cop shows, this is a true movie for you!

31 January 2006,Absolutely Brilliant!,"This film couldn't BE any better. I watch it over and over and I never get tired of it.

This film got a bucket-load of Oscar nominations but none for acting. Why? Because it's THAT hard to isolate one great performance. They were ALL great.

Every role had something in it worth watching.

As of today (Feb. 2006) only the two Jacks (Klugman & Warden) are still with us.

This film deserves to be in a time capsule. It proves that a great story will carry a film the distance.

20 June 2009,Unbelievable,"I can't believe it!This movie belongs to the 50's.IT'S 53 years old!! And still,it is a huge success.We don't have this kind of movies any more.I don't even think there is any other movie like this one.It's one of those movies that makes you wonder.I've seen a few movies of this kind.This one made me think about the fact that many young people(including myself,until I saw this movie)think the movies older than the 90's are pieces of crap.Well,some of them are.But many aren't.And this is the best example.

It's black and white.It all happens in one room(or whatever,most of it).But that's what makes it so good.

See it.It really is one of the best in history

25 August 2016,They have twelve scraps of paper... Twelve chances to kill!,"The premise for this film is fairly straightforward. Twelve men are elected to sit on a jury of a murder trial for a young boy who is accused of killing his father. Almost the entire film is centred in one room, where the men, if they unanimously vote that the young boy is guilty then he is sentenced to death. Initially, the vote is guilty, 11-1 Reasonable doubt is called into question and the men must discuss their reasons for their votes.

I particularly liked this film as the situation is something that is very believable. One of the first reasons that the men give is 'he just looked guilty' due to the boy being from the slum areas, another is a man has his own personal reasons for his vote. I've always had a personal belief that jury duty is an odd premise. It seems strange that a number of complete strangers are able to determine the fate of another human without their own personal background being known. For example, someone gets accused of domestic abuse. Several of the jurors are unfortunate enough to have also had a history of domestic abuse in their life, either on the giving or receiving end - their judgement is going to be clouded by their own experiences and they are not going to be impartial to the accused. I suppose the issue is, what is the alternative then to strangers on a jury in these cases? It also doesn't seem right that one judge should be responsible for making this decision.

The acting in this film isn't the best I've ever seen. Some of the characters over emphasise their lines and their character portrayal, but the 'main' juror, Henry Fonda, is wonderful. His character is deep, sympathetic and a real interest to watch on the screen. This is the first film I've ever seen with him in it, but it hopefully won't be the last as I go delving for more. Lee J. Cobb is another one of the main characters, and plays a very different part to Henry Fonda. His character is unlikeable, loud, brash and rude - and you're meant to hate him, and you truly do! The ending is slightly predictable, but you're not sure how they're going to get there which continues to make the movie enjoyable.",9
19 January 2022,"Talk, talk amd talk","This a movie that EVERYBODY should watch, re-watch, and learn from it!

There are two more versions, both good, but this is a masterpiece. The whole set-up, camera moves and caption, dialogue, characters development are on the highest level. And the most important, all this shaming and blaming without reasonable doubt that happens this times...watch and learn.

4 November 2018,Best film ever made,"When I saw it for a couple of years ago I was totally in it and my first thought was that I hadn't seen such a well made film ever. This is still my thought! If movies were food this would be the Nobel dinner. Allthough it all happens in one room the movie through it's so fascinating. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the person who makes it a little bit tough for the rest of the jury in the courtroom. The film makes you wanna think about justice in our society. It is a very important film and you have to see it

22 May 2015,Such a classic film.,"The power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic.

The story to 12 Angry Men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way.

12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and I think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 Angry Men paid off brilliantly.

The acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.

Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.

The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.

For problems with the movie: I don't have any.

Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time.",10
9 September 1999,"The Angry, and why I'm not.","A great film. I've only even seen parts at different times. I always meant to sit down and watch the whole thing, but too much to do lately, I work. Luckily, AMC is showing it often, so maybe I'll see the whole thing.

But for now - here are my thoughts: Henry Fonda is superb - did the kid really do it? I still don't know. But the character actor suppport is audacious! Everyone is in there - Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Sr., Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marhshall, what more can we want in black and white? That's when the camera operators show their greatness.

I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.

I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats. Not one to touch them these days.

Curiously, though - I like the new Drew Barrymore. She's become a woman.

Carol Young Foley Just my picks.",
11 July 1999,Outstanding,"On a hot, summer day in New York, twelve jurors mull over the fate of a young boy on trial. Eleven jurors vote guilty, but only one votes not guilty. Through methodical, and meticulous attention to the details, Henry Fonda starts to sway each juror, one by one. Not many films around that can have an entire movie take place in one room. Sidney Lumet packs the powder keg and slowly turns up the heat. You'll find yourself glued to the screen, waiting to see if Henry Fonda can sway the jury.

18 June 2001,12 men make one great movie,"A young man is convicted of stabbing his father to death and after the trial it is up to the jury to decide his fate. 11 vote guilty, but juror number 8 has his doubts as to the absolute certainty of the conviction. Now it is a case of the lone juror to preside his view of the case to the other eleven who rushed into the idea of his total guilt. The acting here is what makes the movie work, especially by lead Fonda and Cobb in memorable performances. It is easy to get caught up in this gripping film and basically see how different men interact in when caught up in such a situation. Rating, 10 out of 10.

23 May 2023,"A very well made film, with great actors.","As a non-American myself, it's a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works. Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option.

So to understand this movie better, I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works. And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest. Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass? Throughout the film, it is quite clear that the trial did not go well, mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused (something difficult to admit, especially in a case of capital punishment). Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence? I confess, I don't know. I leave this to the jurists, lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject.

The film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema: the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment, quite confined, and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue. Dialogues are an essential part of the film, and they are not always nice. It is noted that there is an increase in tensions, and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving, this changes little by little, as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase. It is a frankly well-written, well-directed film (Sidney Lumet's best) and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role, giving us one of the best works of his career. Also, Lee J. Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts, in a deeply caustic character. Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job, and they all did.

On a technical level, it is an extremely discreet film, largely due to the low budget it was limited to. However, it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job. The setting is very believable, but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort. Sometimes, the camera gets so close to the actors' faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves.",10

I don't like a lot of old movies because I feel like they have to overcome the tech limitations but this movie is amazing. I do however feel that people who like a shallow movie for some good simple fun will not like this movie. It is very deep and could be too slow for some people. If you like to hear stories you will love this, but if you need constant action I am not sure this is a good fit.

17 June 2006,It all hung on the actors' skill,"12 men in a jury room: no women in 1957, of course. Fonda played it great, as did the screenwriter: no pressure, just let them come to their own conclusions. Put enough pressure on the bastards, so they show their asses and then the nice guys will see the light and change their verdict.

Loved that they showed the equivocator and the one who wanted to get to the ball game, so he voted not guilty .....but were also shown up for what they were. The prejudiced guy making his bigoted pitch, with all the folks standing up and turning their backs: obviously, this was not Birmingham jury. When you look at the lynchers who were acquitted by all-white juries, you know that Henry Fonda couldn't have made a damn with them.

When I was attacked on the Boston Red Line by a drunken thug who took my Peace sign and jammed me in the stomach with it, then ignored by the MBTA police on the platform, I knew how it must feel to be a black man in 1950s Alabama and try to get justice.

When we went to Quincy court, the cops all circled round the guy and read his girlfriend's testimony to the clerk. It wasn't even carried over to the D.A. When I objected that the testimony presented wasn't even mine, the clerk said, ""It doesn't have to be. You may be the victim but you're only a witness as far as the state is concerned. And the cop could use anyone's testimony."" But the impression was that it was MY testimony, not the thug's girlfriend's.

So this was an idealization of justice moving along toward the correct verdict. . The jury foreman was key: if he had been dictatorial, it would never have gotten to the point of free exchange. Because he was passive, Fonda was able to take over. I doubt that this was at all realistic. THat's why they choose jurors without college educations: so the ignorant can be swayed by the lawyers. These jurors were evenly divided, with the less well educated being the more ethical, interestingly enough. Lee J Cobb, as the father of the estranged son, and the last holdout, did a magnificent job as a bitter angry man, who would have liked to send the kid to the chair out of his own anger. Fonda was great as the Jesus figure. Too bad he couldn't have brought a little more of that to his daughter, Jane. The weather also starred in this movie: the heat added to the pressure. When Fonda helps the various jurors open or shut the windows, he also subconsciously makes them his allies in his fight for truth. The screenwriter did well to keep him neutral. He doesn't know if the kid did it: he just wants them to discuss the situation before they kill him. In the course of the discussion, the jurors actually create a trial that didn't exist.

Interesting legal question: can you judge a man by the inferences you draw from what may or may not have been said at the trial? In other words, is it 'legal' to use means other than what the defense did to acquit the defendant? A trick that wasn't used: no body died. I thought for sure the old guy or the angry guy would have a heart attack in the heat, and they would have to bring in one of the alternates, adding to the character study. Great movie. I""m sure when I see it again, I'll find even more in it. But I did love how the Casper Milquetoasts were empowered to find their own voices.

Easy to see why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The writer was magnificent and i don't even remember his name.!!!!! Fonda without a good script would be Paris Hilton.",10

15 February 2023,Three for the Acting,"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself.",3
3 September 2012,An Unexpected Surprise,"It as been a while, that I wanted to see this movie, but I never was brave enough to see it, since it is a 90 minute movie, where the movie it's all concentrated on a 12 men deliberation. Otherwise, this movie actually surprised my ideas, indeed.

This movie is surprisingly brilliant, it is very simple but wonderful at the same time, it just shows how can a simple movie without any special effects can be turn to a real masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing, specially Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb which made this film even more incredible, thanks to their powerful performances. The characters are impressive, there is a wonderful job on that department, all jury's are different from each other, in personality and class terms, which in my opinion made a very good character extension. The dialog was genius, very original and creative. Filmography was beautiful, the camera focusing the juror's faces was really impressive with the black and white picture as well. What also impressed me was the impact that this all discussion between the 12 men can make a perfect impression of our society of today, even though this film was made in 1957.

This is really an outstanding classic movie, which is really worth to see, and that I really wasn't expecting for its marvelous success.",9

30 June 2007,Gripping and powerful,"Simply astounding. It's incredible that basically just a one-scene movie could be so gripping and involving, but the fantastic script and terrific acting make it so. I'm glad they didn't show a re-enactment of the crime, or definitively say whether the kid was innocent or not, as the film's not really about the crime at all. It could be the best character study ever told, even though we know none of the character's names until the end (and then only two of them) nor what they're like outside of the jury room. The only weak spot I found among the ensemble was Juror #2, I just found him incredibly irritating and was surprised the other jurors - especially #3 - didn't rage at him at all. It's kinda idealistic, but still one of the greatest films ever.

28 February 2007,A masterpiece of stylized realism,"It has been said over and over again that it is a classic and I have no doubt about it. Movie grips you from the very moment when one of the jurors disagrees with all others. 11 out of 12 are convinced that the poor fellow guilty but one has a reasonable doubt and here starts a drama full of turns, conflicts (ethical, personal and logical). He starts with nothing but sharing his thought over the issue and needs to discuss a little further and what happens next is intense, compelling and above all logical. One thing which strikes me most is the level of responsibility when everyone else has different thought. It is a best example of how to raise you in the time of tension.

Everything I mean everything in the movie is perfect, dialogs, direction, script and above all acting.

A must watch for all.

26 September 2000,Lumet Masterpiece,"Probably Lumet's best picture. The film is not about story, it's about 12 characters, 12 very different people deliberating a straight-forward murder case, but as the picture goes on, things are not clear cut.

The film features 12 fantastic characters, each one is different, each one has different reasons for their answers. Henry Fonda is brilliant, maybe not his best role, but still fantastic.

Lumet's direction is not gimmicky. The director puts us in the film, you are part of this jury, we are number 13.

The film is shot in black and white, perfect photography.

I can't say too much, just watch it because it's a masterpiece derived from a simple story. This is a character picture.

Enjoy.",
19 June 2021,11 v 1,"I rewatched 12 Angry Men, on Film 4 yesterday. Apart from the very obvious point that all the jurors are white males and assumed to heterosexual (which does date the film) the film is a great study of how prejudices can influence the court proceedings. Each of the 12 jurors are excellently played and you get a sense of their respective background.

The story is well known and most definitely worth seeing.

In a apparent view it just seems a boring ""black n white"" storyline all based in one room where the jury just fight and object each other, but with a thorough inward consider it's a ""Dramatic-Crime"" masterpiece rather than a vintage screenplay... The basic point of the story is how do 12 vary men from different classes encounter with "" A Deal Of Murder"" and how there family and career background influence on there determination, or how the ""Minority"" could beat the ""Majority"" without arms and only by intellectual convincing ? Or simply how does justice occur? Anyway its just a never expiring artwork and a ""must see"" movie....

22 March 2021,12 Angry Men- The Greatest Question,"12 Angry Men is a movie about 12 people about to send a boy off to a death sentence, but someone has a different opinion of what everyone is saying. The best thing about this is the fact that even one man can change everyone's perspective. Also, the best part about everything in this film is the fact that you are the one who is supposed to tell rather he is guilty or not. Even at the end you do not know rather he did it. I'm not going to say to much about it because you should just watch it yourself. 10/10, a perfect mystery.

7 March 2008,Excitement in one room,"You couldn't make make me sit through this one again!

Watching 12 stereotypes shaken together until the cream rises to the top is little better than watching water come to a boil. At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!

Somehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).

I would recommend Andy Warhol's ""Empire"" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil.",5
29 December 2000,Solid. Period!,"For a film that takes places almost 100% of its entire time in one room with 12 actors, it is a brilliant piece of work not just for its great acting, but for its relevance.

Anyone seeing this film today, can remark on how the wheels of justice are no different than the trials of today, that people are filled with good faith, that there are people who are innocent, that there are times when what you see is not the entire truth, that people are cruel, that people are bigots, that people are heartless-disconcerting and these things still haunt us in our present lives, but mostly that someone can stand for their beliefs when everyone is against them and overcome them.

So perfectly portrayed. Looking at this film you will see that it is timeless, and that is what makes a film a classic work of art.

17 June 2008,One of the best ever,"Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such as Serpico or Q & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of ""reasonable doubt,"" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own tele play) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.

Starring: Martin Balsham, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Wardem. Director: Sidney Lumet.",10
5 July 2013,A triumph,"A young boy is accused of murder and every jury seems to find him guilty, expect one man, who tries to convince the others that maybe they are all mistaken. From that point, each man tries to separate the prejudice from the actual evidence and make up his own mind about the boy's guilt or innocence. For such a simple story, the film is tremendously intense and clever, and it will most likely keep you on the edge. The acting is absolutely flawless; the twelve men of the jury represent a wide spectrum of personalities, from the tempered and reasonable guy to the funny and naive one. Henry Fonda takes the cake and gives what must be one of the best performances of his life, but every other actor is equally brilliant. The whole story is developed in just one scenario and it often has clever and funny moments, becoming more and more tense as the film progresses. This film honestly blew me away. Does it deserve to have the seventh place in the top 250? It sure as hell does.

10 October 2011,Mortality coupled with relativity!,"First of all let me name it as classic. No other word will be sufficient I believe. Mortal is life so is life related things i guess. The mortal man is so preoccupied with the very concept of mortality and it overflows into everything he does: his words, opinion, character and the list goes on. It also reinstates the hard truth that everything and anything can be coloured so easily at our will.

And, one other thing is that man is mere puppets in the influence of his prejudiced mindsets. He doesn't even try to think instead just act on the spur of the moment.

Yet another aspect is, what's actually truth and is there truth indeed? Everything turns out to be mere the fabrication of words and vulnerable to errors I believe.

Mortality is coupled with relativity, a perfect companion for the mortal man to have on his side. Well, watching films is really educative. For, I've studied one other lesson too. Among the 12 Angry Men, most of them are really angry at themselves, being in this hellish status of life and may be the way they are compelled to live on. If its so, how can they value others life on which they are casting their vote. Love, correct, value ourselves first then to the other.. Isn't it the right path?",8
3 November 2008,An ignorant take on this classic,"I was born more than 40 years after the release of 12 Angry men so I'm from a different generation than the crowd that first saw it. I only know Lumet by his new films and I think this is the first film I've seen Henry Fonda act in. This is why I could watch this movie unbiased and without prejudice.

12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies that would not benefit from modern cinematography or acting. It is perfect as it is. Obviously the movie is this great because of its screenplay but all the technical aspects of it were at least on par with it so I had a really hard time guessing what decade the film was made. In my opinion what determines a movie's timelessness is its rewatchability and the ability to attract new viewers from new generations. 12 Angry Men definitely has both of these characteristics.

6 May 2006,How can anyone give it less than 9?????,"This movie deserves a perfect ten out of ten and has every chance to be in the list of all-time classics. It deserves the eighteenth rank it got in IMDb's best movies list. To summarize the plot: it is about twelve jurors on a murder trial. Eleven out of twelve think the defendant is guilty of murdering his father and one of them thinks, ""Element of Doubt"" still remains. The movie is about the character study of all the twelve people in that room trying to sift through all the evidence. The twelve men jury represent a cornucopia of Americans: the bigots, the prejudiced, the cool and calculated, the timid and the self-aggrandizing gloaters. It shows how some people get carried away by some outward appearances. At the end of the movie, we do not know if the defendant is actually guilty or not. We just know that there exists an element of doubt in the evidence provided. It shows how a careful evaluation reveals there could be something beyond what is obvious. As an academic researcher, I have been taught that most of the times, the most obvious solution could be wrong and this movie bears testimony to this fact. I think every jury member should be recommended this movie before he/she decides on the verdict.",10

20 September 2010,Brilliant In It's Simplicity,"Forty three years since the release of Sidney Lumet's debut, in a current cinematic age where films seem increasingly judged on the strength of their special effects or CGI, how refreshing it is that 12 Angry Men can still be considered a masterpiece.

On the face of it selling the premise of 12 Angry Men is no easy feat. The film focuses on the jury in the case of a young man facing the death penalty for the murder of his father. However, what's different is that 12 Angry Men is set almost entirely within a single, unremarkable room, as the twelve jurors try to reach a unanimous verdict.

Featuring such cinematic greats as Joseph Walden, Lee J. Cobb and the superb Henry Fonda the film relies purely on an excellent screenplay, fantastic dialogue and consistently excellent character development as the various prejudices of the twelve jurors are revealed. Because of unspectacular setting there is a fantastic feeling of claustrophobic suspense that dominates throughout Beginning with 11 jurors convinced the man is guilty, only Henry Fonda's character expresses any doubts. As the film plays out various ballots are taken where the characters give their verdict and increasingly Fonda's character places doubt in your mind that the other juror's opinions are clouded. In the history of film there are very few directors who could capture the suspense that Lumet generates from such a shabby, sparse setting, for instance each time the men take a ballot and it is revealed more and more of the jury have their doubts.

Compared to the stunt filled, special effects marathons that seem to dominate our screens today, 12 Angry Men still stands out as a ray of light that proves beyond doubt that excellent dialogue, screenplay and acting talent wins out on CGI any day.",9
2 September 2021,Simply Incredible!,"If you do not rate this 10 out of 10 you are probably just a rabid feminist who is upset that such an amazing movie could be made using 12 white males.

The acting is incredible (especially Lee J. Cobb), the plot is engaging, and the script is well-thought out. All of the little things that were done to make it feel realistic was quite impressive.

There is nothing like a good old movie. When you have some of the best actors to ever live and an incredible script there is no need for big-budget action scenes, nudity, or foul language to retain viewer attention. This movie grabs the viewers attention from the get-go and never lets go.

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.

The dialog, the facial expressions, the backgrounds of these people and how it affects their thinking is fantastic.

If you've never seen it and you call yourself a movie buff, you don't know what you're missing.

Most of these actors went on to great thing in their professions and it takes a very simple yet effective movie like this to showcase their acting talents.

20 June 2000,Guilt & Justice - A Lesson to us all,"A very good film that seems more suited to the stage. The story is simple yet concise and thought-provoking. A teenager with a history of crime behind him is charged with murdering his own father.

Most of the jury, the dis-interested judge and several witnesses are all of the same mind - guilty!!

Its left to one man, Number 8, (Henry Fonda) to use his liberal sense of justice & circumstance in defending the boy against impossible odds - especially when faced with one of the biggest cynics of the jury, Lee J Cobb(his best performance by far)

Lumet directs with great aplomb, the routine story is given extra life by the wonderful characters who really give a tour-de-force performance, and perhaps makes us feel guilty when we decide individuals in modern society are instantly guilty based purely on their ethnicity, social standing and other inner prejudices

But what I admired most was the camerawork. 90% of the film takes places in the juryroom where the 12 men (no women, no blacks - this was 1957!) deliberate. With a clever combination of lighting & tight camera angles you feel as if you can smell the clamminess & claustrophic atmosphere of that intense little room.

A weak point could be directed at Fonda for playing the whiter-than-white liberal rising above the savage right-wingers, and to be frank I didn't rate his performance much above mediocre - for me, his best role apart from On golden Pond would be Once Upon A Time in The West!

The true acting honours really go to Cobb and especially, Ed Begley, playing the racist redneck to a tee.

1 September 2008,blown away...,"I just watched this for the first time, ashamed to admit that the IMDb ranking was the first I'd heard of it. My excuse is that I am not American, and not a ""die-hard"" classic films fan. That being said, I really prefer movies with intelligence and a good realistic plot.

Now the movie itself... I was sitting 1,5 hours captivated by a black/white feature all taking place in one room with just talking...

The reason for this was the amazing acting by everyone involved. The characters really grab you, and you hang on every word. It is clear that these actors were ""forced"" to be more skillful, they had no special effects to cover their shortcomings.

It was like watching a room full of Daniel Day Lewis' going full blast for 90 min... anyway, that's what I thought of it :)

(and by the way, any remake of MUST cast DDL as that last, angry juror ;))",8
12 July 2015,Directorial masterpiece,"The whole movie is situated in one room with 12 angry jurors. But still, it managed to be amazingly gripping. There was not a single second in which i got bored. The mystery slowly progresses with details coming out every 10 minutes. It is a punch on the judicious system and shows beautifully how a persons life is dependent on 12 random jurors who do not care at all about him. Acting is superb. Character development is astounding because by the end i knew everything about every character. Overall the mystery is not as great as I had expected it to be,but the story brilliantly shows human nature which has made it one of the greatest movies ever.

10 June 2007,NOTHING beats this original,"Why make another version of this movie? I just finished watching the 1957 version and I admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. We'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. In fact, only Jack Klugman (at age 85) is still with us. Other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialogue and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). In fact, as I watched each actor, I identified with people I knew who had the same characteristics, such as Jack Warden's wise-ass, or Ed Begley, Sr.'s angry racist or Lee J. Cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. I do think that Jack Klugman's role may have been miscast. I didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. They could have cast a minority for his role but I guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.",10
29 November 2021,A great great movie,"I think this is the perfect example of when you have a great script, fantastic actors and a brilliant director who knows what he's doing: you acomplish wonderful things! The set hardly ever changes and all you have is this twelve men sitting there talking... but what might seem like a bored turns out to be the most engaging drama as they debate the case and we see moments of prejudice, social injustice, racism, discrimination, family drama and hurtful despondency from one member of the jury or the other.

18 June 2020,The movie is excellent and convincing,"The movie is excellent and convincing, The characters are well painted and each with his own personality.

they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.The film tells a story that may be simple but makes you think that making the decision is not easy, even if all the evidence is against the kid. It was through reason and logic that Henry Fonda persuaded the 11 jurors.

the simplicity of the plot and the setting of the one room and the acting talent of the 12 main cast members is enough to the perfect story to the movie

Whether you are a fan of old movies or not, I advise you to watch it",10
1 September 2015,An excellent film,"I first watched this film on DVD about ten years ago after my manager at work kept going on about how good it was. At first I was a bit wary thinking it was going to be just another court room drama. When the movie finished I realised what a masterpiece it was. How a movie could grip the attention of the audience for over 90 minutes with the whole film taking place, with the exception of a few minutes, in just one room was remarkable. The actors, each with their various characters, were excellent and the acting superb.....One of my most favourite films of which I never get tired of watching....if you have not seen it, watch and you will be impressed.

2 May 2023,Preposterous End Result but Engaging and Masterful Direction in the Early Days of Cinema,"Although I agree with the sentiment that there was reasonable doubt which characterises the entire plot, after reading up heavily on true crime and the methods a real life detective uses to find his suspect, I think there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the defendant was the most likely killer. Therefore, the movie plays heavily in sentiment and the ideal that no innocent man will ever be electrocuted to death. Which brings into debate an argument to abolish capital punishment. In the end, I think this kid could have done with 15 years to think about it, as although the ideal was upheld, in the end I think the defendant was a slippery fish that got away and a GUILTY one at that. Henry Fonda does the job of the defence and presents arguments that weren't heard in court, and the Judge, on hearing the Not Guilty verdict of the Jury, without hearing the argument, must have thought they had spent the last hour and a half smoking crack.

4 December 2021,Such a great movie,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.

19 April 1999,Separates the men from the boys.,"Take 12 great character actors and put them in one room for the entirety of the film, and do it without driving the audience crazy. How? By creating a masterpiece.

Henry Fonda had started to direct the film (he produced it) but instead gave the nod to first-timer Sidney Lumet (who would go on to a string of classics': Serpico, Prince of the City, The Verdict, Fail-Safe, Network).

Through his use of the camera, Lumet creates much of the drama here. The intense setting, the biting dialogue is all well complimented by perfect casting, each of the twelve is right on target, from Robert Webber to John Fiedler and everyone in between.

This film stands alone. It is blasphemous Showtime would do a remake in 1997 adding nothing to this fine original other than needless color film stock

Sit back and enjoy a wonderful, one-of-a-kind piece of dramatic film making

1 September 2017,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen..probably,"This film features the trial of a young man accused of murdering his father. All of the action takes place in one room - the jury room.

So much going on in this film. It is about evidence, closed-mindedness vs open-mindedness, gender (no women on the jury as women were not invented til 1984), lots of stuff. But mostly it is about class.

Henry Fonda is brilliant here. He is an architect, so it is reasonable to suppose that he is middle class, intelligent and open-minded. He votes not guilty, not because he believes the accused to be innocent, but because he's just not sure. He's on his own.

Gradually over the course of the film, he attempts to convert all of the other jurors...

There are jurors that are ignorant, jurors that are stupid. Jurors that are both. Jurors that just want to go home, not caring really about the guilt or innocence of the accused. All are challenged with Fonda's expert Socratic prodding..

Superb acting by everyone.

Interestingly, this is all achieved with on a budget of $3.43. I mean it all happens in one room, there are no explosions, and no car chases. Just a superb script, superb acting and big themes that make you think - out loud!

Not one single criticism.",10

7 January 2022,What a masterpiece from the late 50s!,"This marvelous story from the late 50s, is about a juror(Henry Fonda) who along with 11 other jurors, try to come up with a reasonable verdict for a murder trial. He believes that the accused in this case is innocent and in the beginning, he is the only person who has this particular opinion. Later on in this powerful tale, he manages to persuade the other jurors that the accused might be innocent with his skills of analyzing legal matters.

What surprised me the most was this: Usually, courtroom dramas often begin with a shot of the crime scene that took place whereas this movie starts directly with the jurors' discussion. It doesn't even have a trial but still has a capability to mesmerize people's minds with just ONE shot in ONE room. The heated discussion between the jurors along with the twists and turns in the statements of the witness, makes this movie greatly enthralling. I watched this movie with my family and all of us got so indulged in the movie that we found every scene fascinating. Besides, all the actors did a fabulous job being in a different character's shoe. Each juror had different thoughts and approaches towards the matter and the actors wonderfully embodied it.

Thus, I think that this flawless movie is a must-watch for every person who adores trials and courtroom dramas.",10

15 August 2018,Brilliant,"The term ""Masterpiece,"" is over used and thrown loosely. And few films truly are a masterpiece, and 1957's '12 Angry Men' is deinitely one of them.

This film is paced beautifully. Taking place in real time; it's never boring and constantly a moving plot that gets more tense and more tense by the minute. Entirely revolving around a single, long conversation, the film makes the audience feel the same amount of suspense and tension as a movie full of action.

Each character is very different, with different levels of persuasion and logic. And most of these characters have linking backstories that directly influence the actions that take place in the script. Credit is also heavily due to the real and powerful acting, especially from Lee J. Cobb.

I'd recommend this film to anyone and everyone as it is a stamp on film history in its incredibly creative inclusion of Clarity and Tension around such a small premise.",10

27 September 1999,great classic movie,"This movie is shot inside one single room, where the 12 chosen jury men try to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. It stars a great Henry Fonda trying to defend the boys life against the prejudice of many of the jury men. J. L Cobb is magnificent as an angry man who effortlessly ignores any argument that the defendant shouldnt ""fry"" in the chair. But as the film evolves, we learn that he has some built up anger towards society and that failure in life leads him to act the way he does. When he collapses in tears, muttering the words, not guilty, I had a tear in my eyes. Ronald Emmerich could never have made this. Its great.

19 January 2009,Guilty until proved innocent,"12 Angry Men is a film which should be taken for what it is. A brilliant and engaging script draws in the viewer and as the events unfold, we are left truly captivated.

The film shows how perceptions in human nature can be clouded by bias, prejudices, or indeed ones' desire to see a baseball game. The subject is even perhaps less about the actual guilt or innocence of the chosen party, than the turmoil the jurors have in deciding so.

Although this movie may be a tad plot-driven and lacking a bit of creativity in directing, taking the film for what it is, it is a great success.

3 February 2010,Brilliant!!!!,"This movie focuses on a case regarding the murder of a father by his own child. The judge asked the 12 jurors to conversate on various aspects and evidences of the case and finally put their decision before the court that whether the boy is guilty or not.

Unrevealing the details of case I want to write that this is, of course, one of the best movies that I ever saw. This movie confluences the intellect of the script writer with impeccable direction and formidable acting performances. The way the case was resolved, dealing with disclosed facts and the analyzation of the witnesses' testimonies in pragmatic way is extremely tremendous, and thus, making it one of the best in the history of Hollywood.

23 June 2014,Brilliant!,"12 Angry Men is just brilliant. It is a classic of course, but time goes by and many of us, young people, pass on smart movies like that, and that's a shame. But fortunately, I am here to talk about it.

12 Angry Men came out in 1957, it was made by Sydney Lumet and stars Henry Fonda, to name only one of the fantastic actors that made this movie so real. 99% of the action takes place in the Jury room. 12 Jurors are debating on a murder trial. A men, played by Henry Fonda, will try to convince his fellow juror of the innocence of the boy accused in this trial.

12 Angry Men is such a smart movie and evoke so many different themes through this one trial. It mainly shows how powerful is one man's speech. All of the beliefs about the case, the ones that seemed so obvious to the 11 other men, are refuting one after the other by the character of Henry Fonda, leading to heavy doubts in the jurors mind. The life of a boy depends on how will this man try to convince 11 others, of what he truly believes is the truth or at least the not certainty of it.

Through the movie, you feel the pain, the claustrophobia of being in this room, you just feel like you are the 13th member of the Jury.

All in all, of course it's an old movie, it's in black & white but please, don't pass on this movie, it has a strong message, and is the typical type of movie, precise, smart, deep, relevant..., that are strongly missing these days.",9
6 September 2023,"A Pretentious Amateur ""Detective"" Story","12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.

Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.

The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.

For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;

Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.

What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.

Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.

Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.

A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.

The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.

Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.

This is a manipulative and poorly written film designed to sow doubt where none exists and to instead have you believe in emotional reasoning over logic.",1
24 September 2000,One of the best movies ever made!,"This is one of my favorite movies. Henry Fonda once again proves that he's a fantastic actor with his brilliant performance. There are also great performances by notable actors such as Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Klugman, and John Fiedler.

""12 Angry Men"" proves that you don't need a fantastic scope to have a great movie: all but a few minutes of this takes place in a jury room, plus it's in black and white. All you need to create a classic is great actors, and a magnificent script. ""12 Angry Men"" has both of these, so I strongly recommend it! It's a must see.

20 October 2020,Amazing!!!,"I'm not into old movies. Usually, I find them irrelevant mostly because most of the classics are made in the US and I don't know much of the '40-'70s decades background. When I watch a movie I'm trying to understand everything, Particularly when it's about a movie with no action whatsoever. The thing about 12 angry men is that you can watch it even after 100 years and it still a depiction of human nature, of how we can understand each other, of how we can discuss a fact, of how we can understand each other, Of how we can trust each other and of course how we can come to a conclusion regarding another person's life.

I'm not very much schooled about the art of acting, but I'm just talking like a profane, Who has witnessed a magnificent performance from all 12 actors involved in this picture. It's just outstanding! I've always thought that in old movies, actors are over exaggerating and that they are very dramatic in a sense that sometimes it's on the verge of ridiculous, But the thing is that in this movie I felt that I saw 12 different man Took from the streets and asked to be themselves and come to a conclusion. With this in mind I can state that this is the quintessential of acting at its most amazingly greatness.

If you are somebody that doesn't like old movies, like me, I strongly advise you to watch this one.",10
26 August 2014,A simple plot turns into one of the deepest stories ever told.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
2 April 2018,Great classic.,"They don't make 'em like they used too, obviously as you'll never have a jury composed of 12 white men ever again. But this is all about drama, no special effects, just a fine ensemble of actors. A story that has elements of a whodunnit after the trial ends, which seems watertight. Seems like a quick vote and let's get out of here. Then someone, ""there's always one"" starts raising questions, along with the temperature. So you then get clashes of ego, culture and background, very entertaing film.

14 August 2007,Reasonable doubt,"""12 Angry Men"" is about a jury of 12 men voting on a death sentence case. Eleven of the men see it as an open and shut case with a clear verdict of guilty. However, one of the men thinks there is reasonable doubt.

The majority of the film takes place in the deliberation room with the 12 men discussing the case. Even though the film takes place mostly in this single room and is singularly focused on the 12 men discussing the case, the film is never tedious. On the contrary, while a lot of films have slower moments, this one is gripping from start to finish.

Each of the 12 performances is strong and each of the 12 jurors' characters is well-developed and adds to the film. Henry Fonda is inspiring as the one man who believes there is cause for reasonable doubt. ""12 Angry Men"" is a triumph of minimalist filming and highly recommended.

17 November 2022,After Thoughts,"What a truly perfect movie! This movie amazed me, I have heard of this movie many times and have had a great many friends recommend it to me. But I never knew a thing about the plot. And I am so greatful I knew nothing about the plot when going into this movie. Because this was a privilege to watch without any expectation. From the acting to the cinematography it could not have been done any better. I loved every piece of this movie, and will be watching it several more times again. I will also say the history of the making of this movie is amazing, I can not wait to delve into this history more.

3 May 2017,Classic never fails to impress a movie lover,"The characters played by each of jury is so perfect that there is nothing to miss. Story and plot is so gripping despite it shot inside a room.

Apart from Henry Fonda's calm and composed character, I highly impressed with Lee Cobb's performance which for me is stand out overall. Movie gives lot of us to think about how little un-noticed details matter in lives.

I recommended to my cousin typical Y2K generation who are much into Sci-Fi and animation stuff, and they too loved it which not surprised me at all.

29 April 2021,Great story,"12 Angry Men is a courtroom drama centered on a jury. There has been a murder, and on trial is the young african american son of the victim. The entire jury is unanimous, and believe the boy is guilty. One of the jurors however, Davis, believes that the young man is innocent, and votes not guilty. Argument ensues.

This film is kept alive by its phenomenal story and the incredible performances. The cinematography, editing and music choices are slightly off. The story and pacing however defined the genre for generations, and made the film a classic.

The film has its flaws, and they are easily identifiable. Several scenes display what is clearly the shadow of a boom mic, covering the entire background wall. All because the director didn't bother thinking about their lighting.

10 May 2020,Unlike the movie nothing is just black or white,"The movie was black and white but all it prooved was nothing is just black or white in this world. Everything is grey maybe some things are closer to the black or white from other. Movie questioned almost every concept: What is truth, what is justice, what is guilty, what is crime or most importantly what is doubt? There were almost only 12 characters and only one place in the movie. But with every character I was able to find something about people I know on them. That is the power of an amazing movie. I will never forget this remarkable movie.

25 September 2017,12 Angry Men,"I love these types of movies. One setting, a bunch of actors, and no room for actors trying to phone in their performances.

This film is very compelling. We see 12 Men debating whether this young boy is innocent of murdering his father. A serious crime that will lead to him being given the death penalty if found guilty and all the jury, but one is convinced he did it.

This movie shouldn't be such a good watch. But it is. I've no real interest in the inner workings of law, but I was very fascinated by it and the movie run time flew by. Which is a good sign that you're watching an absolute classic. A must watch for sure.

24 December 2020,A classic masterpiece.,"This movie should be shown in school and the values it conveys should make a comeback in todays society. This honest, slow-paced, actionless white and black movie, mostly shot in a single room, is more profound and deeper than most colourful, action-packed, CGI-filled blockbusters. It is a cinematic experience EVERYONE should see, reflect on and learn from because even though it's been 63 years, this masterpiece is important still.

What a sophisticated yet easy way to show the essence of argumentation and objectivity! All a student who is about to watch this needs to have is a bit of patience, because in an era of action-full movies not every youngster will attentively sit and watch 12 adult men arguing in a small room, sweating like hell for an hour and a half, moreover in a black-and-white picture:D

19 September 2001,so very underrated,"Stiffed for some Academy Awards by the masterpiece ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and unfortunately left off of the AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, ""12 Angry Men"" has its rightful place as #25 on the Top 250 list on IMDB - it deserves it. A fantastic film from start to finish, ""12 Angry Men"" had me glued to the screen, taking in every line of dialogue. Going by the KISS theory (Keep It Simple, Stupid), the entire movie takes place in the jury deliberation room and has a very small cast.

Very intelligent and over far too fast, ""12 Angry Men"" is a real classic. Let's hope its legacy will live on.

22 December 2007,One of the greatest character studies of all time,"What better way to analyse the persona's of twelve men than to film a heated jury meeting. Throughout the length of Sidney Lumet's twelve angry men little things were picked up by me and gave me ideas in my mind as to the mindset of each of these twelve men. None of the jurors had boring persona's. The director (Sidney Lumet) didn't put people in just to make up numbers. The movie would have been awful if all the dialogue was cut up between three or four characters and thankfully it wasn't. The movie sways a lot at times as well we have scenes of enigmatic melancholy counter balancing with heart warming innocence. Some movies even great movies have characters to make up numbers but as I mentioned earlier on, twelve angry men doesn't. Some criticise saying the movie makes stereotypical views of conservatives but I don't watch it from a political view. It is full of very moving and powerful scenes and if you want a movie to make you think go for this.

3 August 1999,"Great, A Classic every sense of the word","12 Angry Men is about a jury arguing over the innocence/guilt of a young man who did/didn't murder his father.

Sidney Lumet's directorial debut is nothing short of remarkable. One of the best debut films, second only Citizen Kane. He uses the claustrophobic one-set and uses no special effects (unless you count the rain in one scene) to great effect.

This as an ensemble cast to die for, including future oscar winners as Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Henry Fonda.

Simply a stunning achievement. How the AFI didn't put it on the top hundred, I'll never understand

23 May 1999,Brilliant and intense,"This film is shot entirely in a small room ( with the exception of approx. 3 mins, in the beginning and end) and is the perfect example of characterization. One of the three best films of 1957 ( the other two being Paths of Glory and Bridge on the River Kwai) this is a brilliant movie. One of the few films where one set is an asset, this shows both sides of a coin when juries deliberate. The acting, especially by Henry Fonda, is stunning. IF there was an Oscar for best ensemble cast, this movie would have won it. Why it wasn't on the AFi 100 is beyond me ( and I agree with most of the choices). In the end, what makes this film so great is its humanity, and it shows us that we all need humanity.

31 January 2005,Best Courtroom Drama Ever Made,"The concept behind this film is so simple and yet it is brilliant. Set almost entirely in one New York jury room on the hottest day of the year as twelve jury members discuss the case of an 18 year old man accused of murdering his father. A guilty verdict would mean the death penalty. On the face of it, the case seems simple and eleven of the jurors vote ""guilty"" but one man (Henry Fonda) dissents and tries to talk his fellow jurors around. The events of the film take place in real time and as the film progresses more and more of the characters of the individual jurors and their individual prejudices are revealed.

This film provides gripping drama, brilliantly scripted (from a television play by Reginaled Rose) and performed by a brilliant cast. This is justifiably a classic of cinema, much more than a legal thriller it is also an exploration of individual morality (witness the casualness with which some of the jurors are ready to condemn a man to his death). If you have any interest in American cinema, superb acting or just want a great piece of entertainment, don't miss this!",10

27 December 2002,"First listen, then watch","12 Angry Men was the highest ranked films in the imdb ""Top 250 Movies of All-Time"" that I had never heard from. That was my main reason for renting it.

Before I go on I must admit that I like black and white movies much, and if you don't then reconsider watching this movie, 'cause there isn't much action to divert you from the fact that it is in b/w.

This is one of the few movies witch I'd say you d have to see before you may saying that old movies aren't as good as the new ones.

The movie is about one man who stands up to eleven other men and tries to turn them over to his side one by one. He does this by questing facts and using sentimental reasons. The film gives a clear view of how it can go and how it should go in murder cases.

Except for the first few moments, the film is played almost entirely in one room witch is actually too small for twelve men. You see the evolution in people and the way they think and act.

The cast is very small ant that makes it possible to identify yourself with every one of the jury members.",9

22 March 2012,Who would have thought 12 men sitting at a table could be so exciting?,"12 Angry Men is a film that wasn't hailed as revolutionary at the time. In fact, it didn't make AFI's first ""100 films"" list and was only ranked #87 after the revision. It wasn't even a box office success when it was released. Despite all that, its with good reason that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb's top 250 list.

12 Angry Men is one of the few films ever made that is excellent in every regard, in some regards it feels almost flawless. The acting is top-notch from every actor involved, with Lee J. Cobb in particular standing out with one of the best performances I've seen in a film (in particular his speech near the end). The directing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the pacing throughout is spectacular. This is one of those films that is very hard to dislike, in my experience even younger audiences with lower attention spans or those who dislike black and white films have, with very few exceptions, really enjoyed this film.

One aspect that I want to single out is the editing and pacing, which stands out as some of the best I've ever experienced. All but a very few scenes take place in the jury room, and yet the film is ""edge of your seat"" material throughout. More than that, every single time I watch it I feel as the jurors feel. It starts out slow, like there's nothing to deliberate. When the jurors begins speaking a little more seriously, a little more angrily, you can feel your heart beating faster. Then the tension builds even more and just when I feel like I can't handle any more, the jurors take a break and walk around the room and cool off and wipe sweat off their brows just as I do while watching. The pacing is absolutely perfect, the fact that so many films are filled with gratuitous sex and constant violence and yet fail to enthrall me like this film, it speaks volumes as far as the quality and greatness of the film in all areas.

The most criticized element of the film is the ending (which I won't spoil) and really the entire process that is begun by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), which is kind of out of bounds as far as how a jury is supposed to work. In real life, yes, what happened in the jury room, would probably have been enough for the whole situation to have led to a mistrial. But this criticism really misses the point of what is something of a ""message movie"", although not in an obnoxious way. Its a look at the justice system, the fact that a life is being put in the hands of twelve individuals with their own stories and, necessarily, their own biases. And indeed, a human life is worth enough to at least ""talk about"". The film takes a good hard look at the legal system, and its worthwhile and personally has led to many good discussions with others who have seen the film.

12 Angry Men isn't a film that was the first of its kinds, its ideas aren't necessarily unique. Its excellence in every category and the tremendous direction and pacing (and Lee J. Cobb) is enough to make this a favorite of mine and a film that will be enjoyed by almost anyone who watches it.",10

15 February 2003,As fresh and gripping the third time as it was the first!,"Can a film about 12 men sitting in a jury room deliberating the fate of one young man accused of murder be as exciting as any action film you've ever seen? Maybe! This movie takes place almost entirely in one room, but there is more going on in that room than you'd ever believe. This film fascinated me from beginning to end. I've seen it three times recently and it seemed just as fresh and gripping the third time as it did the first. What makes this movie so great? First of all, the script and the characters are intricate and well developed. Second of all, the acting from the ensemble cast is uniformly riveting. Third, the camera work in this film is the best you'll ever see anywhere. Fourth, the movie has something to say about about prejudice and justice without being preachy. It simply is on a search for truth. For my money, this is one of the finest dramas ever made. Henry Fonda is right on target as the architect who has reasonable doubts. Each of the other 11 actors give stellar performances of unique men who open up like books as the story proceeds. You'll be thinking about this movie long after the jury has reached a verdict. This movie is as relevant today as it was 45 years ago. Don't miss it. I give it a 94/100!",9
30 August 2009,Ed Begley,"I agreed with the vast majority of the remarks made in the critiques of this great movie - I think you are on safe ground when you call this film a 'classic'.

It has always been a source of surprise to me that Henry Fonda had to wait until he was almost dead before the Academy Award voters finally got the wool out of their collective heads and gave him the Oscar he had deserved for 30 years.

Fonda is the only real 'star' out of this movie but I have always been a fan of Jack Warden - a really excellent supporting character actor.

E. G. Marshall is another of my favourite support actors - finishing his career in big time movies with an excellent cameo in 'Absolute Power' - the only David Baldacci book to successfully translate to big screen, thanks to Marshall and the excellent Gene Hackman.

None of the reviewers mention much about Ed Begley - not the greatest of actors but good in this and also in 'Million Dollar Brain' playing a megalomaniac with KKK overtones.",9
24 June 2005,A must see for everyone,"12 angry men is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most important American films ever. Ed Bagley is perfect as a rather ruthless, and somewhat, bigoted jorur. Henry Fonda give a rather fine performance as a cool under fire juror who is one the only ones to actual have an idea of what a juror should do. The way he baits at times the other juror members is amazing. Jack Klugman, in a small role, actually shows a true dramatic talent, serving him as one of the most versatile actors ever. This role, despite how small it is, Klugman gives a better performance then his more celebrated role on TV's The odd couple. My personal favorites of the movie are E.G. Marshall and Joseph Sweeney. Sweeney, in his last movie, leaves on a high note a wise old man. E.G. Marshall has a slight arrogance about him, and seems like he'd be the last person that Fonda would get to swing his way. Marshall almost upstages everyone else, despite like Klugman, playing a small role. Without a doubt, this movie is a must have for anyone collects.

26 May 2012,just brilliant!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

31 May 2002,"An excellent ""jury room drama"" - ****","Especially in our current state, the focus is more and more on special effects and visual appeal than on strong plots and good acting. While many great movies have told their stories through visuals, ""12 Angry Men"" takes the opposite approach, telling the story through its characters, creating the feel of a stage play.

The premise is that a young minority boy is charged with murdering his father. Every jury member except one (Henry Fonda), believes that the boy is guilty. Fonda doesn't necessarily believe him to be innocent, but rather that he just isn't sure. He begins his attempt to point out how he feels and why he feels that way. Through this, he reveals the insecurities and prejudices that are within everyone.

The acting is first rate, from the angry, stubborn Juror #3 to Fonda, who creates a sense of integrity that he does so well. Each man has a unique angle, and every actor portrays them well.

The story and script are as close to perfect as can be. I don't mean that the movie is perfect, but rather that this is a premise that is difficult to execute. It would be easy to write this story so that it would not flow well, but it flows smoothly. Perhaps one of the best screenplays of all time.

The themes of this movie - it is more or less a character study - are beautifully written in. They never become heavy handed, but are still easily seen. Every man on the jury has some reason to quickly decide guilty, whether it be indifference, their own personal struggles, or prejudices.

This movie is not a masterpiece of visual achievement. It takes a rather unique approach to cinema, and makes itself a masterpiece in its own way.",9
28 August 2013,"Who would knew that 12 ""Angry"" men in a room on a long dialog would become an ULTIMATE CLASSIC? Really who?!","12 Men with totally different personalities, located in a room with a bathroom, proved only through words and insults that justice is not an exact science. And also managed to become a timeless classic in the history of cinema thanks to a 20 years old director, Sidney Lumet cheers!

The story of ""12 Angry Men"" is not one that can be reinvent or repeated (despite the fact that it had a good and underrated Reboot in 1997), because the young Lumet and screenwriter Reginald Rose made it a unique experience (and experience several times if you buy on Blu-Ray or download through the internet, easy enough). Everything begins on a normal day like any other in a court where the camera follows the corridors, and shows people and lawyers walking from one side to the other, people getting out fresh from the courtroom, some relieved some doesn't. Once we are in one room with the judge finishing the meeting and sending the 12 juries to the other room to decide the final sentence of a 18 year old boy that, as the evidence presented, ""prove"" that he killed his father in a rage attack. The Jurors come into the other room, normal mans who had never met and are there to lend their public service. All normal as if nothing was happening, certain that all the evidence is concrete and the boy is guilty, and a cold-blooded killer. But juror nº 8 (Henry Fonda) disagrees, he does not believe in the innocence of the boy, but also do not believe in his guilt. Now one man must face 11 that fully believe in the guilt of the boy and are tired to go home.

Nowadays, the film for this new generation would be boring or perhaps ""impossible to happen"". Perhaps the film has to be viewed with a free and spirit mind to see the tremendous and beautiful message of justice that Lumet's classic tries to transmit. The film, NEVER for one minute gets to be boring or incomprehensible, the direction is superb and all that, but it's the script and the performances that stand out strongly in the film. A story that goes inside one room (and bathroom) had to have one writing at the level of ""non- boring "", no problems with Reginald Rose's screenplay with an amazing flowing narrative, I dare say that perhaps this is the best screenplay ever written (up there with ""The Godfather"" and ""Pulp Fiction"").

From the beginning the audience grasps the plot heavily, not only by the superb script, but the wonderful performances. In the cast we have all the kings of acting from the golden age of cinema, from the heroic Henry Fonda to the ferocious Lee J. Cobb (juror nº 3), to the calm John Fiedler (juror nº 2) and the satirical Jack Warden (juror No. 7). I say the names of the actors because none of them mentions the name throughout the film, really putting the audience in that room with those men discussing the case.

I say that the film proves that justice is not an exact science, because thanks to the character of Henry Fonda, the film is full of arguments and assumptions against all evidences presented at the beginning of the case, the case is not shown but through dialogs from the 12 characters. Arguments that are not only to the 12 to think and reflect, but to the movie's audience. Such arguments come in the form of structured dialogs; several of them focus on various topics since politics to social problems and even ophthalmology. The film is not boring annoying also because of the various funny moments with a good intelligent humor, but where there is room for humor there is too no place for pure tension between the characters, tension coming only by words .

A classic that will forever be etched and remembered in cinema, thanks to a flawless script and a marvelous cast, a film full of tension and humor and a message of justice that fits perfectly in our today's society, and an emotive finale, ""12 Angry Men"" is a must see film at least once in your lives. and many more for pure pleasure!",10

15 May 1999,Breaking the rules.,"12 Angry Men breaks the rules of screenwriting:

Instead of showing us the story, it tells us the story through the dialogue of the jurors.

Instead of giving the eyes a visual feast, it hunkers down in a single room (aside from a couple of opening shots).

Instead of giving us a clear cut protagonist and a clear cut antagonist, it gives us twelve visible characters and one invisible character caught up in a web of indecision.

And it's brilliant. Sometimes you just gotta break the rules.

10 November 2020,Must see,"This is one of my all time favourite films. Claustrophobic, you can almost smell the sweat. I don't know whether it's me, but I see echoes of America today. All the characters are indentifiable, the irrational and the rational elements of society both there and possibly in the UK as well. Take a look to see an acting masterclass from all involved. A definate must see.

8 April 2013,Slightly over-rated.,"First off I want to say I liked the movie. It had great performances all around and a compelling story. And I'm a fan of Henry Fonda and Jack Klugman. My problem is I'm puzzled that this film has such a high ranking on IMDb ? I can think of at least 10 better films (in my opinion) that are ranked far below this one.

This is a classic film and I think it's well made and still holds up after 50+ years. I guess I just had high expectations for a movie in the IMDb top 10. It sounds silly but I think I would have enjoyed it more if was rated 200th !

17 January 2018,A timeless classic.,"This is probably one of the greatest and most important movies ever made. While I still love The Dark Knight to bits, I believe 12 Angry Men should be above that on the IMDb top 250.

Where do I start? The screenplay is one of, if not the best, ever written, and is probably the best aspect of the movie, even above the incredible acting, which I'll get to. The way characters talk in this movie, you learn so much about them, their lives, and their prejudices and why they feel the way they do about the accused. Not only that, so many startling revelations that keep you hooked throughout. It's all really smart, without being pretentious.

Again, the acting is incredible. All the jurors gave the required depth to their characters, and then some. I felt like they were people in real life. Speaking of real life, you do feel like you're there, like you're also a jury, thanks, again, to the writing, but also the cinematography. It's brilliant.

Also, I must mention, the pacing is perfect. Fast, but not too fast, and with the perfect runtime. We never feel bored, yet the story unfolds naturally.

I think I just found my new favorite movie.",10

26 August 2015,One of the best films in Cinema history,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time in a business class and that day I made my a trip that I have never forgotten. It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it. It is a trip of understanding, of doubting about everything and a lesson about the truth that usually is not something that can be seen at a first look. A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position.

If you like thrillers, justice films and you like interesting dialogues, this is your film. However, it is going to ask you for your concentration and tenacity.

8 February 2018,12 Angry Men's message is relevant 60 years on,"Growing up in the 60's my first experience with courtroom drama was watching Perry Mason defending the innocent by uncovering all the hidden facts. The first courtroom movie that I remember was the classic '12 Angry Men' Made in 1957, the same year as the first series of Perry Mason, the film tells the story of a jury that has to consider the innocence or guilt of an 18-year-old boy accused of killing his father. If found guilty the boy would face a mandatory death sentence.

95% of the film is shot in the one room to which the jury has retired to consider their verdict. In considering the age of the movie, the first thing you notice is that to be judged by your 'equals' in the 1950's meant to sit before 12 white males. As the jurors enter the room, their flippant remarks and labelling of the male defendant, who comes from the slums, shows a wide range of bias, bigotry and lack of concern for the outcome they are to make a judgement on. What appears to be a simple decision of all voting guilty is thrown into disarray when juror 7, Henry Fonda, goes against the grain and votes Not Guilty. So begins a journey that requires each man present to consider their own status in life and whether there may be a reasonable doubt that the boy is guilty.

There is no doubt that the movie has aged but the exploration of each jurors motivation helps each character develop. The decision to only identify each man by their juror number and with no background provided the viewer is free to identify with one or more characters based on their own views of morality and ethics. The room has no cooling and as the heat of the day grows and the men become more visibly uncomfortable the claustrophobic atmosphere helps build the tension. The use of close-ups as characters make statements also gives you a sense of how small the room is as tempers fray.

While the movie has aged the premise is not much different to a number of documentaries shown recently that ask people to face their own intolerances such as refugees or indigenous communities. If the defendant was not an abused boy from the New York slums but an aboriginal or Muslim youth from the western suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane I believe we would see 'our peers' struggle with a similar dilemma as the cast of this movie. One by one each character has to question their initial conclusion and determine whether the verdict of guilty should stand.

While Henry Fonda is the star of the movie, the cast many of the respected male actors of the period with Lee J Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G Marshall and a young Jack Klugman of Quincy and The Odd Couple fame. To watch the movie now the acting is certainly over dramatic in parts but the idea of giving everyone a fair go, doing what is right when the numbers are against you and facing your own bias when judging others are still important concepts today. If you are into your older movies and haven't seen 12 Angry Men take the time to watch it on Netflix",8
12 February 2018,A perfect piece of work,"This movie has been on my radar for a very long time, consistently placing in all the Best Movies of All Time lists I've come across. Now I can testify to the fact that this movie is nothing short of cinematic brilliance! Every single moment in the movie, from the minute expressions to the big proclamations, had me marveling. The actors have performed with such sheer honesty that I couldn't take my eyes away.

Most of the run time, I was gushing over the cast, their little jokes and long speeches, but it would be a crime for me to not mention the direction and the cinematography. The movie was shot so intimately, creating an almost unsettling feeling in the viewer. I could feel a persistent adrenaline rush throughout the run time. Every time there was a vote call, my heart would beat a little faster while awaiting the verdict. This is the very first time that I have watched a movie with any of these cast members and I realized what I had missed out on. From the moment the jurors enter the jury room to the moment after the verdict when they go back to their respective stations in life, these fine actors made me feel a connect to the characters and to the story, leaving me completely engrossed. That is possibly the biggest victory of a movie made in the past: Standing the test of time. And boy, did this movie exceed all my expectations.

As I read the trivia after I finished watching the movie, I realized that at the current moment of my viewing, in 2018, all of the jurors have passed on. But to have been a part in making a timeless legacy like this one, maybe that's what it means, to have lived a fulfilling life.

A timeless classic like no other I've watched so far. Will definitely watch again.",10
1 August 2020,"My favorite recommendation, never fails","This is a movie I always recommend and but find it difficult to explain why, because the main plot seems very basic at first and there is not much to say about it, but once you are watching it, it traps you, every character is interesting on their own way. Masterfully written, it is more exciting than many other big blockbusters.

2 October 2022,We need Davis in every era!,"Definitely, this film is considered one of the most important films in the history of cinema and is a valid reference for education. First of all, it should be mentioned about the story of the film, that in my opinion, as long as politics and power do not have time to save human lives, this film is alive. We need Davis in every era, to invite people to speak before they make their own judgments. In terms of technique, the film is far ahead of the films of its time, the camera introduces the characters to us very intelligently, and the composite of the images in each sequence is very surprising. The rhythm of the film compels the viewer to follow the conversation and is also a good help to understand the author's statement correctly, that we are gathered together to talk, hear and check whether someone is accused, guilty or not.

22 February 2002,THE BEST DAMN COURTROOM MOVIE EVER!!!,"Twelve Angry Men was on again and for the umpteenth time I just had to watch it. No action, special effects, naked women, scary monsters or aliens. Nope none of that stuff. Instead you get a superb, if not great story with some of the best acting from different and varied actors that I have ever seen. Truly a magnificent masterpiece. It is hard to believe that 12 men in a claustraphobic jury room would make for an entertaining and engrossing movie.But, it does so brilliantly. There is no courtroom drama with lawyers that packs the punch that this movie does. It makes for a bit of a civics lesson as well. You can't help but feel locked into this room with these 12 guys with radically different lives and personalities. I think it would be interesting to see a 12 angry women passing judgement on an accused rapist. I think this story is timeless and will always work because of the basics of the story. Great hard hitting writing, great powerful dramatic story, great direction,great performances and acting. After viewing it last night, I'm going out to buy it. This movie isn't a rental, it is without a doubt a buyer. There aren't any better than this in this genre.

28 March 2020,12 Angry Men Review,"I do love these types of movies. You have one location and a bunch of actors that have to play off one and another to sell the story and their performances. This is when you can tell whether you're a great actor or just a good actor. It helps that the script was incredibly well written too. This film captives the audience from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until it's over.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

Henry Fonda knocks it out of the park with his performance in this film. You can feel his characters discomfort as the others belittle and mock how he can believe this young man could be innocent. You feel for him. You also share in his victories as he slowly casts doubt in each of the jurors' minds. For me, Henry Fonda should have at a bare minimum been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, and although it would have been a tough call, he should have won it too. Because in my opinion, his performance was better than Alec Guinness performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai.

I just wished they made films like this today.",8
23 February 2004,My all-time favorite,"My absolute favorite movie of all time. Stars Henry Fonda and a variety of big stars as jurors forced to decide the fate of a suspected killer. Henry Fonda plays a juror who decides that the suspect is innocent and must face scrutiny from the other members of the jury and must battle them to prove the suspect is not guilty. Fonda truly shows a hero who tells viewers to fight for something you believe and fight against the odds even when people are against you. This is my favorite movie of all - time because of the conflict, struggle and tension between the men, along with the dramatic camera angles provided by the great Sidney Lumet who sets the entire story in one room where tension and anger begin to rise between the men in isolation. Henry Fonda is a great compliment to this movie giving an unbelievable top - notch performance displaying why they call him ""The Every Man"".

15 April 2020,"One of a kind, Masterpiece","This is a movie like no other. Modern day viewers never saw anything like it. movies now a days are so much complicated, full of so much unrealistic things and graphics and destruction and violence and what not. But this movie meets all the requirement of being a perfect enactment. it has just one scene, one location everything happens in a single room, yet never feel small. you go through all sorts of emotions in this one single room. You will never find such kind of direction, acting in contemporary movies. all the actors are just out of the world. makes us feel deep inside who we really are and how we really act as humans. What is the true nature of human beings. We can relate everything to our own selves. It seems like the core of our souls are Leaked to the movie actors and they are acting out the characteristics we have as humans, and also points out the flaws and how can we correct them, how to think and not be an animal like human but becoming a human like human. a must watch movie for movie fans.

16 January 2021,One of the best ever!!!,"Watched this movie 12 years ago and cannot yet whenever I have to name one of the best movies I have ever seen, this movie is never forgotten.

The story is simple, but the execution is brilliant. Not for once did I feel that the movie was made in 1957 and therefore things could have been done differently now. This is a story driven movie and is recommended to every cinema living audience.

27 June 2023,Well It's Better Than The Re-Make.....,"Lee J. Cobb singlehandedly could have ruinsed this film with his yelling and overacting and supremely annoying nature. Ed Begley doesn't help out much either with an equally over the top redundant presence. All the other performances are actually quite good although Jack Warden tends to get on the nerves occasionally as well. The story is original and excellent, and despite some flimsy arguments used to acquit the kid, the movie is compelling in parts. Actually it's pretty obvious they let a guilty go free because they looked through rose colored glasses at the facts but that's not the issue because stuff like that happens every day in our system. The exchanges between the jurors were ridiculous at times and believable at others. Inconsistent yet enjoyable. The 9 rating is absurd, especially since it really doesn't hold up over the years as good as some others of the era. I'd put it at a 7 but am gonna rate a 5 to counterbalance the inflated rating here.

22 October 2010,My Take On 12 Angry Men,"I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see. Well before you see the remake. Just for some laughs.",7
20 November 2012,Must see to know what is democracy and freedom!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

Actors of delight play their roles and the plot is addictive from the very first minutes, although no, from the first seconds!

This film can be reviewed hundreds, no, thousands of times! It inspires with its novelty, although it was filmed so long ago, it makes us live, feel and touch the present!

I am in awe and delighted!

I recommend everyone to watch this movie.

7 February 2003,This movie alone justifies there being a film-business.,"Ah, I remember being a kid watching 12 Angry Men on TV for the first time. I was blown away, 13 years old and seeing Henry Fonda for the first time. Nah, forget that, I was seeing every one of these 12 actors for the first time. This was also the first film I watched by Sidney Lumet.

I didn't even know who these guys were until they crawled onto my screen and began rattling my brain. This story truly takes you deeper than almost any other story, the acting performances here are absolutely wonderful and seeing as you're getting not one or two memorable performances but TWELVE, this is one special movie.

Sure, it's black'n'white. Sure, the sound isn't as good in old movies as it is nowadays. But you know what? If you do not like this movie you do not like movies at all. Period.

It's the way Henry Fonda manages to be completely invisible, despite being the lead character, allowing the rest of the cast to completely shine when they're called upon!

It's the way the camera is not watching these twelve angry men from a distance, rather that it is AMONGST them, giving you the feeling that you are pretty much the 13th juror. Which prompts you to make up your own feelings on the given issue of the story as well as getting you so aroused and hot-blooded about the proceedings that you feel as if it were you on trial! Never before (or after) has a movie ever inspired such interaction on my behalf as a watcher...

It's the way the jurors remain anonymous until after they've reached a verdict and emerged from the room, each going their separate ways. I never would have thought a simple line like, ""what's your name?"" could possibly have such a strong effect on me in a film. But, as with most other things about this movie, seeing is believing.

But, enough of the hype already. There's a reason Sidney Lumet is legendary, as well as Henry Fonda, Lee J Cobb and all the rest! There's a reason this movie is on every film-educated man's Top-whatever list of favorites. There's a reason it is such a praised piece.

Haven't seen it? Then you're in for a treat...one of the very best movies ever, and I say that without hesitating.

5/5 (same as the re-make)",
14 June 2014,Fantastic Movie,"This movie must be in everyone's watch list...

This is the second black/white movie that i have watched after psycho. Now i have decided to watch all the best black/white movies based on reviews just because of this ""12 Angry Men"".

The movie focus on strong dialogue's , i have never watched a movie that goes only by dialogue's.. hats off to the director and the 12 angry actors who has lived as their characters....

The most interesting concept in the movie is that they have never showed, what had happened in the crime scene..? That makes the viewers to keep guessing as what would have happened....? Is really the boy murderer or not???

This movie ,surely deserve 8.9 rating..

Don Miss this fantastic movie.....",10
26 January 2011,Whoa! This is called direction!,"I have always been seeing this movie in IMDb's top 250. To be honest, every time I see the year of release I just skip it. Finally yesterday I got the mood to watch this movie and so I did. Right now, I feel so much glad that I saw it. Better late than never at all.

A timeless classic. What!! a direction. Sheer talent! Ironically, words are eluding from me to praise this movie where words/dialogs/talking play a pivotal role. Just a single room, 12 men and 96 mins. Henry Fonda, Reginald Rose and Sidney Lumet prove that its more than just enough to capture your full attention. Stupendous!

This movie shows that one's conviction and attitude can get him through whatever he wants! Casual acting by all the actors. It's simply cool.

As they say don't judge a book by its cover, I say don't underestimate this movie just because its released some 50 years ago. Watch it to believe it! This will surely make it to your top favorites no matter how many more years will pass by and how many more movies will get released. This movie has already left its mark in Hollywood and will leave a lasting impression in you too!

Thanks!",

10 June 2002,12 GREAT actors,"This is such a good movie. I am not a big fan of old black and white movies, but this is a big exception. It is amazing how such a limited cast (just 16 people) can be so great and make this movie really shine. But, I think that is the mark of really great actors. I am no fan of Henry Fonda, but I do think this is his best work. The rest of the jurors are also extremely good. The mark of a good actor I believe is making us understand the character from the start of the movie. We know what each juror is thinking from the start of the movie. We don't have to have extensive character development because the characters are already developed in our minds.

This movie could NOT be done properly today, and any director who has thoughts of doing a remake should rethink it.

24 October 2010,Intense court room drama,"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. A movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars.",7
29 April 2003,12 Angry Men: A single room ... and perfection!,"After seeing Sidney Lumet's version of Reginald Rose's play several times I can still claim that this is one of the best movies ever made, not just because of Rose's screenplay but also because of the outstanding cast (Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Lee J Cobb, E.G. Marshall and of course Henry Fonda to mention a few).

'12 Angry Men' takes place in almost only one room, but still it is so far from boring. It was Sidney Lumet's first movie for the cinema, and it looks like that he already then had as much or even more experience and knowledge than any other director.

The TV-remake from 1997 is suppose to be good, but I don't think it can match this version even if it contains some real good, heavy names such as Jack Lemmon and George C Scott. Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" is perhaps one of the most perfect movies ever done, I can't find any real weak spot in it. With this movie, Henry Fonda won much respect from me.

Rating: 10 of 10.",10
9 March 2018,The film leaves a tremendous impact,"This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect. This classic is a scintillating courtroom drama with an excellent script and a brisk pace. It's all the more important considering it came just before the social upheaval in the 60's, when America began to reevaluate its prejudices.

2 April 2013,what a movie should be.....!!!,"I was on a desperate search for classics and my friend gave me this film and he told me a movie can't be classier. I was really fascinated by this simple film. The movie deals with the varying viewpoints of 12 jurors on a murder case. Only one juror feels that the accused is not guilty and he goes against the other 11 with a handful of evidences against their theories. Believe it or not, 90 percent of the film is shot in a single room. You won't find elaborate sets, skimpily clad girls or any high octane action, but what you are going to find is the stellar performance from all the 12 angry men and a very subtle yet edge of the seat thriller. It once again proves the point that the success of any film relies on the performance of the actors and more importantly a furnished screenplay. There is never any dull moment in the entire movie. If you miss this movie you have missed one of the best films ever made, period.

16 January 2001,This film should be taught to children in schools,"Anybody in the world who wants or needs to learn something about the concepts of justice, democracy, freedom of speech, fighting against prejudice, reasoned thinking and plain common sense, should see this film. Which means that everybody in the world should see this film. And not just once, but every so often, so that we can keep reminding ourselves of how important these ideas are for a human society to work. Because, using the metaphorical space of a jury room, this is what this film talks about. Many others do as well, but none can reach the viewer as convincingly, with the power, the directness and heartfeltedness of ""12 Angry Men"". And that is simply because it is so unbelievably good.

This is a masterpiece on not only one but two accounts: Artistically, as the perfect script, the perfect cast and the perfect direction simply cannot be improved upon; the film grips you from the first ballot count to the last minute with such vice-like grip that you almost feel like you are right there sitting in the room with the jurors; and ideologically, as this unsurpassable quality and capacity to absorb the viewer gives it the strength to drive home a moral lesson worthy of a Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela speech. I hope one day this film will stand alongside ""Catcher in the Rye"" and the like in children's school syllabuses the world over, as I consider it one of the great Works of Art of the century and essential viewing for any person who wants to improve his or herself.",10
19 October 2011,They don't make classics like these anymore!,"I guess the message of this movie is timeless, especially in the modern world, in this modern times. So I am republishing it. For all the Journalism and Mass Comm student, no make it, for everyone who is with even a little but of a democratic mind set, this movie is a must watch.

I was doing a case study in my Mass-Communication class, when I came upon an old 1957 movie named ""12 angry men"". Who would have thought that a monochromatic film about a Spanish boy accused of murder, and the dilemma of the Jury could be such an experience? ""12 angry men"" was such a lucid, tense, and strangely realistic thriller.

The story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's (Henry Fonda) doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury. While the film itself points out that democracy and all its human participants are flawed in nature, it upholds the values of democracy, probably in a way which is very much apt to the time. The jurors were named after numbers, very much in sync with ideal democracy, and the photography, being black and white, heightens the tension.

Taking place in almost entirely a jury room, the film was very economical, 12 angry men watches as 11 jurors, convinced of the boys guilt, are slowly won over by one man sympathetic enough to at least looking into the matter, and having reasonable doubts before sending a man to die..the tagline of the movie sums it up...""life in their hands, death on their minds"". The screenplay, happening almost entirely in a single room, in a hot summer afternoon, adds on to the claustrophobia, and rather being confining and acts as a tension and drama building measure.

The film leaves a tremendous impact, and leaves a person wondering, about the inevitability as well as the futility of democracy. Check it out folks, they don't make classics like this anymore...",
11 December 2014,One of the best old movies,"Even being such an old movie..It never bores you...I loved the way the movie proceeds...It's got a good pace and actors played their roles effectively...This movie is one of those movies which proves that to make a good film you don't need to have large budgets or beautiful locations you just need a good script...This movie only had 12 characters and a courtroom to make to film it...and it s in itself a marvelous a achievement...The film grabs your attention from the start and makes you think how one person is gong to change the mind of 11 other people in such a short time and during this journey of manipulating minds there are sufficient amount of twists and clever inferences to find clues out of small details will just blow your mind...It is a must watch movie because of its intelligent script and great performance by all the cast...

7 February 2016,If you have never watched a black and white film- watch this,"Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" was my first experience of the wonder that is black and white film. The movie is a true classic and rivals many of today's much higher budget action filled flops. The plot line is simple yet elegant; in the way it portrays one mans defiance to social pressure and compliance.

The movie is one of great significance to film itself. The actors are able to portray the emotions going through jurors minds with extreme precision, and the camera position is well placed throughout the movie.

Well worth watching, especially if you have never once seen a black and white movie ever before.

3 September 2018,Better than most the colored movies I have watched,"It's really black and white, When I first saw this movie on the top rated movies in IMDb I just said it's overrated movie looking at its production date ,dude who in the hell Know i would have watched an 1957 black and white movie. I have not a single problem with it since I have watched the bluray version,the tense story have made me forget its black and white. It's absolutely a masterpiece but it's a bit disappointing that they did not show us anything outside the main room like a lot of main characters they just talked about without showing them to us in the end. That's my opinion and thank you.

29 September 2016,"great movie, great actors, all-time classic","This is a very good kind of theatrical movie, it has great actors, a serious plot, and gives a lot to think about. I can't say that I enjoy watching trials on screen (like, I really love ""To kill the mockingbird"", but it isn't for the trial scenes, however dramatic and well-played). Regardless of that, I will sit down to watch this movie again, just for the big ideas behind it, and the great play of actors. The movie is all about the hasty choices we make about somebody else's lives, because we want to carry on with our own, we rush things and can end up sending someone to the ""chair"" with our hastiness. Luckily, in this jury on screen there was one man who was willing to say ""wait, is there really evidence enough to send this man to the chair, and do so right away, without even considering some possibilities of his innocence?"" There turn out to be so many possible ways in which the witnesses could be interested in giving false evidence that in the end it strikes you atrocious that the other 11 men wanted to send the (probably) innocent boy to the chair. And again, if it wasn't for another man to doubt the boy's guiltiness (the old man, who said member of the jury number 8 ""wanted support, so I gave it to him""), nothing would come out of it. Yet, he switched because he also wasn't 100% certain of the crime being the convicted boy's doing. The most astonishing was to hear the ""I will kill you!"" said by one of the members of the jury to another, and that I think owing not only to the agitated state of the jurer (who had his hear in the matter, because of the relationship with his son). I think it was to make the plot more dramatic, and obviously give evidence that a shout like this cannot necessarily mean that one carries out the stated intention. Speaking of the member of the jury who wanted to punish his son through the convict's death, I found that very convincing. His character and his play was believable, corroborated with his cynical words in the beginning: ""I think those bastards need to be dealt with before they cause any trouble. Save us time and money."" And his position as the last one to switch, the most stubborn, and the one that took this case the most personally is logical. Dostoevsky once said that one cannot send anyone to death for killing. He explained that by the difference in the feelings of a person strangled to death by mercenaries, and the person being put to death by the court. According to him, the victim of a sudden attack always has hope when he is dying, until the very last minute. And hope is taken away from the person that is murdered for the murder of another, legally. I do not know if I agree, for there are very serious cases. But that is something to think about, something related to this great movie.",
27 September 2021,All the adjectives have been used ALREADY !,"No CGI .. no car chases .. no unknown ""stars"" or ""starlets"" .. no elaborate settings .. and no sex ! Just great acting and intelligent script. Hopefully no one in Hollywood will ever decide to make ""12 Angry Men 2 "" one day ....

I still don't understand WHY this film did NOT win an Oscar ? That year's winner couldn't have been THAT good !!

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",6

18 February 2023,Hardest movie I ever had to review.,"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.

* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.

* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography

... and that's about it.

But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.

* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.

* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.

* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics"".

In conclusion, your honor, I think we need a recount here.

5 sounds perfect: did i like it? Did I not? You'll never know.",5
24 August 2001,Absolutely engrossing!,"A film you wish wouldn't end! Excellent acting by all involved, especially Fonda. While it is a courtroom drama set in a jury room, in a lot of ways it is also a detective story, as the jurors try to piece together what exactly happened the night of the murder and find out it isn't as clear cut as they thought in the court room. 12 Angry Men shows how people from different backgrounds and with different personalities view justice, and how those opinions come out in the confined space of the jury room. Even after watching it and knowing what the verdict will be, you'll want to see it again in the future for the great interaction between the characters. The authentic locations add to the inherent realism; you can feel almost feel the heat and humidity in the jury room. Turn up the air conditioning and enjoy this movie!

14 October 2004,Superb,"Seen this one 12 times now - and never tire. Perfect acting - perfect script - superb economical ballet of juror prejudices and revelations. No2 to Shawshank in my book.....

Claims that this is too liberal in outlook bear witness to the polarisation in US politics today. 12AM stands up against bigots, racists and ignorance. If this is liberal - then shouldn't we all be liberals? Fondas character represents everything that could be great about the united states. Sad to say the America of today is more represented by the other members of the jury.

Today there is no room for ambiguity. Those courageous enough to be publicly un-certain - are mocked. This is a recipe for extremism. This is how innocent people die.

12 May 2020,Knife's Edge,"Visual poetry from beginning to end, from a knife fixed to the table giving the impression of standing precariously on its edge, to the rings of sweat on our characters that grow larger with the tension. This innovative courtroom drama not only gives you the fascinating crime solving aspect, but includes thought provoking discussions of society and our places in it. This 60 year old film brings up still relevant issues; classism, toxic masculinity, prejudice against immigrants, etc. It leaves us confronted with our tendency to choose violence and judgment over mercy and empathy. The vision of Lumet combined with Rose's writing creates a marriage of a perfect piece of theater that withstands the test of time.

This kind of movie makes people feel the most important, warmest and most promising things in human nature. Whenever life should be valued, this is the spirit of law, and this is also the embodiment of human civilization.

28 September 2012,So good it belongs in a time capsule,"A man has been brutally murdered and now the life of his eighteen-year-old son, the prime suspect for his killing, is in the hands of twelve jurors. At first glance, it's an open-and-shut case: two witnesses supposedly saw and heard him do it; he had a clear motive; and he even owned an identical knife to the murder weapon. Yet, while eleven jurors are completely convinced of his guilt - some because of the sheer weight of evidence and others due to their own personal prejudices - one man (Henry Fonda) is not. He does not necessarily believe the defendant to be innocent; he simply isn't sure of his guilt. Alone, ridiculed and under intense pressure to conform, he must persuade his fellow jurors one by one that all is not as it seems.

The scene is set for a fascinating cinematic study of the human condition and, arguably, the most gripping film ever made.

I meant to review 12 Angry Men for my university paper two years ago, but never got around to it. Now, having recently completed my first stint of jury service, I believe the time couldn't be more apt for me to right this small injustice. For Sidney Lumet's directorial debut, with its perfect acting, intriguing plot and technical mastery, symbolises for me all that is good about Hollywood cinema, but which we rarely get to see.

Based on Reginald Rose's teleplay of the same name, 12 Angry Men takes place almost entirely within a drab and claustrophobic deliberation room. There are no set changes and little in the way of action; only gorgeous, clinical dialogue. In a genuine feat for 1957, however, Lumet's camera glides effortlessly around this room, making it appear far bigger than it truly is; indeed making it seem as if you yourself are walking around it, like the jurors tasked with deciding a man's fate.

For the classicists reading this, the film adheres to the unities of time, space and action, with film-time closely mirroring audience-time, a detail that yet again transports us against our will inside that room. Lumet also presents a Moby-Dick-esque 'self-enclosed universe', in that each juryman represents a specific human trait: anger, meekness, indifference, compassion - the best of humanity and the worst. It is a film replete with close-ups of human faces, as if the director is constantly trying to see what lies behind them.

What at first appears to be a simple story of revenge is gradually and ingeniously deconstructed by Fonda's character until the audience doesn't quite know what to believe by the end. Every time we think we've reached the bottom of the mystery before us, new depths reveal themselves, until all we're left with is multiple pictures of the truth taken from confusing angles, rather than a single definitive image.

Fonda is imperious as the white-suited knight of justice, fighting bigotry (the defendant's ethnicity is left ambiguous) and ignorance at every turn on his quest to discover the truth. What might entertain you even more than his rhetoric, however, is the detailed characterisation on show throughout - twelve men who are utterly believable and who all have their own unique motivations for voting ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"".

Aside from Fonda, notable performances come from Lee J. Cobb (The Exorcist), who plays the antagonistic Juror #3, and Joseph Sweeney, an actor whose IMDb profile page doesn't even include a photograph, but who is sublime as the elderly yet highly observant Juror #8. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay to this film is to say that there isn't a single average performance in it. Good as the actors are, however, they are helped massively by Rose's acidic script, memorable monologues, and one-liners that are so incisive they'll leave you stunned to silence.

On that note, I can't think of a film that has as many genuinely surprising moments as 12 Angry Men.

12 Angry Men is not devoid of humour - indeed it contains several amusing characters who provide much comic relief - but it is first and foremost an intellectual, psychological and, dare I say it, philosophical film that has been teaching us about ourselves for over 50 years now. It really belongs in a time capsule; it certainly deserves a place in your movie collection.",10
11 December 2022,Jury nullification,"A fictional story story about ""jury nullification"", and confirmation bias. It's an example of the refusal of a jury to find a defendant guilty, even when the facts establish guilt, because that conviction would be contrary to some other concept of justice.

The defendant stabbed his father during an argument. There's physical evidence and testimony. Yet the jury plays amateur CSI, and weaves ridiculous stories about their own lives to justify an acquittal.

This movie shows you the flaws of a jury system, and how one bully on a jury panel can dominate an outcome arguing ""what if's"" and making up scenarios.

1 September 2001,Sidney Lumet: Political Filmmaker,"I realized, watching ""12 Angry Men,"" what an intensely political film it is. The term ""ahead of its time,"" is one I try to avoid, since no person, whether artist or businessman, is ahead of their time. They are, inextricably, unavoidably, a part of their time. But this is a film made in 1957--that's a pretty long time ago, culturally speaking--and it's still inarguably timely. The lead character, Henry Fonda (Juror #8), tries to force people out of making a decision based solely on race and personal convenience. The jury is deliberating a murder conviction, a young immigrant accused of stabbing his father, with ample circumstantial evidence that any ""good"" citizen could stand by if they needed to justify their vote. Most of the jury member want to get the decision over and done with hastily; they have personal errands on their minds, games they want to watch, people they prefer to see. And it's hot that day, very hot--air conditioning is not an option. Under these conditions, Fonda asks much of his fellow jurors: he asks them to put aside thier usual concerns for their own schedules; he demands that they dislodge many years of easy prejudices corroding their judgment; he pleads that they take the time to try and reconstruct other people's points of view, something most of these men clearly don't make a habit of. It's poignant toward the conclusion, after the men leave the courthouse, when one man admiringly asks Fonda his name. They exhange surnames, and then part, realizing either that they're incapable of small talk with each other after such a momentous moral experience--or perhaps that they have nothing in common now that they've emerged into the light of day.

I don't think Lumet is viewed as political filmmaker as he truly is. ""12 Angry Men"" was his film debut, an astonishing accomplishment. But think of many of his subsequent films: a documentary on Martin Luther King's journeys; ""Serpico,"" which charts the crusade of a copy compelled to question an entrenched system that wasn't working very well; the ""Pawnbroker,"" is another powerful film, about how a concentration camp survivor tries to avoid dealing with the moral complications of the outside world once he's back in it; ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a character who is fed up with not having enough money for all the human responsibilities pulling at him. The protagonists in these films are all people that confront or have confronted systems of discrimination, be they racial or economic. And there is nothing more political than examining tyrannies. It's a brave body of work, one to be admired, and ""12 Angry Men"" is a great place to start.",
4 February 2010,An American Masterpiece,"This is a true undeniable American masterpiece. Courtroom dramas rarely match Sidney Lumet's film. The story is about 12 jurors on a murder trial that turns out to be much more complicated than first thought, all thanks to the persistence of Juror 8 played wonderfully by Henry Fonda. This is an hour and a half of gripping, engrossing drama. Prejudice, society classes are just some of the themes that run through the movie from start to finish. These characters are so well written that by the end of this movie you will feel as you must have encountered them at some point in your life. This realness makes 12 Angry Men even the more powerful and thought-provoking.

When this film came out in 1957, Sidney Lumet main input was limited to TV shows and series. Working on 12 Angry Men was not that much different, Sidney Lumet did not use any sophisticated material or expensive locations, he relies here on the power of the screenplay and dialogue and the strength of an all star cast headed by the great Henry Fonda. Limitations that only add to the sheer power of 12 Angry Men.

12 Angry Men is a must-see masterpiece, it is one of the best films of its time and genre, it will capture your attention and make you sit down and think long after you finish watching, it also rewards multiple viewing. Now if those qualities don't make a good movie, I don't know what does.",8
5 November 2002,"NO SPECIAL EFFECTS, JUST SPECIAL ACTING","I love watching movies from 1957. Beside the fact that this was the year I was born, there were some great movies from that year. ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" is one and ""12 Angry Men"" is another. No special effects, no lavish sets, no tropical backdrops. ""12 Angry Men"" depends on real acting and intellegence for success. A open and shut case brought to the jury room for quick debate, is set in a stark, black and white setting. Most of the movie takes place in a small, plain room, with no air conditioning. Not exactly the formula for a entertaining movie. But the cast, led by Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb, bring color and intensity to the screen. Unlike so many movies of today, filled with physical violence and explosions, this movie is filled with verbal sparring and explosions from within the heart. Watching the movie, I felt like I was closed in that small room with the jurors. The movie has the feel of being shot in a couple of hours, instead of the weeks it actually took. This is remarkable because the scenes seem seemless. The movie was a bomb in 1957, but compared to today's formula of sex, aggresion and rock and roll, ""12 Angry Men"" is a blast from the past. It is 'the bomb!'",10

16 October 2021,A Perennial Classic,"12 Angry Men (1957) Dir. Sidney Lumet

""Facts may be colored by the personalities of the people who present them.""
Reginald Rose


Courtroom dramas seldom grace our screens. But when they do, they make sure to leave a fierce impact on our minds.

To be blunt, there haven't been many of this kind in the post-classic era; at least not as good as Sidney Lumet's first-class '12 Angry Men' of 1957. With Henry Fonda as the lead, the film exudes quality and confers a piece of art way, way ahead of its time. Be it the writing, act, or screenplay, Reginald Rose endowed us with an inch-perfect monumental classic.

The story puts the center stage on the verdict of the jury comprising of 12 members having contrasting perspectives on the accusation faced by an 18-year-old boy with the charges being the murder of his father in cold blood. How it pans out throughout its short runtime of 95 minutes at the same time forcing your undivided attention is a remarkable achievement.

With the story not pleading for any external brilliance apart from the characterization of Henry Fonda, the compellingly rousing script illustrated that it's plentiful for a movie to be cited as a masterpiece. The renditions of the actors are so shrewd that the notion that it's been made in 1957 blows our senses out of proportions.

'12 Angry Men' is just the kind of film that has the right to demand your token of appreciation for its unsophisticated making, brilliant acting. Indeed an elegant work, frame by frame, act by act.",9
11 September 2009,school play...awesome! I'm excited...,"we are doing this play in my high school for our fall play, but instead of Twelve Angry Men, it will be Twelve Angry Jurors, so that women can have parts. I think that this will be a really awesome play. i have seen the movie and loved it, and i have also read the actual script of the play. It is excellent and on a very high level for high school though our school always does AMAZING but challenging musicals and plays. am i the only one who thinks that we'll do a good job..? last year we did The House of Blue Leaves, a very challenging yet wonderful play, and the year before we did You Have the Right to Remain Dead. In the current play this year, i will be playing juror #8. i auditioned for this part. i think this is ONE of the best black and white movies i've seen, and i'm 14 years old!

4 May 2000,George Voskovec Rules!!,"I've seen this movie over a dozen times, it's near the top of my Ten Best List. In my humble opinion, it has the best cast ever assembled, of ANY motion picture, EVER. Anyone seriously interested in acting needs to watch this film and takes notes from (among others): Lee J. Cobb, Ed (""Know what I mean??"") Begley, Robert Webber, Martin Balsam, and most of all, George Voskovec, who is truly the master of subtlety and deliniates his character perfectly. I won't echo the praises of my fellow reviewers before me, but I just want to say that the cathartic experience 12 Angry Men offers just can't be beat. Anyone who has seen this masterpiece knows what I'm talking about.

Considering the other jurors thought that it was an open and shut case as soon as they entered the juror room to vote. There were so many distinct and different personalities in all the jurors; that's what made the movie so interesting. There are not many 1950 movies that got my attention like this one. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and kept me thinking all the way through the movie. (Was he guilty or not?) I like how Fonda stayed with his instincts about the flaws in the witness's testimony all the way through the movie. I also like how the director made it seem like you're the 13th juror. It had the camera at everyone's eye level around the juror table to get the feeling that you're in the room with them, it really gets you involved. Even though the movie is half a century old; it's still as relevant today as it was fifty years ago. I'm sure there is juror rooms today that go through the same kind of controversy as the movie did. And that is why I give the movie an 8/10.",8
16 June 2002,"Excellent Acting, Incredible Story","This is one of the best movies ever made. I found it incredibly captivating from start to finish. What I liked most about 12 Angry Men are the characters. Talented actors and the great director Sidney Lumet brought them to life.

I think the most powerful scene was when Henry Fonda's character pulls out the knife and throws it onto the table. I almost got up from my chair just like the rest of the jurors.

I've been watching dozens of classics in recent months, and 12 Angry Men is the best pre-1972 movie that I've seen.

The 1997 remake is supposed to be very good as well. I can't wait to see it but I can't imagine it to be as good as this version.

I rated this movie 10 out of 10.",9
16 February 2003,A little bit of all of us in this film.,"To me one of the things that makes a film a good one is how much it makes you think and how much you find yourself discussing it afterwards. My wife and I spent a great deal of time following the film discussing it. What makes this film so good is that it reveals so much of what we are as individuals and the prejudices that we carry. What else it shows is how much passion that can be expressed during arguments. Think about a big argument you had with someone. Remember how you passionately tried to persuade them how WRONG they were and how RIGHT you were. In passionate argument logic can sometimes get thrown to the wayside. This film has that and you can see yourself in these characters. You get to see how rediculous it can get when you argue a point without solid reasoning. Again, that is what made this film so good for me. You can analyze it so many ways. This is definitely worth the investment of time to see. For provacative thought and excellent acting I give this film 8 of 10 stars.

3 February 2005,Subtle and Paced Well,"As for the previous man's post regarding the lack of cinematic pyrotechnics in this films, I'd like to mention that I thought the means with which this story was told was actually quite brilliant. Sure, there are dated elements to the dialogue and we've come quite a long way technologically with which to please the visual sense. Further it seems that our ""eyes"" have grown accustomed to jump cuts and when they are lacking, well, it's sort of like the analogy of a fast food meal versus a sit down dinner. While a burger and fries are fine, even fantastic at times, it sure ain't a meal you'll never forget. With films like this you have to slow yourself down and appreciate the manner with which it is told. Thoughtful framing and movement of camera subconsciously underscore the message. And ultimately a good story told well is all I ask for from a movie, regardless of frills and CG. I liked it.

30 December 2004,Fonda's on a winner,"This is easily one of the best courtroom drama's you could ever watch. A mighty directional debut for Sidney Lumet, who was also associated with such memorable films as; Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon and Network. It's a story about 12 jury members deliberating on the fate of an 18 year old boy (on trial for the murder of his father). One man stands alone (Henry Fonda) trying to convince the other 11 not to be so hasty with a guilty verdict. It's quite amazing how the story unfolds by only verbal context, there's no flash backs on what went on in the courtroom or the presumed scenario of the murder. All is done by script alone and to this basis the viewer has to pay particular attention. The cast is superb, not big stars at the time, but in later years very well known. I was intrigued with the 12 characters, each one of them a different personality who come from a different walk of life. They were all strangers, the viewer is never told of any of their names, only at the end we hear the surnames of juror # 9 and juror #8 This film gives a indispensable lesson in characterization there's so much to like about 12 Angry MenI highly recommend it. 10/10",10
1 October 2011,Unrhetorical discussion,"After ""Pulp Fiction"",this was the movie which I really respect for DIALOGUES.As this is actually a very old movie I only saw it recently--- when my craze for watching old movie started.I had only seen melodramatic old Indian movies and decided to mitigate my broken mind by not watching old movies anymore.But after watching 12 angry men,my excitement for watching old movies bolstered to a great extent! I actually watched it manly for the rave reviews it had received.I realized that this is the movie which inspired,many recent movies based on murder trials.When I started watching the movie,I was actually skeptical about how the movie would proceed,if it were to be confined to a single room!!The development of the first ten min of the movie----- from the 12 jury men sitting in the courtroom hearing the case to how they start the discussion about the case in the jury room----- was actually one of the simplest,but the most realistic sequence I had seen!I mean especially to find it in a old movie was actually surprising.The way the jury members sweating due to the scorching heat,was shown in a very authentic manner.

Based on the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose,the story is how one the jury members(Henry Fonda) convinces the rest of the 11 members that the murder trial under the discussion is not as simple as it seems.The movie then develops with conversations about how the case is discussed and sorted out!Frankly my verbiage is not enough to describe the brilliance in development of the plot!!As movie proceeds,the screenplay not just depicts a murder case,but also depicts the beautiful sketching of each of the characters.The way the argument proceeds with the infusion of their mindsets to the case is so realistic that,you at some point might feel that the screenplay was written by the screenplay writer actually sitting in a real jury room!!The camera work is simple,but exclusive especially in depicting various erratic emotions of each person.I personally felt that the performance of Lee J Cobb as the short tempered and intransigent jury member was the best!!His anger depicted was like watching my father shouting at me!!!!!

So finally thanks to Sydny Lumet for his thought provoking direction.It is,according to me, his best movie till date.The true meaning of an HERO is very well defined in this film!Henry Fonda not only should be just appreciated for his acting,but should also be haled as an iconic hero portraying aggressive candor and calmness.So please watch this movie mainly for the simple,but taut screenplay.Lastly I do not mean to offend old Indian movies,its just my opinion.If not for the melodramas of those times,I don't think our culture would have been preserved till now.",

23 November 2015,"12 Angry Men, 1 Fantastic Man","In Sidney Lumets classic masterpiece, 12 Angry Men, starring Henry Fonda as Juror 8, tells the story of a jury's decision for a Young Latino Man convicted on murdering his father. The Jury, filled of the 12 Angry Men, then vote, discuss and debate whether this boy is guilty and whether he should face the Electric Chair.

Firstly, all praise has to go to the minimal Cast. There may be few, but those few actors perform some of the greatest performances of All Time. Henry Fonda stars as Juror 8/The Architect, the member of the Jury who wants to convince the rest of his Jury's Peers that the man is not automatically guilty because he's Latino. Henry Fondas fine performance is very memorable, and his character is very lovable. One of the great things about 12 Angry Men is the great display of character development. The change of the Jurors is breathtaking and some of the greatest character development in Film History.

The Film, completely in black and white, asks a very important question. Should someone be guilty because of a stereotype? The Film deeply explores the questions that come up about stereotypes, and how stereotyping can make someone choose a bad decision. The film shows how prejudice is a lethal trait, and how holding onto the past can make you make bad decisions in the present.

12 Angry Men deserves all the praise it can get, and if you disliked it the first time, I recommend a second viewing, and watch out for character development and how prejudice affects decisions.",10
8 December 2018,May be The best thriller till now,"No chases, No big conspiracy theory nor any big mystery(!), Only twelve(!) characters.. Only one room. Yet keeps you on edge the whole time..

And i guess, it makes a better thinker out of you too...

**My experience.*** Had my year final next morning... Thought, will just watch first few minutes... Did even notice where my 1.5 hours went.. (After that it was pointless to stop there)

This is my first review... Thought i would share my experience on facebook, then remembered too many family members there... :3 So writing here instead.. :3 :v

21 April 2013,Amazing plus Awesome!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
16 March 2005,A pure mix of human characters,"I saw it in an 8th grade Civics class and it has been my all time favorite film ever since. Most court dramas show you the trial, the lawyers, the witnesses, and the verdict. This takes a trial from a unique prospective, from the jurors who actually make the decisions. It runs the full range of human personalities. Juror 1 was thrust into the position of foreman; he struggles to lead as near chaos seems to erupt around him. Juror 2, a small weak individual who gets kicked around for most of the film. Juror 3 appears to have no personal feelings in the case, but frequently loses his temper. Juror 4, a cold, endifferent, arrogant stock broker who doesn't even sweat, practically a robot. Juror 5 came from the same background as the defendant and is desperate to appear unbiased. Juror 6, a simple construction worker who wants to see justice done. Juror 7, the class clown of the jury, appears to know right frome wrong, but just wants to get to the baseball game on time. Juror 8, the central character, a passionate, progressive thinker who believes in the power of one individual. Juror 9, a wise old man who brings a unique prospective to the case. Juror 10, white trash, pure and simple. Juror 11, a foreign immigrant who believes in truth, justice, and the American way. Juror 12, a business man who at times finds himself in over his head. It may be possible to predict how one of these personalities might vote, but this film shows that you cannot predict how they will interact with each other and how this interaction will affect the outcome.",10
21 March 2020,Awsome,"From the moment the camera scans the jury you start to build a picture of the characters, in fact the judge before that sums up the feeling in the in the court room. You can watch this film dozens of times and still pick up things you missed previously.

30 April 2023,Deserving of legendary status,"I'm writing this review probably 40 years after first seeing this wonderful film, and having watched the film many times since that first watch. The enjoyment never wanes, and it remains my favourite film from the 1000s I have seen.

The story line is brilliant in its simplicity; a young hispanic lad from the poor side of town is tried for the murder of his father, and his fate is in the hands of 12 male jurors. Almost immediately we are taken to the Jury Room to witness the arguments that unfold, and that's where we will stay until the film's conclusion. All but one of the Jurors has no doubt about the guilt of the accused and are ready to 'send him to the chair', but one has some doubt - just enough to delay the inevitable guilty verdict for while longer. He just thinks they should at least talk about it before rushing to a verdict - a young life is at stake after all.

What follows in a masterful reveal and unravelling of each character in the Jury through the reviewing of critical evidence, key witness statements, arguments and confrontations. Allegiances and opinions are swayed, prejudices and flaws are exposed, and justice is examined. All set within one increasingly claustrophobic room and with gripping intensity and intelligence. Special effects and mood music are not required here; the drama is delivered in bucket loads through wonderful casting, superb camera work, marvellous dialogue and fabulous acting.

Henry Fonda (as Juror 8) gives a fine performance as the man who initially questions the decisions and motives of the other jurors, but the other 11 characters are certainly not short-changed. All deliver fine performances, with Lee J Cobb probably the pick of them as the emotionally-charged and aggressive Juror 3.

I am delighted that this outstanding film continues to rank so highly on imdb; it is fully worthy of it.",10
27 August 1999,"Very simple, yet very brilliant","""12 Angry Men"" is one of my few very favorite classic films. It has a great dialogue, especially the arguments between #3 (Lee J. Cobb) and #8 (Henry Fonda). The setting might be a bit atrocious, but the atmosphere and the tension between the men make up for the droll backdrop. Cobb has probably the best role there, because he really fights for his right to accuse the defendent of guilty and to shove the young punk into the electric chair, while Fonda also does great as he struggles to convince everyone else to find the reasonable doubt for the defendent. The direction of the movie is excellent to compare with the performances. It's very tight, yet it adds to the gloomy atmosphere inside a humid jury room. Put simply, ""12 Angry Men"" should have won best picture '57 all the way. A lot of people would agree with me.

27 July 2015,more than drama,"Please read the rest of the reviews, which make excellent points about social issues, casting, cinematography, scripting, and the directness and force of pure simplicity.

Fonda and the switchblade.

Cobb and his son's picture.

My point, which addresses something more subliminal, is that this is a great detective story. How enjoyable to watch tensely as the clues are put together, not logically, but haphazardly yet effectively as in real life investigations.

12 Angry Men is seldom broadcast. Watch it every time it is.

27 August 2006,The best trial drama,"A trial is held, the accused being a boy who is suspected to have killed his father. We don't see how the crime was committed, instead we hear how it happened a little bit at a time when the juries are talking.

At first, all juries seem convinced that the boy did murder his father. They all vote on guilty except one jury who seems to think otherwise. He comes up with logical theories that slowly turns other juries' opinion on whether the boy could really have committed the murder.

Juror #8's theories prove that the court's decisions can always be wrong, no matter how many distinguished and intelligent people have worked on the case. The conviction of the boy by other juries show how easily people can be swayed and follow general public's opinion even the juries. Juror #8's analytics of the case ultimately show us that anything done by humans can always have errors, even when a life of a human being depends on the cost of the errors.",10

3 September 2016,Lumet's Finest,"Lumet's staggering courtroom drama 12 Angry Men mostly takes place in the cramped jury room where a dozen ""men with ties"" decide the fate of Puerto Rican teenager accused of murdering his abusive father. Yet the prologue to their civic imprisonment, which takes place beyond these confined walls, sets the stage for Lumet's overarching concerns about the contradictions of the democratic process. After a few short establishing shots where men, women, and children traverse the plaza steps and interior hallways of the court building, Lumet and director of photography Boris Kaufman focus on a particular door, where one of many cases currently in motion is just about to reach critical mass. The legal arguments have subsided, leaving the courtroom mostly silent and the fate of the accused in the hands of the aforementioned 12 white men. Before their dismissal, the judge looks down at the group and bequeaths them to ""separate the fact from the fancy."" Despite his harsh tone, we quickly realize only one of them takes this statement seriously.

That man is Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting voice during the jury's disturbingly jovial initial vote to convict the boy of first- degree murder, which would send him to the electric chair. Juror 8 has questions, a lot of them that he wants to discuss further, much to the chagrin of his fellow jurors. ""There's always one,"" yells sarcastic Juror 10 (Ed Begley), who, like many of his fellow deliberators, desires a quick conviction so that they can all get back to their regular lives. In the minds of the other 11 men, the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the prosecution, so why even bother with debate. But Juror 8's resistance to such mob mentality and manipulation helps erode the devastating moral righteousness of men like Juror 3 (Lee J. Cobb), whose certainty about the boy's guilt is just one of the many red flags to surface during the proceedings. Slowly but surely, Juror 8 forces each man to look beyond their own prejudices—to question the evidence at hand and to become active participants in the judicial process.

What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion. As this trend becomes more of a factor, each character begins to show their true colors in relation to the case. Whether it's a bit of blatant racism from Juror 10, extreme hatred from Juror 3, or a sobering plea of humanity from Juror 8, Lumet shoots the most important lines of dialogue in close-up, lingering on the characters' faces for extended moments, establishing the importance of proximity and duration when it comes to dramatic shifts in the story. It's almost as if Fonda's character, and Lumet for that matter, believes these men are smart enough to make the correct decision if given the context and time to carefully consider the ramifications of their actions. Despite some crippling character flaws, laziness and apathy are the only real villains here.

Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is a master class in refurbished cinematic space. It takes a confined, almost completely banal real- world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme. Kaufman's fluid long takes track each character as they leave the table in anger and frustration, the men departing for sporadic moments of personal reflection before returning to the heated discussion. Seemingly simple conversations lead to damning assumptions about ideology and purpose, and each man brings their own set of moral baggage to the table. This allows the location to grow in depth as the characters become more fully developed. In turn, the smooth visuals have a strange effect on the narrative itself; they juxtapose a narrative seamlessness of cause and effect with the building uneasiness in each man, creating a volatile and unpredictable feel that rivals the extreme shifts in weather (from sweltering heat to torrential downpour) beyond the juror room windows.

Incredibly, 12 Angry Men was Lumet's feature directorial debut, a fact that remains massively impressive considering the film's meticulous craft and pacing. Harboring just as much compulsive energy and momentum as most modern Hollywood action films, 12 Angry Men makes every shot and line of dialogue count. It's a film immersed in the organic relationship between façade and perspective, how each character tries to hide their own weaknesses by lashing out at others. ""Prejudice always obscures the truth,"" one Juror finally says at the end of the film. As the unnamed men depart and walk down the courthouse steps, it's finally clear that some of them understand how that particularly true statement relates to their own conflicted, ambiguous, and flawed life experience.",10
18 September 2018,A fantastic character central showcase of substance over style,"12 Angry Men is a wonderful demonstration of what can be done when a story is stripped down to its bare essential elements consisting of the dynamics between characters. Each of which is incredibly well conceived considering the large amount of characters which are developed over the course of the film.

17 March 2002,Better than the written play,"I have taught ""12 Angry Men"" in high school literature classes a

few times and I think it is safe to say that the film version is better

than the written play. The characters are more sharply drawn as humans

we can relate to. (Yes, I really teach literature, even though I end

a sentence with ""to"". My 8th grade English teacher would have a fit.)

The dialogue is sharper. And, especially when seeing it several times,

the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers about what

constitutes justice and what is or could be the best possible legal

system. As a movie fan, not a literature teacher, I have the following

comments. In ""12 Angry Men"" Henry Fonda seems to be playing the same

character that he played quite a few years earlier in ""The Immortal

Sergeant"": the seemingly timid, reluctant hero who rises to the

occasion with dogged determination and emerging powers of persuasion.

Even the mannerisms and the phrases he uses in the two films are

similar. In ""The Immortal Sergeant"" he is the corporal and therefore

the ranking member of the squad after the sergeant is killed. When his

squad on patrol encounters an enemy implacement, he proposes to attack

it instead of simply passing it by. (sound like ""Saving Private

Ryan""?) When challenged with someone speaking in an affected British

voice, ""But my dear fellow, what possible effect could our attacking

them have on this campaign?"", Henry Fonda responds, ""Probably none at

all, I don't know. But it seems to me ..... (""our job is to win the

war"")"" In ""12 Angry Men"", Fonda uses the same character to say, ""Well, I

don't have anything brilliant, but ....."" My other observation is that ""12 Angry Men"" has one of the greatest

understated insults of all time incorporated into an etiquette lesson: ""Pardon. But..."" ""Oh, 'pardon, pardon'. What are you being so polite all the time

for?"" ""For the same reason you're not. I was brought up that way.""",

9 January 2000,"Hey, juror #3, LIGHTEN UP!!!","Undoubtedly a true classic, ""12 Angry Men"" is one of the best dramas ever filmed. In this movie, everybody can feel the tension, not just by the jurors themselves, but the viewers as well. Henry Fonda does a great job as the good-hearted juror #8, and Lee J. Cobb is equally great as the bad-tempered eight juror. As juror 8 is trying his best to find the reasonable doubt to spring off the young defendent accused of murder off the guilty seat, juror 3 and a few other jurors want to see the kid hang.



""12 Angry Men"" is practically my favorite old movie (I like a lot of new stuff), because even though its atmosphere is very old-school, its got the same dramatic intensity found in current dramas.

22 April 2003,Courtroom Drama with a difference...,"Ever since I got my fingers burned with ""The Graduate"", I've been just a little wary of films that are considered revered classics on imdb. I didn't need to have any fears about this one!

It really is a courtroom drama with a difference. We don't see the presentation of the case, there is no damning evidence produced at the last minute by sleight of hand, we don't have the oh-so-intense barrister getting the hard-headed witness to crack on the stand (but don't get me wrong, I loved ""A Few Good Men""!)

What I like most of all is that, just like the jury, we don't ever find out if the defendant really is guilty or not.

As a film, this is a work of craftsmanship. As so many have said, when you can't bank on special effects or locations, it's down to great writing and great acting, and this film has both in spades.

It's basically a character study, and a fabulous demonstration of group dynamics. Whatever your preferred genre, this film is a must have your collection.

Dare I say flawless?",9

11 October 2017,But why not?,"This film is a must see. One friend once said ""you haven't seen real cinema till you watch this film"". Now I have to thank him because he was right. How to keep someone during 90 minutes in front of the TV without moving? You can tie him to the sofa, or you can put ""12 angry men"" on the screen. This film is the perfect example of how sometimes greats dialogues and better facial expressions can give much more than other kinds of action. This film is 90 minutes of how the character incredibly well performed by Henry Fonda could not just change the whole jury's mind, but also spectators'. So, my question: why did not this film won the Oscar award?

30 November 2017,A Masterpiece!,"A masterpiece, that's what it is.

Can you imagine such a brilliant concept, acting, and film was made 60 years back. Yes, so many fantastic films were made then. It was one of them. But it has a unique concept/story.

All the actors did absolute justice to their respective characters, and I love all of them. I am just totally killed by such a brilliant movie with such brilliant performers. Among them, Lee J Cobb (Juror-3), and Ed Begley (Juror-10) caught my eyes a bit more as I think they were just simply at top notch. Lee J Cobb got the hardest role full of emotions, laughter, anger and what not and he did it with class and ease. Ed Begley also had a tough role of doing an act of having cold, and look how realistically he delivered that. The honest dedication and commitment of all the 12 actors towards their roles deserve high appreciation. The only thing that I have a slight difference of opinion is about the title of the movie. It is a good title, all right. But there could be another title because Henry Fonda (Juror-8) was not actually an angry man, rather he remained very calm. Same was with jurors-1, 3, 9, and 12. The title could be ""A Pending Decision"" or ""12 Jurors"", or something better.

This film will remain one of my top most favorite films forever.",10
21 November 2022,"Thought I would be bored but boy, I was wrong","Sidney Lumet's 12 angry men it's a perfect example of how beautiful a movie can be if it focusses on the story, characters and conflict. Released in 1957, this courtroom drama is about the complexity of human behaviour even though at first it seems to be just a boring black and white movie.

The entire film takes place in a room where 12 jurors have to decide the fate of a young man who has been accused of murder. At first it seems obvious that he is guilty but juror # 8, portrayed stunningly by Henry Fonda, forces them to carefully consider the evidence before jumping to a hasty verdict. This is where the film sends the message to stand up for what you believe and not settle just because everybody else is. Being very well scripted and focused on it's conflict, the film manages to make every juror fall into a different archetype.

Moreover, 12 angry men makes a commentary about the judicial system and how it's pretty unfair for someone's faith to be in the hands of people of the same race and gender, their verdict being able to be dictated by prejudice or even racism. I think one of the best scenes in the entire movie is the one where juror #10 tries to justify the guilt of the accused by making a racist comment and everyone else turn their backs on him and start ignoring him. Also, another thing that makes this film so gripping it's the attention to details and the way they come up with new ideas, me being a fan of mystery movies I found it really entertaining.

Despite the lack of actual action, 12 angry men is a very captivating and fascinating film and I can only conclude this review by saying it's a must see for everybody. Don't knock it until you've tried it.",10

26 November 2016,Masterpiece,"12 Angry Men is the film that changed my opinion about all black-and- white films. Before this film, I think this type of old films is boring, so I don't ""waste"" my time with these ones. But when I watched this film, I changed all my mind about it.

The film is literally masterpiece. There is no action or mind-blowing parts. All story goes on in one room and the thing is almost everything seems as mystery, but real. The case which our jury have to decide about, jurors, their actions and judgement is so well considered. One of the most interesting parts of the film is that no name mentioned until the very end.

Also it is very hard to shot the whole film only in one place, one room. So crew had done great work. A piece of art. So I think it is the best film to start old and gold films.

26 May 2000,12 angry men: millions of happy viewers...,"Henry Fonda stars in this electrifying drama that takes place almost entirely in a closed jury room. A teenager is on trial for the murder of his father and will get the chair if found guilty. The jury takes an early vote and it seems that Fonda is stands alone in voting ""not guilty."" Now, he has the challenge of trying to win the others over to his side. A tight script and an explosive performance by Lee J. Cobb make this a true classic. Fonda is great as the mild-mannered protagonist to Cobb's fiery antagonist. A great cast fills out the rest of the jury, including John Fiedler, a very young Jack Klugman and Jack Warden, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall, and Martin Balsam as the head juror.

26 May 2012,One of the greatest movies ever? Not really,"Date: 18 May

-First Time Watch-

I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.

28 February 2003,In the Room,"The story of this film is famous: one man tries to convert the 11 other jurors in a jury room. Superficially, that's all the film is. And it works magnificently on this level alone. But mixed in with that one notion (which is, I should say, remarkably carried out), we've got sprinklings of messages. What democracy really means, the notion of a fair and just trial, the stupidity of racism, etc.

At the opening of the film, we're inside the courtroom (everything but the opening and closing -- maybe 120 seconds in total -- takes place within the jury room and its adjacent bathroom) and the judge seems blasé about the jury. ""Just go in and do your thing...whatever."" It's just another case with a fairly predictable outcome, he thinks (we assume). He reminds the jury that their conclusion must be unanimous and as they walk into the jury room, a few of them take a glance at the man on trial and the camera shows his face, looking at his only hope to save him from the chair (he's on trial for murder one).

As the jurors file into the jury room, over the credits, we see Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), who seems uninterested, looking out the window. The others are mostly talking about simply being in a jury room but Fonda is actually thinking about the case. He's slow to move, contemplative. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) is anxious to get out to his baseball game he's got tickets for.

There has been talk, like Roger Ebert's, of how the camera starts out at an elevation and slowly comes down by the end of the film. I didn't notice that, but I did notice just how creative the camera does move about in a very constricted space. I don't think it's ever in exactly the same place, at the same angle.

The first jury count, of course, has them at 11 to one, in favor of guilty. What makes this film great is that the lone man who says not guilty, Fonda, isn't sure the young man on trial is innocent -- he's just not sure he's guilty.

The straight racism of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is obvious and the film deals with it. I don't know what the times were like in 1957, but I would have assumed that the order of the day may be to bring racial issues up but not deal with them directly. This film does and it comes out on the right side. The film isn't dated at all in its politics. If it were made today (I haven't seen the TV remake, although with a cast that has George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, I'd like to), Juror #10 may be less obvious a racist, but this is a minor, if even, a complaint. There are still people like him, who'd believe that murder is inborn to specific ethnicities. What's sort of funny is that I couldn't tell what the man on trial was. Maybe Italian or Greek.

We get a good sense of each of the jurors, and indeed by the end we could probably list them off by their number (they never really say names, it's usually, ""Hey, you there""). Part of this is due to that amazing camera. It really lets us know these people and it doesn't cut back to the ""overview shot"" or something so we can just get a good look at everyone together. When there is a wide shot that shows the entire room, some jurors are up walking, getting a drink, one may be in the bathroom. It's not a condescending camera that says, ""Here's everyone. We'll give you some time to get all of them straight.""

The entire film -- aside from those estimated 120 seconds -- is shot in real time, or as close to real time as you can come without making a film with one continuous, unbroken shot. Within the jury room there are no edits for time lapses, just for cutting to a different angle or juror.

The film acknowledges how evidence is all subjective (""There's a difference between a slap and a punch.""). Each juror saw the same thing in the courtroom (we hear the evidence and the case only through the jurors recollections) but comes out with something different. That's part of what makes movies in themselves great: we all see the same movie and, when one is good, we all leave with something else, specific to us.

Fonda is the leader in the film, almost made into a holy figure. He's passive in the beginning and he's the one who presents the other jurors with his feelings as to why the young man may not be guilty. That's what Fonda does, brilliantly. He talks out his feelings. He's not in possession of some scientific fact that he plans on systematically informing the jury of, he just needs to take some time to sort out the facts, as he heard them, in his mind. Of course he's noticed things the others haven't and he's given the case more thought than maybe most would have. But it isn't a one-man mission. By being the one to stand up, he lets the others come out and say what they've seen. He gives them the chance to think and feel things over. While Fonda is obviously the protagonist, the film doesn't shy away from fairly showing other considered theories of those who are against him. At first Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) is the common sense antagonist, but later Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) has intelligent deductions as to why Fonda is wrong.

All of the technicalities of the film are fine. The acting is first-rate -- I was especially interested in Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), who's made into an almost goofy old man with a strange way of showing his untold wisdom. And I now understand why Henry Fonda appealed to so many. Lee J. Cobb is terrific as the easily angered brute who isn't quite that simple. The picture on the DVD was incredibly crisp.

This is the type of movie they should show in American History classes. Hell, show it in any country (like mine, Canada) where democratic notions are held dear. In this room there is a microcosm of judicial, political, and human existence. A masterwork.

7 June 2023,Against The Tide...,"Director Sidney Lumet's 12 ANGRY MEN is a milestone film. Henry Fonda plays Juror 8, the sole holdout among the other jurors who've already made up their minds about the defendant's guilt. Over the course of time, tempers flare, words get heated, and several hidden motivations are exposed. Mr. Fonda stays calm throughout, while the votes begin to shift in surprising ways.

Mr. Lumet has struck pure gold here, which is all the more impressive considering that this is his first motion picture. His ability to seal these men into a single room, and keep things, not only interesting, but riveting, is astonishing. We can feel the tension, along with the stifling heat that causes them all to gleam with sweat.

Many important issues are tackled, such as: Prejudice, confirmation bias, peer pressure, and integrity.

The supporting cast is almost a who's who of superior character actors, including Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley. The dialogue is intelligent and quick. Even with a cast this big, squeezed into that little room, no one is left out of the debate.

Sidney Lumet is still underestimated as a film maker in the UK, and this is a shame. He seldom fails to hit the mark.

Fonda was a superb actor and the support he gets here from Lee J Cobb and Ed Begley is faultless.

I would recommend that any serious student of cinema, should watch this film to learn how to make a story come to life and how a simple setting and straightforward acting can still make for exciting viewing.",10

1 May 2023,Questions our prejuducial judgement!,"(1957) 12 Angry Men DRAMA/ PSYCHOLOGICAL

Based on the story written by Reginald Rose centering on 12 jurors discussing a case they had just finish hearing involving the conviction of a young Spanish American teenage boy accused of stabbing his dad to death. Viewers are oblivious what the case was about except to know that the boy's life all depends on the hands of the jury with a sentence of either a life or death. Jury #8 played by Henry Fonda becomes the lone juror who thinks the accused may be innocent while the rest of them wanted a guilty verdict. Viewers at first blatantly see it as an open and shut case but as the move progresses, we become convinced ourselves that it may not be what it appears to be. And as juror #8 is striving for his fellow jurors to convince him, he eventually manages to convince each one of them very slowly to reverse their decisions- with reasonable explanation. This is probably the best depiction about how jury's supposed to work since majority of the cases these days are assumed to be stereotypical, prejudice, and personal. Nominated for 3 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing. The jury selection for the Jodi Arias and the Travon Martin case are a big joke which if cameras were allowed during their discussions in regarding to some of those cases, we would be able to witness the examples of prejudices and stereotypical ramblings that exist.",8
28 May 2006,The perfect court drama,"This is the perfect court drama. It involves the struggle of jurors trying to make the right decision concerning the fate of a man. The staging of this classic is shot in one room. Always focusing on the struggle at the time and not cluttering the movie with the externals. It invites us to join struggle that happens once the trill is over. The writing and acting draw us into that conflict. I am particularly enamored over the black and white photography and the one room set. If color had been more widely used at that time, it would have changed the entire feel of the movie. I typically say that one must suspend their disbelief for movies. This is one film that you want to believe absolutely

7 March 2020,Peculiar,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
6 June 2000,"More drama, tension and fascinating psychology than any newer thriller","Henry Fonda's best role. Gripping, dramatic, an extraordinarily powerful film more truthful than any documentary. It is also an important primer on the prime directive of American jurisprudence: that we as a nation prefer that 100 guilty men go free than that a single innocent person be convicted. The concept of ""guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" is nowhere defined in the American legal code or Constitution. This movie does it for us. It also makes clear why no one, not even the President of the United States, may commit perjury without deliberately working to undermine the very basis of our legal system.

10 May 2020,A film in a single room.,"This cult classic showcases us how the jury system works. It shows that 12 jury members who are compete strangers, have different perspectives, comes to a single conclusion and how hard this process can be. In this movie a Puerto Rican youth is accused pf stabbing his father to death. After the trial, the jury members accumulate to discuss whether the boy is guilty or not. Everyone was convinced that the boy was guilty but only after the vote we saw that only one person(Jury 8) voted for not guilty. And this when the mind battle starts, where Jury 8 creates some doubts about the incident as well as the people who appeared as witness. This movie shows that how a case which seems so simple can be a lot complex.

21 March 2020,The best one ever,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.

17 June 2021,Cult Classic Drama to watch,"This movie is based on art of arguing as a subject . Not at all a mainstream entertainment cinema to watch , totally dialogue based movie . The whole screenplay of this movie is confined to only one room and 12 men playing the role of jury members . This movie puts the full range of human good and evil on display . Totally based on personality conflict , dialogue and body language . Overall this film leaves a tremendous impact.

17 April 2023,12 Angry Men,"Twelve jurors are sent to their deliberating room after hearing the evidence in a murder trial. It's potentially the hottest day of the year as this collection of white, male, individuals take their seats around the table and wait for foreman Martin Balsam - none of the characters have names, here - to call them to order. A first vote is in order - it's a slam dunk - the accused is obviously guilty - 11-1! Henry Fonda is the dissenter. What has he seen that the others missed? What has he not seen that the others have understood? What now ensues is one of the best written and characterised, compelling, dramas cinema has ever produced. Excellent efforts from Lee J. Cobb, in particular, but from all concerned allow the tension to positively leap from the screen at us. This story gradually fills us in with the details of the crime, with the statements of the witnesses and, initially at any rate, illustrates just how cursorily many of these men treat this case. They want to get home for dinner, for a baseball game, to their wives and children. The fact that they are considering the life and death of an eighteen year old man seems tangential to the inconvenience they are facing or to the value they place on this man's survival. Reginald Rose's original screenplay takes us through the whole gamut of human bigotries and intolerances with everything from ageism, racism, respect and sexism rearing their ugly heads as the tension in their discussions rises and the true nature of these characters starts to emerge. Timidity, assertion, rationality - all are on display as these men start with a position that they may well not end up with. Ninety minutes seems far too short - but it works very well, rarely coming up for air - but what will their verdict be? Big screen if you can. Not because the scenario (a jury room) needs it - but there is so much energy and vitality in this film, that is just the best way to appreciate it a strong cast who put their all into their roles - and it works!",8

I always thought it would be difficult to get involved in the context, I couldn't be more wrong! 12 angry men, is a great example of how a simple film can do magic with good actors, and what great actors they are!

20 April 2020,what a play,"Films made from theater plays have a tendency to lack action and movement, and therefor run the risk of being less than films from scripts that are written solely for the big screen. This play however is so well written, and the actors performing it are so splendid, that this is a film you can watch over and over again without ever being bored. Two remakes followed this one. Although the story remains compelling, this first run at putting it on the big screen still is the best of the three. This film is a true must see. And it has a compelling message as well.

11 March 2014,Wonderful movie - Gets you thinking,"This is a wonderful movie about group psychology and how the behaviour of a group influences an individuals behaviour in spite of his own rationale telling him something else.

It is also a great example of how to resolve conflicts and a great lesson of persuasion.

Entire film is shot in 1 room apart from a couple of scenes in the court room and just outside the court at the end of the film. The intensity in the film rises with each passing minute and it keeps you hooked on until the last minute. The film makes you concentrate from the start to the end without letting you off the hook for a second.

I've watched this movie five times and still cant get enough of it.

Sydney and Fonda take it all the way as we are involved with them in deciding the fate of the kid. A classic that can be enjoyed by all generations.

2 July 2019,"6/10, a hung jury","It feels like a stage play adapted for screen, an interesting story told in real time, with little more than a boardroom setting. A jury debate the fate of a young man accused of murdering his father. It looks to be a cut and dry guilty verdict, but the vote returned, 11-1, is not unanimous, and the lone voice in favour of 'not guilty' spends the rest of the film convincing the others he is right. It highlights the complexities and serendipity of the justice system (in particular the death sentence), and the personal sentiments clouding decisions, and for such a mundane setting, the case remains compelling. Unfortunately it is very contrived. The jury, who have no training in law, appear to make a better case in an hour and a half than the lawyers did in many days. We are supposed to believe its because the lawyers weren't interested in the case. Right. The real answer is because we wouldn't have a movie if they did. Further, one of the jurors breaks conduct by introducing a piece of evidence not presented in court, which should have resulted in a mistrial.

31 December 2007,One of the Best Movies,"More than classifying the movie's Genre as Drama i would rate this movie as Thriller or even Action Movie. The action/thrilling is not with guns or with Knives but with Words.

Actually i considered my self as a Jury member and i got convinced by those points provided by each and every member.

I liked all plots/scenes except one jury who just tries to vote Guilty or Not Guilty only for a Base Ball Match ie the movie concludes with out getting convincing points/ideas for that particular Jury's Stand on why he is voting guilty or not guilty.

All 12 Men have equal part to be played.

I have not even felt boring for a single minute.

The Screenplay is really the diamond over the Crown because it is very tough to make viewers/movie watchers to sit and watch a movie which is made with in a room with 12 people.

16 December 2008,A court movie that lives up to the test of time!,"Plot: A movie about the court system, and much more. From a group of 12 jury members, thinking they have a open cut case of a sure verdict of guilty or do they?

My Spiel: I have slapped this movie in and watched it about as many times as about any other movie I own on DVD. Even though mostly all of this movie except for like 5 minutes are filled in one room, which could be considered a very boring movie, but the take on each of the characters is so great, from there different backgrounds and personalities it makes this movie a true masterpiece and one to be seen again and again. Basically its about one man (Henry Fonda) who thinks one man's life is worth a little more time to considering instead of throwing in a guilty vote with the other 11 in a matter of seconds. From what starts as just lets talk about the trial begins to have a turning effect on the other 11 people, and what ensues is something so amazing!

31 March 2022,It's about Guilty,"The film shows us nothing of the trial itself except for the judge's perfunctory, almost bored, charge to the jury. His tone of voice indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. We hear neither prosecutor nor defense attorney, and learn of the evidence only second-hand, as the jurors debate it. Most courtroom movies feel it necessary to end with a clear-cut verdict. But ""12 Angry Men"" never states whether the defendant is innocent or guilty. It is about whether the jury has a reasonable doubt about his guilt.

15 July 2003,The way a good movie can be made,"This movie has what would be called an ""ensemble cast"" in todays terms, and all of them were powerful actors.

Made on a budget of $500,000 (probably 10 mil in today's dollars), I'm sure nearly all of it went to cast salaries as there was very little else to spend it on, such as sets or locations. The biggest special effect was probably the wide angle close-up on Joseph Sweeney.

This movie is an text-book example of fine acting and character studies. It still holds up well over all this time, too.

Top rated, and reasonably priced for your collection.

10 November 2021,A film that makes you think,"Many old movies like this that get great critic reviews, but don't let that fool you. This isn't just for critics or fans of old movies. I usually like movies genres such as sci-fi, action, thriller, etc, and I still love this movie. It makes you think about what you would do if you were part of the jury, whether you would vote guilty or not guilty, what evidence is most important, so on and so forth. This is also one of the most well-made movies I have ever seen. No second is wasted, everything everyone says and does makes sense for their character, and the acting is perfect. It is simple, in that it all takes place in one room, but great.

9.5/10.

26 September 2015,"Brilliant storytelling, fantastic script.","The human mind is trained to identify good or bad storytelling as one's been told stories one's whole life. 12 Angry Men tells you a story and hits it out of the ball park.

If you ever feel that a 1950s movie will be boring and cannot be compared to the present ones, let me tell you something. I was of the same notion while people urged me to watch this movie and boy was I glad I finally listened to them.

12 Angry Men is a storytelling masterpiece with a fantastic script. It does have great acting but the dialogue and the narrative convinced me that this was the greatest story that was ever told via motion pictures.

If you think old movies are dull and not worth it, just spend 2 hours of your day (preferably uninterrupted) and watch this film, you are going to find a new love for movies.",10

5 October 2007,One of the Best,"I am baffled as to how this film didn't make it on the AFI list of the top 100 movies of the last century. It's great on every level -- the cast is magnificent, and the script and direction are also wonderful. A great showcase, in fact, for great acting and writing, since it's basically twelve people locked in a room, where they talk, persuade and argue about a man's life. Henry Fonda is terrific as the initial holdout, but it's the way that the others come around to his point of view that makes this such a fascinating drama. I won't focus on specific performances because the entire cast was so stellar. Highly recommended.

16 December 2021,One of a kind. A masterpiece.,"This movie is about so many different things. It's touching the subjects of independent thinking, not to judge a book by its cover, humanity and the value of facts. Well, I guess you can even relate it to the wave of fake news in our society today. But for me more than everything else, this movie is a tribute to the american democracy. We see 11 men who change their opinion by the power of strong arguments from Juror #8, and thats exactly what the democratic conversation is about. The idea that conversations and arguments from conflicting sides led to the best possible outcome is a cornerstone of democracy. Therefore, this movie is also about being open-minded and willing to listen to others in order to gain more knowledge.

5 January 2017,classically simple yet...,"A friend asking me to recommend one classic oldie. The first title that popped into my mind was 12 ANGRY MEN (1957). It's not even my favorite, it has no female cast, there are no action scene, definitely no special effect: just 12 men in a room.

But the plot is so riveting you don't even want to pause the DVD for a pipi break. The movie is on the very short list of works defined as 'classical' in the Aristotelian sense for respecting the three unities which make up a classical masterpiece - unity of action, unity of time, unity of place.

The drama was first adapted to the stage and then to the screen in 1957 and 1997; my preference goes to the 1957 version because of the stellar performance given by Henry Fonda, nominated for both a Golden Globe and a BAFTA (won) in 1958.

2 March 2005,Now -- this is Acting !!!,"1957 seems like a life time ago. For many people, it was a time where going to the movies was a regular outing -- today we go to see a particular movie, and only if we just can't wait for the video.

Times may have changed, but people really haven't. Take 12 people with personalities just about as far apart as possible, and put them in one room -- then watch what happens.

One amazing thing is that almost the entire movie is situated within a single room. Just the players, a few tables, three walls and windows.

You may not know all the names, but you should recognize most of the faces of these actors. Great drama, and fun as your emotions roll. Definitely one for the list of must see movies.",9
5 July 2008,Magnificent movie,"This movie is a classic example of how a screenplay should be made. The whole movie take place in a single room and just realize how the director has made the audience to sit and watch. Not even a single scene will make you feel boredom. Also, being a movie in the 50s, you should also analyze the adaptation of the movie. How the gentleman convinces one by one and makes his argument crystal clear, without dealing much about the actual victim. One added advantage in this movie is the dialogue delivery which can be understood by someone who is trying to learn English.

Sheer Brilliance Screenplay.

19 July 2011,Brilliant cinematic masterpiece !,"'12 Angry men' is not the movie if u have prejudice against black n white cinema, its not the movie if u want Tyre-scorching action.....it is only for those movie goers with subtle touch of patience and want can over look obvious looking simplicity......Story is pretty straight forward of jury deciding the fate of a person who looks to be given a swift verdict.......yet a man comes forward and gives a different viewpoint n challenges every juror in a very subtle way to just 'think again'. This is start of movie which really captivated my attention from start to end, it never required beautiful movie set or location.....the unfolding of story was so good that i was glued to the screen and yet at the end i realized the whole film was shot in a single room, no guns or girls, yet i loved the ending and tell you what at the end you only get to know the name of main 'protagonist' of change of opinion........u just don't need such formalities !

Simply put '12 Angry men' showcases 12 'angry' jurors just looking to seal the fate of a person yet 1 person is managed to change perception of all by power of reasoning and convincing all of them one by one to change, what was pretty much done n dusted verdict.....

You will love the movie if u really have in you the patience to sit in front without expecting any melodrama and yet in the end you will feel really satisfied as if u have seen a action pack thriller !. There are very few movies in Hollywood who can match the level of '12 Angry men', 'Sleuth (1972)' comes close to it in a way but i won't tell how.........

A movie for person who can enjoy cinematic brilliance in a very fine,simple and subtle way and not a movie for ludicrous action-pack stuffed movie goers !",
22 April 2004,NO EXPLOSIONS,"I have always loved this movie. I read a review from another subscriber that dissed the newer movies like the LOTR Trilogy. He recommended that many new movie fans watch the old movies. Some young people I know will not watch some movies because they are in black and white. A person that I love has said that it is difficult to watch older movies because you have to pay so much attention to the dialogue. This is really sad because this person is extremely intelligent and reads the classics all the time. I loved when my 22 YO daughter watched Psycho(1960) for the first time a few years ago and was completely fooled having never heard about it. So my friends maybe there is hope. Maybe as time goes on the lure of crashing cars and explosions will be less attractive. The accomplishments of special effects will always be just another facet in the diadem of great movie making.

Nobody has ever done Frankenstein better than Karloff. King Kong is creeping up on 75 years and the special effects are still ""special"". In the Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) they accomplished the ""effect"" of arrows striking the villains by having the master archer of the day

twang real arrows into stunt men wearing breastplates and the score was written to be in musical tune with the dialogue. AND! it was in color!All the way back in 1938!!! I have luckily played Juror # 3 in several stage productions and know every word of dialogue in all of the versions(stage, tele-play and screenplay) and in my opinion this is a masterpiece. This movie is simply brilliant from every aspect of film as an art. There are no explosions,curse words, car chases or machine guns. But there is unbelievable tension and real violence. Plenty of naked hatred and prejudice. For those of you who have not seen this and are wise enough and maybe old enough to appreciate it please watch and enjoy. For those of you who need hate and violence to get cranked up this movie has all of that without all the phony pretense.

This movie displays an amazing performance by all the actors i.e. the 12 jury members. The whole movie is directed in one set i.e. the jury room. The movie is an exemplary example for how to convince a whole bunch of people who are against your views. Henry Fonda has presented the idea of making others believe in ones opinion very convincingly.

This movie doesn't present a bland way to convince others, but gives an idea of how to read between the lines, how to be attentive at a discussion and how to uncover the loop holes in a particular case.

This epitome of a movie surely deserves to be in the top notch of all the movie ever produced",10
10 August 2010,Search for the best male personality,"""12 Angry Men"" is an awe inspiring movie resembling a play where 12 jury members are asked to determine a young man's fate. The condition that the young man must either be convicted guilty or not guilty is too harsh and made me dislike the plot. However, this movie, at least for me, is not about the decision or the trial but about the 12 unique male characters.

All the 12 men have personalities we can relate to in our daily lives making this movie realistic. For the sake of classification, let's say there are 3 kinds of men - ""so called real men"" , ""Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" and ""cool, fun loving but careless.""

The so called real men are arrogant. They are not at all flexible. They have fixed views and they don't want to change their views. They prefer going with their preconceived notions. They have special ways of behaviour. They represent style - the way they walk n talk. They have personalities which easily make any timid guy to follow them. Such dictatorial people may not make the best leaders but gets most attention for sure. They represent a very high male ego. It is interesting to see Juror no 10 disliked by other jury for his preconceived notions in one scene. His male ego gets hurt when Juror no 4 says ""Now sit down and don't open your mouth again."" His emotional break up is worth watching and so is Juror no. 3's. Difference between juror no. 10 and 3 is juror no 10 does not care for anyone's support when he expresses his views but Juror no. 3 accepts Juror no. 4's leadership. Such kind of men can influence by their personalities but are perceived as vain people.

""Cool, fun loving but careless"" men may be the most appreciated by women but for this plot they are the ones who are least admired. Such self centered people are best for themselves but should have maturity to keep personal life separate from work. Juror no 7 belong to this category. Juror no. 12 also appear to be more n less carefree types.

""Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid"" men are the products of our education system. They are taught to behave with manners, follow social rules and think in certain intellectual ways. They are the pillars for the well being of the society. If they are not there, the system wouldn't even work. They follow discipline. However, they appear weak and boring. Most of the men from the jury belong to this category. However, there are many shades. The timid but intellectual men (Juror no. 1,2,5,6,9,11 )are the ones who are necessary both to keep the best man appear best in relative terms and run the system smoothly. However, when it comes to intellectual, confident men, we have very few options left. Juror no. 8 is the most important character in the plot. However, as movie goes on, he appears manipulative. His guts are appreciable, but taking a stand, which appears neutral at the first instance but using it for self-glory later is not appreciable. Such men can only make winners in the society. However, I personally would not prefer to become such a manipulative winner. (Putting personal prejudices apart: P)

Juror no 4 is an interesting character. He is combination of both characters - real man and intellectual man. He is definitely better than all other personalities but the most important thing is he does not seem to be interested in attracting attention for the sake of attaining it. He is not in the competition. Guess, that makes him the best one however (his apathy towards becoming best) making this search look pathetic.

The whole discussion and the clashes among all these men are worth watching; making this movie a worth watching treat.",9
27 December 2004,Will Always Be a Classic,"To me, this film is probably as close to perfect as any film ever was. The emotion, the story, the acting, etc. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb squaring off. Different jurors harboring different beliefs, goals, views, etc. And even though this film was made close to fifty years ago, it is still as timely as ever. That is why I was so confused that somebody tried to shoot a re-make? Blasphemy! And by the way, that remake really sucked! Of course, after the first couple of times I saw this film, I was confused. I really though the kid did it. I still kind of think he did. Of course, that is the whole point of the film. Maybe he did do it, maybe not. The point of the story is about everybody getting a fair trial and a fair jury. Moreover, I will always remember the courage of Fonda's character, standing up to those eleven others, will very little to cling to. And how the jury ended up having to do what should have been done in the court room all along, try the case. Perhaps the main point of the film was to indict a society and criminal justice system that had lost it's way, if it ever had a way. But the lasting legacy of the film, is the fact that it just might be the greatest movie ever made.",10

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it.

6 April 2007,Simply Astonishing!,"This is such a simple film yet it is one of the best. The reason for this is because this film has touched one of our most sensitive sense - the human emotions. The acting is superb, the writing brilliant, and I cant give enough praise for the camera staff. The story is almost too good to be true yet after seeing this film you're going to believe that it is very possible.

Many actors and filmmakers today should learn that special effects, fancy music, and expensive budget doesn't make a good movie. This movie has none of those junk but it makes up in all the right areas - great acting and excellent writing.

Overall, I'd give it 9.6 out of 10.

8 September 2015,wow,"it should not only be one of the best films it should be the most necessary too. it brought faith in humanity back to me. perceiving me with the image that somewhere in the past might have lived honest people with the power to reasoning.at least actors who are playing this... but they made it somewhat clearer to me. because of that my picture of the humanity has changed into a world where it might be, by the tiniest bit of chance there could be... something worth living for.

and thats what art is made for ""carry the spirit but not reality""

its a bit of a shame that movies nowadays carry mostly nothing but advertisement isn't it?

7 January 2008,Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this movie its every courtroom drama without all the bore that must of them do. I love the actors Henry Fonda is amazing and the rest of the acting is superb. Beautifully filmed in black and white with a epic storyline.You would think that a movie that is filmed 95% of the time in one room would be outstandingly boring. It's not.The characters have really realistic personalities and the dialog fits them to a tee. Obviously an epic to shake the ages for decades to come. Yeah, this movie is excellent in every form of the word and then some. I definitely recommend this to anyone.

3 January 2014,Good story.,"Some decisions are very important for innocent people, thats why being jury very difficult mission. 12 men sitting in the room, story is really very simple but acting is really very high. Jury has to give a difficult decision which is important for someone's life. Selfish people can't see true in first step. You will see how people's decision change. You can watch this movie whenever you want because you never bored and you can't take your eye2 from screen.

I recommend this film because you will learn how to defense yourself and things that you believe. If you ask me you have to watch this classic.

17 February 2012,genius,"Don't think I've ever watched a black and white movie but looking at all the reviews I couldn't stop myself from watching this one.

I gave myself 15 mins to get into this movie and think I only needed 5.

Outstanding film that displays suck a strong message in how people can behave in such a situation.

The jury members who are all white male ranging from difference ages and personalities are obviously what makes the film so exciting.

The film begins with a vote as soon they enter the room and only 1 votes not guilty. This character is what I believe makes this film. The way he produces his facts glues you to the TV to await each other juror's response. Each response is taken differently each time facts are given. Difficult to explain but very interesting and exciting.

The film really does show how people react in everyday situations and in the films case the impact it could have on a young mans life.

Can't put my finger on why I only gave this a 9 - will definitely watch it again to catch all the detail.

19 July 2017,Excellent movie with something to teach,"This is a great movie, with great acting and directing. I really loved how this movie has small breaks every now and then. How, even though the whole movie is essentially is filmed in just one room, without any action, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your chair. And how it tries to teach the viewer to be a critical thinker, and never judge any situation or person by their cover.

6 July 2014,Classic Film,"*Story: Based on the play. 12 men of the jury are deciding if a 18 year old boy is guilty or not guilty for killing his father. 11 men decided that the boy is guilty but one man said he's not guilty. So this single juror tries to prove to the other 11 jurors why the boy is not guilty. The movie then turns into a huge argument between the jurors to put this case to rest.

*Review: 12 Angry Men is one of the best dramas ever made period. And this movie is right up there in my favorite movies of all time. What's really good about this movie is that it all takes place in one room and that's the jury room. The dialogue between the jurors is just phenomenal because you just don't know what the next person is going to say. Also each character is different their not the same which is great. During the film you get to learn about the case and try to piece it all together. This movie is amazing. Everything about this movie is perfect from the acting, writing, and plot. Overall if you love dramas or courtroom dramas then this is your movie.

""Prejudice always obscures the truth."" -Juror #8",10
31 August 2015,One of the rare gems of classic cinema.,"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.

The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.

The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.",9

19 April 2017,Loved it,"The performances in this movie are what take the lead, for sure. I was blown away by the lead actor and all of the co-stars for bringing their A-game in order to deliver a concise and poignant tale of one man's journey to right a bureaucratic oversight.

I was taken aback by all of the actors' abilities to come together to make an ensemble cast that will stand the test of time.

11 June 2012,"This is one of the most enduring, timeless and engaging classics of our time.","This is one of the most enduring, timeless and engaging classics of our time. It has the right to rank among the classics. It has the right to stand tall among all the great pieces of art, Mozart and citizen Kane included. Sidney Lumet is a genius and he surely knows how to tell a story. First you bring about a group of jury members, eleven of whom are sure about a boy's guilt and only a true protagonist goes against all of them. Now the job rest in the hands of the story teller. How will that one juror convince all the others? Henry Fonda was really good. He just had the best expressions to command a team. Then we have all the other actors. Especially Lee J. Cobb, giving the best of his anger. A distraught father who wants to take revenge from his son by pouring his entire hanger on the convicted boy. Everything, just everything makes this movie a piece to love and enjoy.

25 September 2023,A Dozen Grumps,"Ooooooh this is my jam right here. Give me a dialogue driven movie that's just people talking about things in an engaging way and I am here for it! Really great stuff here but the problem with these movies is in reviewing them. The dialogue is aged and doesn't always feel like it still works. The sense of time is way off, it never really feels like this event is taking place for any more than the run time of the movie, but clearly, based on some clues, they're in there longer than that. Yet, despite those things, it's still just riveting to watch. I was hooked to every line of dialogue, every point being made and a touch saddened by how familiar some of this still sounds. Regardless, it was a great time and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone.

9 July 2016,superb movie,"I definitely like this movie as this apart from a good flick it also displays how determination and courage can lead to success against all odds It's not so easy in life to stick to your decision when everyone is against you but if you think you are right then don't deviate from your path and convince other logically to be in your side . Also , it displays the notion that 100 convicts may escape trial but we need to make sure innocent is never ever get convicted. Suspense is maintained throughout the movie and with the series of logical discussions that takes place with great dialogue delivery will not let you get up from your seat anytime during the movie . So overall its must watch movie for all drama lovers !!!

10 August 2018,A masterpiece,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
4 June 2014,A Slow Moving But Creative Comical Movie!,"12 Angry Men was an excellent movie. Why? Because it was slow moving but creative. It had many aspects such as different Points of View of the characters. It was a simple however effective storyline. This is not your typical comedy movie! The acting was superb by many of the characters if not all of them. I highly recommend watching this movie if you want tenseness, surprises, thrills and comedy! The basic plot is a boy who is said to have killed his father. All 11 jurors agree, except one. Can the 12th juror convince all of the other jurors to believe him or will he lose out? Eventually, they turn out all to be 12 Angry Men.....

1 July 2005,Superb Film!,"This has to be one of the greatest films ever made. So simple a script, it wouldn't be difficult to see this happening in real life.

Classic performances by all the actors, especially Henry Fonda.

Whilst black and white this film ranks amongst the highest I have ever seen. I found the storyline to be really moving because you can easily imagine 12 good men and true sending someone down for execution based upon a persons background - ""he comes from that poor downtown area so he must be guilty"".

If ever I have to be prosecuted in a court of law I want to have a Henry Fonda character sat on the jury.

Highly recommended!",10

19 May 2008,Movie making to the finest,"I had never felt a urge to comment on any movie but ""12 Angry Men"" is an exception.Never have I witnessed a movie which contained elaborate details about the psychological aspects of the characters. You have a caring personality,arrogant personality,a short tempered frame of mind,indifference,experienced,unsure,you name it.Throughout the movie you are entertained with clever dialogs and exceptional conceptions.The actors did a wonderful job and you cant find a dull moment in the entire duration of this movie. I wish all good movie fans not to miss out this one because movies like this is a rarity. Surely a THINKING MAN'S THRILLER.

13 August 2023,amazing,"Amazing movie. Especially the fact that this movie is made in one single room (except 3 minutes in total outside). The details that the writer and Sidney Lumet scattered throughout the scenes are extraordinary.

For example, the heat. Staying in the room with 12 men in a hot day, everyone sweating heavily which increases their temper and makes them jittery and wanting to get over with such a serious case. Setting the mood for a very claustrophobic sweaty setting, and I felt it as if I was there with them. After that when the fan worked and the sun went away and it rained, it seemed they were even calmer.

Also, simple details in the dialogue and in the conversations I really enjoyed! Every character has his own sentiment and judgments trying to portray them on the case. All characters have biases, one single person who has a reasonable mindset shifted their whole ideas and prejudices. How regardless of their sentiments and biases they had to fight through them and realize they have to be unbiased and just with the kid. Amazing show of human nature.

I think all the cast did great. Amazing directing by Sidney Lumet. He delivered shots in great angles and dynamics having given only one room. Can't say much about the writing, loved every part of it even though there isn't a court setting showing the case and what happened afterwards.

A masterpiece worth watching.",9
15 June 2021,A Classic among black and white dross,"As a kid I watched hundreds, if not thousands, of black and white movies. The majority were dross, churned out by Hollywood to sate an inexperienced and hungry market. The storylines and acting dire, and that includes some of the renowned ""classics.""

Aged 9 I watched 12 Angry Men. I was engrossed by the power and brutality of the argument(s). Around the same time I saw Godfather 1 & 2, and was also blown away by the intensity of the movies.

Aged 55 I have just watched 12 Angry Men again. A timeless, impeccable movie. In this time of Marvel movies, we need more in the calibre of 12 Angry Men. And a strange thing, the one director who pursues this level of intelligent film making relentlessly is Clint Eastwood, a man of that generation

Superlative movie, superlative, brutal acting. Superlative script. More of this please.",10
10 August 1999,A brilliant film.,"Henry Fonda is excellent in this movie as is the rest of the cast. Its surprising that this movie isn't that boring cause of the fact it takes place basically in the confines of a single room but that's what makes it so great. This movie is a must see for every movie fan.

10 January 2003,One of the best.,"This is certainly moviemaking reduced to its simple and best elements. Nothing elaborate set-wise, or costuming, and no gee-whiz special effects. Just excellent screenplay, directing, and acting.

The cast is very, very special. Their chemistry is all the more remarkable for the diversity of the people and the personalities brought into conflict over the need to reach a verdict in a seemingly simple, open-and-shut case that proves to be a bit more enigmatic and complex than what appears at first glance. Only one of the cast is a bona fide superstar. The rest are character actors, but of exceptional quality, and they all hold their own in comparison to Fonda's performance, which is its usual top-notch quality.

Movie fans will recognize many familiar faces. A youthful-looking Jack Klugman turns in a surprisingly good effort as an up-from-the-streets juror who makes important contributions to the deliberations. Others have noted the strong performance of Lee J. Cobb, whose initially overbearing and confrontational but ultimately quasi-tragic character elicits both disdain and sympathy from the viewer. I also liked E. G. Marshall's character as the last guilty vote holdout along with Cobb's character, but is ultimately convinced to vote not guilty. His conversion is simply and quietly but powerfully expressed, ""I'm convinced. I now have a reasonable doubt..."", and he holds his ground against Cobb's protestations. A nod also goes to Martin Balsam as the patient but often exasperated jury foreman.

Fans of classic movies should definitely consider adding this to their collection. I have the remastered DVD version and it is a visual treat ""in glorious black-and-white"", which fits the scenery and tension of the jury room perfectly.",

28 January 2019,a great classic drama,"A movie which completely blows mordern drama out of the water.

It's captivating from start to finish.

""12 angry men"" is a perfect combination between entertainment, superb acting performances, simple-but-effective cinematography and a touching moral lession.

One thing that keeps it from having a perfect score from me is, due to the nature of the film's dialogue-driven narrative, it doesn't leave room for music scores to shine. Though evidently, it doesn't need music to be a masterpiece.

19 December 2022,Great Concept! 6/10 Effort,"Some major cheesy dialog. The script is held back by drama instead of substance. You really don't get much insight into the case. And more then one of the 12 is annoying more then angry.

There could have been more evidence and debate instead some of the characters changing their vote on a whim , more for dramatic effect then any kind of logic that is believed.

Modern true crime and internet sleuthing can show you what a debate of back and forth speculation on cases could bring to the drama.

But instead we get acting for dramatic sake only.

It's really a 10/10 concept wise, but the twists and turns of convincing someone to change their mind could have been done so much better.

Some big name old time actors give it a try if you like that, but they don't really come across as angry much.

Needed more anger.",6

2 June 2023,"I'm Fonda the film, but the jury is out on whether it should remain a film titan.","Overall, I enjoyed 12 Angry Film. It has solid acting and a fantastic premise - 12 men of different ilk are locked in a sweltering jury room, finding flaws in each others' arguments and personalities in a case where there's more than meets the eye.

However, after comparing to other films, I realised I couldn't rate the film as generously as others. 12 Angry Men is reminiscent of Witness for the Prosecution, a much older play, but one that was coincidentally made into a feature film in the same year. In both productions, the focus is on the forensic examination of a murder case and the majority of the action is limited to a room at court. This allows for the evidence and the larger-than-life characters within the room to capture your undivided attention. So far, so good.

However, out of the two, 12 Angry Men falls short. The film delivers a relatively predictable outcome with fairly one-dimensional characters. Compare this to Agatha Christie's masterpiece, where I was blindsided and amazed by Witness for the Prosecution's plot twist and evolution of character portrayals. 12 Angry Men also lacks the emotional attachment to the defendant that we had in Witness for the Prosecution, as we don't meet him bar a quick shot of his face. The logical deliberations of the jury were engaging, but for a film rated 9 stars, I must admit I was expecting a depth of conversation beyond its peers.

12 Angry Men was clearly good for its time, and remains a good watch, but I'm unconvinced it should remain as venerated as it is.",7

You can almost feel the closeness and heat of that jury room. Outstanding performances all the way around. This picture should have won The Oscar and everybody in it deserves an Oscar especially Lee J. Cobb who steals the movie from Fonda. Jack Warden is also a standout. THere is the scene where Ed Begley is going off on his racist tirade and if you notice(and this a goof)Lee J. Cobb is nowhere to be seen. Where is he? Then he's back. You eagle eyes at IMDb should check it out. I've sent you guys goof before and you have never acknowledged them. They are there but you guys won't send me an e-mail confirm or deining it.

13 July 2007,I am one of the 12 angry men - UNMISSABLE CLASSIC,"Henry Fonda is my personal favourite of the classic cinema era in the 1940's (The Lady Eve, The Grapes of Wrath etc.). Sidney Lumet grabbed the point of film-making in this movie, made a genuine, unprecedented and essential classic masterpiece. What is virtuosity, if not shooting a meaningful discussion in the 90% of a movie in a room?! There is no strong acting or outstanding camera work, but everyone shares equally in setting up this incomparable courtroom drama. What an editing, what a great simple base story!

The release year of the film is 1957 and I think it is a perfect timing because from my viewpoint it refers to communism, and people's disbelief in it. I mean by that that not everything is what is looks like, and it is easy to agree with the majority on obvious evidences. We have to get to behind reason, to search for the reason of the reason, and to always think before we leap. Stubbornness is not the answer for a complex issue.

I would not spoil any film lovers upcoming experience by writing a word about the plot. Enjoy it!",10
20 November 2015,An ethical battle of minds brought to your screen,"This movie is excellent. 12 angry men is a spellbinding step into the juridical world of ethical choice making that many have to go through their life. This movie hits hard on many levels, the directing is masterful, making each viewer feel personally invested into the murder, the ethical choice of choosing on the fate of someones life and hoping that the people you are watching will do the right choice and deciding if they actually do the right choice or if they have all been duped by doubt. This movie is minimalist staying principally in one room, with 12 characters deciding the fate of a human being. The film traverses many genres: from the courtroom drama, to the detective drama, to the ethical character(s)portrait rendered by conversation and relation that each character has with one another and excels at each giving the audience a refined viewing experience, with little to no flaw.

30 April 2004,"No bombs, no karate, no love story, no major scene changes, no color......GREAT MOVIE!!!!","Can you believe that there is a successful movie that has none of the major Hollywood tried and true methods to create a lasting memory? This film is a major triumph that still creates a stir in me every time I see it. It's power is not in the visual images created, (although much of the cinematography is imaginative, especially the last shot from the coat closet, even with the challenge of one major room), but in the drama created by the tension of men coming together from all walks of lives to judge another human being. They bring their prejudices, their fear, their life experiences, their lack of interest, and their anonymity into a room to make a decision--that's when the real story starts.

We all think about the possibility of having to face that day--some relish the opportunity while others fear making a bad decision. It's one reason this film resonates with so many people. It's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people. The remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues. Both lack one thing--a female's point of view! But that creates even more tension. After all, men don't want to deal with their emotions the same way women do. Besides, we would have to change the title! :o)",10
10 December 2016,A Must Watch Movıe,"I am recommending this movie to be watched in my business life. You can see all kind of demonstrations of different type of characters and behaviors affecting decision taking and process.You can see how people are changing their minds and and getting influenced by others. Another important part of the movie is you can see how the people can react to the same topic by coming from different culture, education, priorities and mindset can influence or being influenced by others. There are so many techniques have been used to demonstrate all these and the outcomes of these are also showing ın a very simple way. I definitely recommend you to watch this extraordinary movie you will enjoy it.

4 March 2005,"You want to see this boy die because you personally want it, not because of the facts!","This is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most important for everyone to watch. Sidney Lument directs this film with great treatment. Hardly any musical score, and about 95% of the action taking place in one room is very hard to do, but he pulls it off. And I have to say, this is probably one of the greatest ensemble casts ever put on film. All 12 jurors are excellent. Henry Fonda delivers his performance in the every man feel he always performs. Lee J. Cobb delivers his best performance in his career. E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, and Robert Webber are just a few of the other names that lead the cast with their roles. Why were none of these actors up for any Oscars for this film? It's still a mystery to me. I believe all actors of today, especially all the new actors from the past ten years, should watch this film, and see how the old pros did it. They just don't make 'em like they used to.

2 January 2019,Simple but great,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects, but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

4 February 2017,"Brilliant writing, directing, acting, and filming!","This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.

Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.

Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget.",10

25 January 1999,A brilliant and humane film.,"I am writing to express disagreement with the previous commentator who suggested that the film casts doubt on the jury system. The jury system is democratic, in that it allows the defendant to put their case before twelve ordinary members of the public and not an arbitrary, draconian body.

Henry Fonda's character demonstrates that through the use of reason and not reaction, a jury can uphold humane values. All of the indifference, contempt and inflexibility is swept away by the patient and thoughtful reasoning of Fonda. The film is cinematically superb and has a timeless and beautiful human message that we must never lose sight of.

6 February 2017,Great Classic A Must See,"12 Angry Men is a great movie I am a big fan of classics genre I can confidently say that this by far the most unique film I have ever seen. Although people of my generation we tend to watch modern films but I have a special place in my heart for classics as well, It was when I surfed around the Internet looking for something good to watch. Then I stumble upon this title '12 Angry Men' I didn't think of it as much so I thought I will just give it a try. As it started I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention first but as the movie progressed I kind of got engaged to the whole argument the men were having from that point I got sucked in to the film. I like the way it is viewed as a first person while making the experience more interactive. I fear I might as well never see a film as spotless as this one as we modern viewers like to point out mistakes, goofs or spoofs but this movie is pretty close to perfection totally recommend to anyone who likes to see cinema from a whole new perspective.

2 October 2019,Truly astounding,"A brilliant narrative. I have not read the book, but the author manages to depict the process of a movement as if you yourself were arguing with these men. You can understand the complexities of their character without even knowing their name, something you're not even aware of until the end. The director manipulates your emotions simply with cinematic mastery as if he has you on the end of puppet strings. It is remarkable how well this story is told. If you happens to read this far (which I realize is unlikely) there is no way I could put all of the complexities of this movie into words, partly because it is and incredibly complex tapestry, yet a remarkably simple story, and partly because I just lack the effort. I can not praise this movie enough. It was perfectly executed.

5 April 2013,Many talented actors,"12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Ed Begley give good performances and make their characters believable. Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda.

3 October 2007,They don't make them like this anymore.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10

18 March 2017,Ahead of its time,"A black-and-white film released in 1957, 12 Angry Men was nevertheless one that can captivate its modern audience despite the fact that the entirety of the film was practically shot in a Jury room and consisted of just dialogues. Yet, it may be precisely on this ground that it was able to illustrate clearly to the audience the importance of overcoming our implicit prejudices to arrive at a successful negotiation. Without dictating any Jurors to take up an extreme 'bad guy' role (these are characters and personalities that we often see in our everyday lives), the film further attempts to draw parallels from the Jury room to the real world through urging us to reflect on our prejudices as we go through the hum-drums of our everyday lives.

28 February 2020,A must watch classic.,"If you wanted proof that Dialogue and brilliant acting coveys more than beautiful visuals than watch this movie because that's all there is to it. 12 Angry Men is one of those classic movies that you absolutely must watch even if you're not too fond of old black and white films. It's an extremely interesting watch from start to finish. The whole movie is set in one single room and is about a 12 man jury on a murder trial. Henry Fonda who plays the main Protagonist has to convince everyone in the room that the Defendant is in fact innocent. What you can expect after that is just a mix of emotions and brilliant drama done through masterful acting and genius writing. If you haven't watched it already and need a reason to, just do it. There's no reason not to unless everything mentioned in this review is just not your thing.

24 March 2017,"Communication, Understanding and Respect as Key","12 men debating over the fate of a boy who was suspected of killing his father. 12 different personalities and an array of interests, the debates portrayed the importance of listening, understanding, respect and empathy.

It is vital we disentangle perceptions and emotions from the problem. As perceptions are shaped by varied experiences and values, an array of perceptions is undeniable in any negotiation. However, allowing perceptions to determine our views on the problem at hand is detrimental as it not only leads to an obscuration of truth, but also an inaccurate basis upon which we make a decision. For example, Juror 10, with his preconceived prejudices against slum-dwellers as a result of his experience living among them, voted ""Guilty"". This prejudice undeniably resulted in a biased view, ignoring the fact that experiences are varied and more crucially, doing no justice to the boy. This is further compounded when his prejudice was taken as a personal attack by Juror 5 who lived in a slum before, engendering a flurry of emotions. In this regard, it is evident that perceptions and emotions are intricately entwined and it is crucial that we attack the problem, not the people (Fisher and Ury, 2012).

In light of varied perceptions, it is important that interests of individuals are made explicit. This is so as when we begin to ask ""WHY?"", inaccurate perceptions and selfish interests could be teased out, allowing us to see how each side has multiple interests. For example, within the ""Guilty"" side, a range of interests was noticed – where Juror 7's interest lied in wanting to ""get out of here"", while Juror 3's problematic interest stemmed from his strained relationship with his son. Insodoing, we would be able to correct inaccurate and biased perceptions, while respecting and understanding the basic concerns of others.

At the core of it, clear communication and active listening of interests, alongside values of respect and empathy, are crucial in ensuring efficiency and an improvement or maintenance of relationships.",9
26 December 2019,good movie,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

23 December 2020,12 Angry Men~ Fantabulous,"12 Angry Men is a movie brilliantly directed by Sidney Lumet, even for 2020, it still has a tremendously intriguing storyline, too-which I was quite stunned by.

It's not a typical action, run, and chase kind of film, Instead the director, Sidney Lumet focuses on a dramatically intense conversation between 12 characters, set in one ordinary room. The Writer, Reginald Rose conjures such dialogues that are extremely interesting to follow-through thus, the audience would not have a robust urge to look away, and indulge with their phones. The movie may be ""12 Angry Men"", however as an audience I truly felt as if I were one of them or the 13th member present in the room along with them, trying to debate whether or not the convict; convicted is innocent or absolute guilty. I loved how I was legit switching sides as the diced rolled, and a few logical ideas came up, because it does force you too question the secenrio.

I Don't think the movie could have ended in a better way, that it did, because, from the inside you vigriously beleive something could be the truth, however on the other side of the specturm, there are couple of theory that counterdict your existing thoughts.",10
24 July 2006,Comment on '12 Angry Men',"As an exciting analysis of character this film could hardly be bettered. From the bored judge through the scared teenager to the twelve jurors, there is no chink of characterisation which is missing. We know nothing which is normally known, someone's name, their occupation, what their interests are, and so on. But each person in the room is required to open himself up to the gaze of the other eleven; we have prejudice, contempt, alienation, cooperation, cogent analysis of circumstance, violent emotion, vacillation and even humour despite the looming death penalty. This is the king of character analysis films and the screenwriter Reginald Rose is a genius.

29 September 2006,Best scripts ever written!,"Movie to be remembered for long time! The concept of viewing movie has been changed. It's not only entertaining but thrilling as it goes towards the end. One of the best script ever written for wide range of excellent actors.

There are lots of things happening in one locked room. A fantastic drama, which can be a reality.

My best friend was watching with me and he was not at all happy seeing monochrome picture. He went watchful as it got started and towards the end he was sitting at edge of his seat. We even re-winded some of the scenes and dialog.

22 October 2020,A great movie is timeless,"I did not know about this film till I was given the task of watching it for my school assignment. Upon hearing that this film is quite dated and in black and white, I prepared myself for a dull and boring film. Needless to say, by the end of it, I had never been so wrong. This film is a masterpiece in storytelling. The premise of the film is simple, 12 men in a room debating on the guilt/innocence of one man, yet manages to grip the viewer through great acting and writing.

The tension between the jurors in how they attempt to convince one another of their viewpoints allows us to gain some insight on how we should negotiate or deal with others. Some insights such as 1) Removing personal emotions/ prejudice from the objective or problem at hand 2) Ensuring that all parties meet at a time and place that is suitable and conducive (not when someone has a ball game to run off to, or the hottest day of the year.) 3) Speaking to be understood and not just heard. Communicating effectively with one another so as to prevent misunderstandings.

Overall this movie is brilliant and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family!",10
22 October 2020,Proof that good writing and actors is all you need for an excellent movie,"I was first introduced to 12 Angry Men as a movie assignment from school. Seeing that it was quite a dated film in black & white, I had the impression it would be dull and boring. After watching the movie, I am glad that I had never been so wrong.

12 Angry Men manages to keep the audience hook throughout the film without the need for explosion, guns, sex or violence. A superb cast with excellent writing were the main ingredient to produce this masterpiece.

The constant tension between the jurors and how they present their arguments trying to convince one another whether the defendant is guilty or not allows the viewer to learn some points in negotiation. 1) Separate emotion and prejudice from the decision making. 2) Hold discussions or meetings at a time and place where everyone is able to fully commit to (Instead of rushing off to watch the ball game, or sweating in the hottest day of the year). 3) Speak to be understood, and not just heard. Effective communication is essential as well.

Overall I deeply enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to others to watch as well!",10

1 March 2006,"One angry woman vs. ""12 Angry Men""?","12 Angry Men (1957)****

In 1957. following five films were in the competition for the Best Picture Academy Award: David Lean's ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", Joshua Lagan's ""Sayonara"", Mark Robson's ""Peyton Place"", Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" and Billy Wilder's ""Witness for the Prosecution"". Pretty impressive list. Not surprisingly, Oscar went to Bridge

The last two (12 Angry Men and Witness for the Prosecution) were both exciting and intense courtroom dramas. 12 Angry Men, written by Reginald Rose, was about 12 jurors with not an easy task  to decide whether a young man is guilty or innocent on the charge of murder. Their decision must be unanimous. Witness for the Prosecution was a complex, unpredictable and full-of-surprises mystery from the novel written by famous Agatha Christie. Both excellent movies.

Somewhere I read that Agatha Christie once said something like:12 Angry Men is an awfully stupid movie because it is not operating with the facts but only with the jurors' presumptions. I don't know whether she really said that (she'll excuse me if not) but this is rather pseudo-argument.

Although it is true that the jurors are operating rather with ""ideas"" than ""facts"" in this film this is certainly not a flaw or weakness.

Almost everything seems clear after the trial and jurors vote 11:1 for ""guilty"". Only, juror #8 (Henry Fonda) votes ""innocent"" not because he think he is but because he think that the boy deserves some discussion. Slowly, toward the end, one by one, all judges change their votes as a result of a long, intense discussions and quarrels.

These discussions are the battle of nerves, personal observations, prejudices, moralities  in a word  characters. Because there is a little fact, jurors are forced to project their own perspectives. This is very significant, since it is happening in all courts and among all judges.

While all the judges, one by one, reveal their thoughts, there is absolutely brilliant, detailed and consistent character development in this film. Also, since the judges are from the various backgrounds there's a superb representation of American society. In addition with the great directorial effort from Lumet (in his debut!), who made great atmosphere using special lenses, long cadres and extracting the maximum from the actors, we have a truly unforgettable film.

Agatha Christie maybe created the great plot (also clever dialog) in Witness for the Prosecution, but ""12 Angry Men"" is digging much deeper.",10
26 May 2020,The epitomy of filmmaking,"A movie with 12 men, one room, one case, one boy, one murder and one life at stake. The movie is the definition of creating something huge with so little. The character developement is a study case on its own and the moral lessons of standing up against the mass, the jury's and citizen's responsibility, the tackling of rasicm, the principle of reasonable doubt, innocence until proven guilt and burden of proof are uniquely captured and conveyed in the form of a dialogue, when 12 men seek the truth so as to come to a verdict. The self evident value of human life as the ultimate value in our society is always interwoven with the unfolding of the story throughout the movie while a stellar cast and a startling director turns this movie into a mesmerizing masterpiece.

15 March 2006,A true Classic........Enjoy every moment of this brilliant masterpiece.,"12 Angry Men"" is a fascinating but uncomfortably close examination of the workings of constitutional law and the fact that a person's life can be in the hands of 12 people who are themselves full of faults, failings and doubts. The film makes it graphically clear that the people who enforce law are all too human and that there are calm, decent people like Juror #8 (Fonda) who are willing to weigh the evidence and look for innocence rather than rush toward the verdict of guilt..........This is undoubtedly one of the top 3 movies i have seen and i give it a Ten on Ten......... A true Classic........Enjoy every moment of this brilliant masterpiece.

23 January 2003,Excellent!,"My 10th-grade class just watched ""12 Angry Men"" this week in civics class since we've been studying about the US judicial branch, and our teacher wanted to show us how prejudice can effect a verdict. But anyway, as for the movie itself, I really enjoyed it. It's about a jury trying to decide the verdict of a murder case where a teenage boy stabbed his father with a knife. At first the jurors all have a ""let's get this over with and go home"" attitude and the vote is 11 to 1 guilty, but the one juror who questions the kid's guilt presents his arguments and suddenly all 12 jurors are arguing and debating over the evidence. The whole movie, except for the first and last scenes, takes place in the jury room, in a claustrophobic Hitchcock-esque manner which leaves the drama of the movie entirely up to the talent of the actors. The actors are all excellent and bring the dialogue to life as the jurors' personalities clash and they review the evidence over and over to ensure justice. When I think of ""classic Hollywood movies"", it's movies like this that come to mind. I reccomend ""12 Angry Men"" as entertainment and also as a reminder to us all to take our duties as American citizens seriously.

13 January 2022,12 Angry man is the revolution behind dialog-based movies,"This movie has more tension than most of the action movies despite the fact that this dialog-based movie is so calm, in a vociferous way!!

I have watched it 3 times and still it is uniquely and drastically the best concerning how simple and professional the camera angles were, relatively with the atmosphere as well as the mostly perfect dialog

A masterpiece.

31 May 2021,An extraordinary (almost) one-room drama,"'12 Angry Men' is a classic 1950s film, presented as a piece of theatre. There are marvelous performances from all the actors, and the dramatic tension builds throughout. Everyone should have this film on their 'bucket list'.

21 October 2012,Best Film I've ever seen,"This is the best film I've ever seen. Adding a bit of personal touch, I can say this is the only film I've seen more than 3 times (5 times). I even created this account on IMDb just to review this film.

Being accustomed to color films, initially I thought that this film would be quite dull and boring. But I still decided to give try, considering the high rating given to it in most of the movie rating sites.

Initially, at least for the first 10 minutes, it was boring. The jurors were chatting among themselves, going to washrooms, cursing the heat... But as the actual arguments began, it became interesting; I mean really interesting. Of course, it was obvious what the final verdict would be: the boy was to be acquitted. But the way the arguments were presented was fabulous. It never appeared like a film. Instead, it appeared to be a real debate- with jurors showing emotions, ego and prejudice- just like in real life. The acting was fantastic with almost all actors performing extremely well( 8 of twelve were very good. Rest four were good enough, though slight improvements were possible. I forgot their numbers so I'm cant point 'em out)

There isn't much of a plot to this film. Almost whole of this film is made up of dialogues. In fact the plot is so small that it can be written in less than 50 words( movie is about 100mins long).The entire filming(90%) takes place in just one room (including attached bathroom).

Basically, its the arguments that makes this film an all time masterpiece. Traditions may change, style may change, but logic and rationality doesn't.

In my opinion this movie is a ""must watch"".

P.S.: DON'T WATCH THE REMAKE AT ANY COST. It is terrible. I mean really hopeless. Yes, it is in colour, but the acting is so bad that I couldn't watch it for even 10 minutes. It appears like a sham. The dialogues are almost the same as the original film but lacks the charm. I would prefer watching the old movie again over watching the remake. The jurors appear to be anxiously waiting for their turn to speak out the dialogues they have memorised. The main character appears weak and fragile. The other jurors appear like students acting in school plays: only thinking of when their turn comes, stiff, lacking spontaneity.",10
5 August 2012,What else can be said about it...,"Every movie fan in the world needs to see this movie at least once in their lives.

Where to start? The superb acting performances by all the jurors is awe-inspiring. What's more, all 12 of them seem to really click and feed off each other. Though credit must also be given to the fantastic directing.

You feel the scenes of the movie really mesh into one smooth ride... it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as the movie progresses. You won't for a second feel like you are watching a movie made in 1957 due to the timelessness of human nature and our societal issues. This is one of the main reasons this movie ages so well...

Finally, and this has been mentioned before, the fact it is in black and white strangely makes it that much more real. It emphasizes the beauty of this movie: its story, dialogue, acting, and directing. Not the crazy production we have nowadays. Nope.. this is a movie about the basics of film making, and how to execute them perfectly. 10/10",10
3 October 2021,Movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it.

9 January 2010,Simply superb,"Thanks to IMDb Top 100 list , I decided to watch this movie and never regretted the decision .

One of the great movies in my all time list , 12 Angry Men is truly a classic, if you haven't watched it yet , my only question to you is what are you waiting for ? Please go for it , and I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed; Its Henry Fonda's flawless performance that stands out , as does the other jurors'. Watch it for the awesome screenplay , how the jury plays out and discusses and argues over the decision - I believe this has been based from a play , but the movie is splendid to say the least.

6 December 2018,Cliché: A Masterpiece,"What can you make of a movie that takes place during the course of one day, and located in the same room? Two options: a bore or a masterpiece. This movie easily follows the second option with its very well-written and structured script, its talented actors and its on point mise-en-scène. Long story short, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, a classic must see.

19 January 2022,Mixed feelings when viewing,"The painting ""12 angry men"" with its demonstrative focus on a particular case, with its advertised isolation within four walls, at this point in the development of its driving thought breaks its own isolation. Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Reginald Rose are included in the circle of the great problems of contemporary foreign art, in its very center.

The heroes of the film are, in fact, little people. But the classic motif is reinterpreted. XX learned too well the danger of historical philistinism, the adaptability of a small person to an all-powerful ""situation"", and finally, the danger of inaction as one of the forms of adaptability.

10 October 2002,Masterpiece,"If ever there was a film to inspire a youngster to take up law, this is it. I know, it did me.

The plot and scenery could hardly be any simpler, yet the tension and social commentary could hardly be any greater. This film should be a must for any film studies curriculum. It shows what can be done with skillful acting and direction without resort to the gratuitous cinematography so popular with modern day film makers.

28 August 2023,Still relevant today,"I won't say the movie doesn't feel dated but it really doesn't matter. It's black and white, the way people speak and the acting is dated. But the story is not.

Basically it's about the justice system and how a jury has to figure out if what they just heard is the truth and if they should sentence someone to jail.

This is a character movie and what was pretty cool is you don't ever see some of the characters, they just talk about them. That is what this movie is, a bunch of people talking through a problem they face.

It makes you think if you were on a jury would you be able to be unbiased or would you act like some of the characters in this movie.

24 November 2003,Masterful piece of minimalist cinema,"Ever wonder why anyone would want to sit through a long, dialogue-heavy B&W film shot almost entirely in a single, boring room when there are thousands of other movies with all the whistles and bells of modern culture?

This movie is the reason. 12 Angry Men is probably one of the best stage plays adapted to film, with the juror seats filled by some of the greatest actors of the 50s. Each character avoids becoming a stereotypical cliche, and all the performances are memorable, most notably Lee J. Cobb and, of course, Henry Fonda. Interestingly shot, intensely acted, and an indelible morality play.

25 March 2004,"Classic, superb, timeless","What can I say about a film that, deservedly, has such a high place on IMDb's list of the top 250 of all time?

This film says so much about human nature, and the ways in which we come to form opinions, and in some cases, are bullied out of doing what is right. Although this film was released before I was (so to speak), it holds up beautifully 47 years later, and I hope that audiences can still relate to it 147 years after the release...

Let me qualify that: I hope that, as a society, that the average Joe/Jane is not as prejudiced or judgmental as many of the jurors in this film. Yet, I hope that audiences can always watch this movie and admire the simple courage of Fonda's character (as well as Sweeney's and Klugman's) and the wonderful acting of Lee J Cobb, among others.

Simple, brilliant film-making and acting! Should not be missed!",10

19 February 2015,Another vote.,"It's a quiet afternoon here in Nicosia so i decided to sip on my coffee and watch the old time classic 12 Angry Men, I won't go into deep details because i'm still amazed by the performances in the movie. A movie with a minimum budget and filming on the same location it's an exceptional thing to do in the 50's where the film critics and movie people where expecting the 'getaway' film look where they could express themselves and not just watching some guys talking in the same room. But guess what? This is a movie about 12 guys just talking in the same room for 1 and a half hours and that's what makes this movie a complete masterpiece, A jury of 12 man deciding on the fate of an 18 year old boy whether he is innocent or guilty. It's a must watch, this movie will be remembered for some a good amount of centuries to go. Recommended for all audiences. I will write a full review of the movie soon as well as i rewatch it.

7 November 2020,"There are at least 12 reasons why this ""movie"" sucks.....","""12 Angry Men"" (1957), I have heard people go nuts over this ""film"", time and time again. The hype was insane between everyone I've heard who mentioned anything about it or anything related to it. So, I finally gave in and put it on. What a major disappointment! It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top 10 most boring films I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of dull and boring movies, but this ""film"" excels at both of those aspects. This ""movie"" has a boring story, standard to horrible acting and a generic dull soundtrack. As far as the story goes, it's one of the most uninteresting, boring, unnecessary and unbearable I've ever seen. It's only 96 minutes, but it felt like I was watching it for days! The storyline is, 12 jurors argue on whether a person is guilty or not guilty. Seriously, that's the whole movie, just 12 boring characters sitting in a boring room talking. How riveting! Right? You might as well hide a couple of video cameras in a jury room and press record, same thing! Now, I have seen movies before that take place in a single setting from beginning to end. Some were good, some were bad. ""12 Angry Men"" is probably one of the worst examples of how not to make a film taking place in the same location. It was so dull, that I could barely fight to keep my eyes open! Another big issue is lack of character development. The main characters are cast as: Juror 1, Juror 2, etc. Yes, we do find out their names at the end when they introduce themselves. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules when making a movie or TV show, character development. This ""movie"" has virtually none of that. The only positive about this ""film"" is that it somehow inspired a lot of tributes and parodies on TV shows. Those were so much more entertaining than this pile of filth! Before you guys tell me, ""it's realistic, this movie is supposed to be as close to a real-life scenario as possible."" I'm all for movies with realism. When done right, it can be very effective! ""12 Angry Men"" is a little bit too real. Wow, I never thought I'd hear myself say that! Overall, the plot of this ""movie"" is so bad, that describing my feelings toward it as angry is an understatement. That's one of the two worst things a film can do; anger me, or bore me. ""12 Angry Men"" does both! As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad, unfortunately. From the whole entire cast! The only ones who actually seem to be trying are Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Jack Warden. All of the rest of the performances were either bad or just plain boring. It's a real pity, because all of these actors are great in other movies and TV shows. What happened here? Finally, the soundtrack in this ""movie"" is overall very generic and not memorable in the least. There are a couple of parts of the film score that aren't too bad. The opening theme during the opening credits and the ending theme. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it's just a failing pile of trash. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this ""film"". Yes, surprisingly, this ""movie"" has some good things in it. All of the sets/locations and the special effects are good. The only thing that almost cost the sets/locations star is that it is in black and white. That just accentuates the boredom of the environment. But, it suits the story, or lack thereof, in this ""movie"". So, I still give it a pass at the end of the day. Finally, the special effects are good and still hold up to this day. My only nitpick is that all of the words in the opening and closing credits are all lower case. Did a kid write the titles and credits? Or, did someone forget to capitalize? ""12 Angry Men"" has found a place on my most disappointing films list and most boring films list. It's a real shame, because I really tried so hard to like it. But, it did next to nothing for me. I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""12 Angry Men"", it sucks, plain and simple. The sad thing is, that there are schmucks out there who like it, and some even consider it to be their favorite movie! Why? What are you all drinking? God forbid any of you watch an exciting movie, you may have a heart attack! ""12 Angry Men"" in my verdict is guilty of all charges. All it does is remind me of how much I hate jury duty!",4
2 August 2023,12 Angry Men (1957) - A Riveting Cinematic Masterpiece,"""12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its compelling narrative and powerful performances. Set almost entirely within the confines of a jury room, the film delves into the intricacies of human psychology, prejudice, and the pursuit of justice.

The story unfolds as twelve diverse jurors deliberate the fate of a young man accused of murder. Initially, the case seems like an open-and-shut one, but as the jury begins its deliberation, tension rises, and hidden biases come to the fore. Henry Fonda delivers an exceptional portrayal of Juror #8, a rational and compassionate man who questions the overwhelming guilty verdict and seeks to expose the truth beyond reasonable doubt. The cast, comprising veteran actors, flawlessly portrays their respective characters, with each juror leaving an indelible mark on the unfolding drama.

One of the film's most significant achievements lies in its powerful exploration of human nature and the frailties of judgment. As the deliberation progresses, we witness the transformation of these twelve individuals, each bringing their unique backgrounds and prejudices to the table. The screenplay, written by Reginald Rose, is a masterclass in storytelling, as it gradually builds tension, revealing new layers of complexity within the jurors' personalities.

The film's minimalist setting, primarily confined to the jury room, adds an air of claustrophobia, emphasizing the intensity of the emotional battle being fought within those walls. Lumet's direction skillfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, prompting self-reflection on the nature of justice, empathy, and the dangers of snap judgments.

""12 Angry Men"" stands as an eloquent testament to the power of dialogue and the strength of human spirit in the face of prejudices and preconceived notions. Its themes of justice, empathy, and the importance of upholding the integrity of the legal system remain as relevant today as they were when the film was released.

In conclusion, ""12 Angry Men"" is a must-watch cinematic gem that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It continues to be a shining example of how exceptional storytelling, compelling performances, and insightful direction can elevate a film into an enduring classic.",9
18 December 2008,An Excellen Film that Uses Little to Say Much,"With 12 Angry Men, director Sidney Lumet makes so much out of so little. All of the men are wearing white shirts and ties, and when we first see them they all appear to be as simple as their clothes; they make small talk before casting the first vote, and we make the mistake of feeling like we understand them. But as Henry challenges their decisions, we learn that they each have a complex set of beliefs and motivations.

We soon learn that evidence is not the only thing that's influencing many of the juror's decisions. Some vote guilty because they don't trust teenagers, some do it because they don't trust the young man's ethnicity, which is never made clear (but racial stereotyping certainly is), some do it because it just ""feels"" right, and some do it to escape the boredom or oppressive heat. These factors, together with the evidence, make it seem obvious that the man truly did murder his father, but Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) refuses to let him die without being absolutely certain that he is in fact guilty.

Fonda's character reminds the men of two very important things that they either forgot or didn't take into consideration. The first is that a young man's life is in their hands, and whatever conclusion they come to is going to profoundly affect him. Although this is never discussed, it's possible that none of the jurors have ever had to make such an important decision and are not used to taking the kind of precaution such a situation requires (in fact, Juror No. 12 appears to treat it like a routine board meeting). Fonda is fully cognizant of the severity and tries to get the others to feel the same way. He also reminds them that a guilt verdict must be made free of any doubt. According to American law, a man is innocent until proved guilty, but the men consider it to be the other way around. It is through close examination of the evidence that the men are able to reach a verdict clear of any doubt or outside influences.

Of course, the road from small talk to their final verdict is not a smooth one, and never has there been so much drama in one single room. Although Lumet keeps them in the same room, which has no interesting features, for the great majority of the film, he manages to pull of some subtle yet incredible cinematic effects. In the beginning, the camera is placed towards the ceiling and we are looking down at the jurors, a visual metaphor for our mistaken feeling that they are simple men. Later, it is placed toward the floor and we now look up at them and perhaps even marvel at their complexity. Lumet has challenged our conception of the average man, showing us through camera and dialogue that he or she can indeed be very intricate.

Lumet also uses different lenses to great effect. As the film progresses, he uses lenses with longer focal lengths to make the room seem smaller. The tension is greatly increased as the walls seem to close in on the men, and this can be seen as different metaphor: as Juror 8 dismisses the stereotypes and prejudices, the only thing left is the evidence.

12 Angry Men is a masterpiece and can be the subject of endless analysis. It can be viewed from a political and a sociological perspective, and would be great for a prospective cinematographer to study. If nothing else, the acting and dialogue are superb and make for an entertaining experience.",10

12 November 2014,Absolute must watch,"I first watched this movie with my parents many moons ago. I was young and I think this was the first black and white movie I'd watched the whole way through. Fast forward until today and I can still sit and watch it through with no problem. I find no fault in the portrayal of the characters with the actors, in fact they draw me into their scenario. Each time I watch I notice things I did not before. If you are looking for a quiet evening movie or a Sunday afternoon movie, I would not look much further than this.

I love the setting, and I found it completely fascinating to sit through. When watching I am hooked. And by the end, I feel satisfied that I didn't waste my time sitting through it. I can't even compare it to another like it, as it's so unique in my eyes.

If I were to find one flaw, I actually find I can't. I don't get commission and it's rare I can find nothing wrong with a movie but with such a strong storyline with each character having their own important roles within such a small space and playing it so beautiful, I honestly can't on this occasion.

21 August 2005,Closed room with 12 men and heated discussion,"12 angry men was a unique movie I ever saw, it was such a simple plot and extremely low cost movie marvelously done. I was told that this movie is showed in most top business schools to teach MBA students the leadership skills and the power of discussion. Lot of people would think how boring a movie would be if the whole movie is all about the jury discussion but it isn't. It keeps you engaged and you never even get chance to think that you are bored. An Indian movie ""Ek Ruka Hua Faisala"" was also made on the same plot and inspiration. That was also a very popular movie. Henry Fonda's role is so impressive and he did it right. I would so watch it even if you don't like the kind of movies where you have to put yourself while you are watching them, watch this one. This one is very very good.

25 May 2018,How can this be SO good?,"Simply the best courtroom drama ever made. The tension, twists and the overall pacing are great and make the movie so entertaining and thought provoking. And it's technically 12 guys in one room arguing... it's freaking brilliant!

15 March 2014,An amazing movie with a great plot,"This movie is my favorite classic movie that has great plot that really makes you think. Taking place in a courthouse for the entire movie, 12 jury men discuss whether or not a man is guilty of murder. 11 of the men think he is guilty, mainly because they just want to go home. But one man thinks he may be innocent. They discuss the murder throughout the entirety of the movie. I believe classic movies are generally looked down upon by my generation (teens) just because it is old, this angers me that people are that ignorant, this movie is truly impressive and timeless. It is very engaging that kept me glued to the screen. The dialogue is really good.

20 October 2018,MASTERPIECE,"The acting. There is nothing else to say. Ever since I saw it the first time around 15 years ago I've been loving this movie. Out of over 1100 movies I have rated on this site, only 5 movies have got 10/10. This is one of them. Just let me say this again: The acting out of these 12 gentlemen is beyond anything you will ever see.

18 May 1999,One of the Greatest Films Ever Made.,"A film of this caliber could NEVER be made today. Gasp, not a single car chase through the streets, no automatic weapons barrages, no plate glass windows being shattered and, of course, that staple of today's entertainment, the obligatory explosion. Lord, imagine a movie without an explosion. Why the thought is positively Bolshevik!

Is it ancient history, or wasn't there a time when films with great acting and compelling plots were produced that were not ""independent"" films? On second thought, maybe I'm confused, perhaps that was back in Periclean Athens. Can't wait for Lethal Weapon 5. I hope it won't be as highbrow as LW4.

But seriously, folks, 12 Angry Men (and it would appear that I'm #13) belongs in every film-lover's permanent video library as a reminder of what heights film making can achieve.

22 January 2010,"""You don't need a million $ for a masterpiece, you just need the wits"" - 12 Angry Men delivers!","This movie is a classic proof of brilliant acting and witty storyline surpassing all the flashy frills of modern cinema. Even the James Bonds before 007 (ie. North by Northwest) used to spread around cash everywhere to make eye-candy thrillers, but behold! 12 Angry Men will prove otherwise.

If you want a witty movie, feel smart (by being a person to have watched a Black n White film and brag about it the next day) AND enjoy AMAZING entertainment at the same time - then this is a MUST WATCH!

Thus, its not only ""highly recommended"" but a ""MUST SEE.""

11 October 2002,Simply amazing,"I watched this movie with very high expectations, and it lived up to every expectation. I had already seen the TV version starring Jack Lemmon as Juror # 8 which I enjoyed. This movie was much better. The acting spectacular. Every character turns in a top notch performance, and Lee J. Cobb is spectacular. Very similar to the TV adaptation, but different in the execution of the picture. I was highly impressed.

16 July 2016,Powerful Simplicity,"This movie is great. It displays the prejudice, conceit, narrow-mindedness, arrogance, impatience and vicious stubbornness of human modern condition, even in this so-called enlightened country.

While Henry Fonda's character might give us hope for rationality and cool- headed deliberation in times of stress and in the interest of justice, that his is an overwhelmingly lone voice in a crowded room, is truly disturbing.

Sometimes it feels as if the movie is shot in real time. the jurors are all defined in terms of their personalities, backgrounds, occupations, prejudices and emotional tilts.

This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action; where the defendant has been glimpsed only in a single brief shot; where logic, emotion and prejudice struggle to control the field. It is a masterpiece of stylized realism--the style coming in the way the photography and editing comment on the bare bones of the content.",9
24 January 2005,Classic!!,"This film is an absolute masterpiece. No fancy stuff, one room and 12 marvelous performances. The script is awesome and Fonda (Davis) is the coolest character I've ever seen on screen, cooler even than A Maverick or A Corleone or a Dirty Harry. I suppose it's all been said already about this film....My number 2 favorite Film ever, after The Good, bad the ugly. Lee J Cobb I suppose was the next most important character and it seemed like a battle between him and Fonda. I think Fonda's coolest and classiest part was when he showed that even after Cobb had threatened to kill him and all the hostility Cobb showed him throughout, he still offered Cobbs coat at the end. He didn't bear a grudge, cool right to the end. Really this film was about how people from different back rounds and professions interact when placed on an equal footing.

6 November 2020,"Deep, Meaningful and full of Creativity","One of the most easy picks as a masterpiece its 12 angry men. its a small and a big movie same time. small, for location, and big for humanity and art. just think about location. how many directors could made a movie like this? with one location for the whole time, you were absolutely not being bored any single minute of the movie. it is a superb job done by Sidney Lumet. rest in peace Sidney, cause your movie consider as a simple of magnum opus of art. and the other way, think about plot and story and characters and intention of peoples for judge. this movie teach you right way of thinking, right doubting, and care about someone's life. honestly 12 angry men is a top product of human kind.

1 August 2013,i just wonder why i didn't get my hands on this movie earlier itself???,"well, i was just checking out the ""IMDB Top 250"" and came across this movie...well i can see why this movie has gained its spot over there.!! So here it goes!!!

The movie is as such a very simple one!!!Twelve jurors trying to determine whether or not a boy is guilty of his father's murder.So i was wondering how could such a simple plot could have made it to the top 250.

But i was just plain wrong.I was astonished by the way this film was made.Excellent dialogues, wonderful shots, great characterization, brilliant editing, and some mind blowing performances by the all the actors put together made this masterpiece possible.

To everyone out there who still has not seen this movie--------better grab a copy soon, sit back and enjoy this masterpiece!!!

14 April 2012,One for the ages,"First I'll start off by saying that I'm only 20, which in itself should say something about my rating of the movie. I'm not some old guy reviewing based on nostalgia or anything like that.

They really don't make movies like this anymore. There are no twists, there are no turns, there are no explosions, and there are no special effects. What you get here is a smart, dialogue driven tale about 12 men burdened with the fate of a young Hispanic man. Something you don't see too often these days is a brilliantly written script. 98% of this movie takes place in one room, and thus relies on character interaction and dialogue and nothing more. It reminds us that there is more to life than whats on the surface, something we often forget.

It reminds me of a movie like Clerks. Obviously a completely different type of movie, but at its root is quite similar. Smart, subtle, and character-driven (and black & white which is kind of beside the point). Most everyone can identify with one of the jurors. The skeptic, the racist, the conformist, the indifferent. We all know people like this, and you'll likely find yourself identifying with one or more of the jurors.

So many around my age would immediately dismiss this film because of its simplicity and because its understated. I feel quite sorry for them. The film is quite compelling and you really get sucked into the life of a juror in a murder trial. Don't dismiss this film because of its lack of color or anything superficial. Easily one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and there is a reason its rated so high. Do yourself a favor. See it. Then see it again.",9
17 August 2016,"Simple, yet powerful","I've heard a lot about this movie before eventually watched it. Everybody keeps saying this is a must-seen movie. And I hereby agree to all those people that saying this so far because this movie is really a must-see movie. The plot is very simple, yet the details of the movie are very neat. It is incredible to see how this simple can expand into something so much more interesting and keeps me going as long as the movie goes on. Also the fact that the movie only takes place in one small room and all those conversation that happens between these 12 jurors just make me amaze how amazing this movie is. I cannot take my eyes of the screen just for a second. Watching every juror in the room exchanging the conversation really makes me feel like I was in that room with them, It's like watching them playing ping-pong that goes back and forth back and forth and it's getting more intense each time any one open up their mouths. Overall this one small movie changes my view towards my experience in watching movies forever. You don't need a good location, big plot, special features and all those crap to make a good movie. All you need is just a simple plot but brilliant enough to keep the audience captivated and you're all good.",10
17 September 2017,Viewer is the 13th Angry man!!,"The recipe was ready and the control to prepare the food was given to viewer's eyes and senses, that's the risk a film maker takes when he decides to make a movie like 12 Angry Men, where the whole control to imagine each incidents of a crime mystery is provided to the viewer.When you see the first nearly 6 and a half minutes of a masterpiece long shot, you are quite convinced that this film is in great hands. As the movie progresses, the story got a hold of you so tight that after some point you start thinking like a jury and become the 13th Angry Man who wants to solve this case. What wins over everything is a strong plot with a brilliantly written screenplay. It's not so easy to write a mystery drama occurring inside a single room and let the viewer picturing every details through dialogues, but full marks to Reginald Rose for keeping the screenplay so tight with minute details of each incident that everything comes so easy as if they are happening in front of the eyes . The direction is so perfect that you are convinced that the whole movie is shot in a single day, there could not have been a better story telling than this, where the plot demands it. What makes the movie more interesting is the director's approach to arrange long shots which are acted brilliantly by everyone. Henry Fonda stands out of the crowd with a calm and composed act and justified his role to the fullest. A special mention goes to the make up department which kept in check the sweating of each character, though not so much of an importance but that provides a feeling of continuity in the movie. One special mention of the bathroom scene where one of the jury flips the cigarette, which is executed flawlessly and you wonder how many takes it's gonna take to make that scene to perfection.

Not everyday you watch a movie like 12 Angry Men and not everyday you get the satisfaction to call a movie ""A Masterpiece"", well, today is the day. There will never be a replacement to this movie where Screenplay and Direction are real actors. This movie sets a clear example that a good plot and a good story telling makes masterpieces, other departments just becomes secondary though necessary elements in a movie.",10
4 December 2000,A Wonderful True Classic,"This is one of the most flawless and well acted films i have ever seen - never less then compelling from start to finish.

All twelve actor deliver Oscar worthy performances.

Sure - Fonda was given first billing - and rightfully so as he was clearly the main character in the film -but 3 other characters steal the show.

Ed Begley (Juror 10) an excellent portrayal of a racist bigot and his racist tirade at the end is one of the highlights especially when everyone gets up and leaves the table - (except Warden and Marshall - who are disgusted but can bear to hear it.)

E.G. Marshall (Juror 4) - The most intelligent juror that maintains his guilty plea to the end whilst the other 2 have prejudices. He will not be swayed by Fonda - and he genuinlely believes the boy is guilty - great acting by marshall.

Lee J Cobb (Juror 3) - I was blown away by the stunning emotional, electrifying performance that Cobb effortlessly gives - some actors can shout - but Cobb can SHOUT like no-one else - ""Everything in this case HAS BEEN TWISTED"" Oh so realistic - and his final tirade was the best moment in the film.

A brilliant character study - and the epitome of great acting

11 April 2012,One of the most engaging and genuine films i've ever seen.,"I can't praise this film highly enough.

From the very beginning you are forced into the debate by the subtle camera work and superb acting. At various points throughout the film and used delicately the actor in focus is directed to speak into the camera, it has an engaging effect in which you feel yourself become part of the Jury. You feel the tension between characters as opinions begin to change.

The characters themselves are so cleverly developed that even after small amount of dialogue you can see the cross section of society sitting around the table becoming apparent, a very ordinary group of men, ordinary in such a way that anyone watching this film would be able to identify with at least one of them, each one having a slight difference in attitude. There are no bad guys or good guys, nothing is forced. All you see is mostly people who initially believe they are right with their views.

The film centres around the jury beginning to question the defence given to the accused. Initially it falls to just one juror played by Henry Fonda who is not happy to proceed with a verdict until it's been fully discussed, albeit to the annoyance of the the remaining jurors who are convinced and willing to give a guilty verdict. As the prosecution case is slowly pulled part and the views of the jurors alter, it's not just the case at hand which is affected but the general attitudes of each one of them, prejudice and insecurity is brought out into the open as the up bringing of the accused is discussed.

There are no weak spots acting wise, everything falls into place, is delivered to perfection and blends seamlessly. I do think Lee J. Cobb deserves an extra mention though for his performance in this film, it's truly outstanding.

This film is a genuine masterpiece, a true cinema experience that should be watched by as many people as possible.

9 November 2018,Maximum out of minimum,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e.

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

28 January 2012,Good FIlm,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.

The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this? Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",10
28 April 2023,This movie should be shown in high schools.,"Are you a person of strong convictions? Do you stick to your ideals firmly if someone questions them? Do you passionately defend your way of thinking just because it defines and identifies you? Well, this may seem normal and correct to some people, but it may also seem aberrational to others. 12 Angry Men shows us how important it is to at least consider having doubts about our own truth, which, said in this way, is already in question because it's your truth and not that of others. Absolute truths can never be subjective, nor be subject to prejudice, nor be blindly defended, because, even if the adjective is absolute, truths can be broken.

This film is an excellent exercise that leads us to think a lot. Facts, truths, certainties, points of view, evidence, versions, accusations, prejudices, convictions, acquittals. The 12 men who sat down to decide the fate of an alleged culprit, whose fate may be the dead herself, end up showing their true colors by presenting their arguments.

The film is superbly done, starting with a very well orchestrated sequence shot in a small location. This wasn't an impediment to show an exquisite photograph based on lights, shadows, contrasts and environments that showed that even the weather was another character in the film. The direction was impeccable, the performances were good, if a bit stiff and packed at times. My rating is not higher, because there are details such as the soundtrack, production design, costumes, etc., which are well executed, but they don't really stand out. Everything is in its place and contributes in a good way, but in films like these, clearly what stands out is the script and a couple of particular extras, such as direction and photography.

Now, I really love movies like this that give us something to think about. They provide us with that teaching quota that only good instances leave. The characters and their decisions allow for an extensive analysis, but despite being a film from the year 57, I wouldn't want to say anything, so that everyone who can, sees it without knowing in advance everything that is discussed and acquired here.

Recommended for everyone who can think and discern clearly.",8

30 April 2020,12 Angry Men,"Rose - Lumet's high theater on attitudes that often bedevil jury deliberation: Sloth (J7) and prejudice (10) are well-known, but also bias (Fonda (8) acting as defense co-counsel in creating unreasonable doubts and effectively stopping his co-jurors from further reflection to push the group-think as Cobb (3) had done earlier) and the struggle all jurors should engage by being objective while ultimately forming a conviction.

The men first appear, eleven, anyway, too quick to convict, then fall like dominoes, too easy to acquit, running hot or cold, acceding to whichever advocate (J3 or 8) has his air-of-authority turned on high. It's a trying watch in grade below Lumet's 1982 gem, The-Verdict (wtih jurors Warden & Binns), that opens with a mawkish camera pan to beg our sympathy for a defendant of whom we know nothing, and ends by leaving the impartial viewer feeling that maybe justice was not done after-all. But there's plenty of passion with the power to make us think, and that's always a plus.

And it's worth keeping this in mind when watching and being moved to-and-fro by the passions at play: It's fair to judge the personalities of the 12 jurors, to a point, and the workings of their deliberations, but their value as such and any vote they render either early or late in the process is completely within their own purview as they in the story sat through the trial and we the viewers did not, excepting the judge's flat closing instruction. It might then be wise to not vest heavily on the guilt question (2.5/4).",5
17 May 2017,Highly Recommended,"It's like I was reading a text book on the importance of observation, science of deduction and emotional maturity. This is the very reason Hollywood rocks. No fancy words and no ambiguous expression of ideas. Explaining things to viewers and educating them at the same time without compromising on ANY elements of film-making. Absolutely fantastic!

9 February 2020,The Perfection of Character Interaction,"12 very believable multifaceted characters in form of 12 men of differing backgrounds and classes of American society discuss a murder case in a court room. While interacting they develop throughout the movie by everyone forming his own opinion on the case at hand. Funny, emotional and thrilling till the very end.

One of the true classics in filmmaking with lots of rewatch value.

21 August 2014,What a great movie,"this movie was a masterpiece.

there's no an expensive special effect, a blow car

the life of a human being deserves to be saved even if the person is the most evil people on earth. it is what makes a human being human.

respect for life and respect it. This movie made me learn if human life is important for sustained

despite the end of this movie was predictable, but the film deserves to be in waiting until the end.

I advise you to watch this movie because it deserves to be on the watch. and make us learn if it is worth a human life on hold. but there is one side that makes me ask what if it turns out the child is guilty?

it would be a boomerang for us, is not it?",10
31 December 2003,Heart Stopping,"The suspense in this B/W one room movie is incredible I dont think there is a director today who could pull it off...no cast of millions no special computer effects or back rounds ..Not even a good story line to be honest. Just some amazing men and an incredible amount of talent...

8 December 2014,Great movie,"The other reviews pretty much sums it up. It's a great movie, that really proves that 12 good actors is all you need to make a top notch movie. It might be old, slow and sometimes really predictable; but for a movie from 1957 it might be the first movie to ever do anything like this. If not the first; it's the first one to nail it.

If you are going to sit down and watch this movie, do not expect a movie with a lot of cool movie effects, because it doesn't have any. People nowadays seem to think that a movie is slow and not good if it goes more than 2 minutes without any action. In this movie they, as mentioned earlier, proves that if the movie has a good lineup of actors, and a good manuscript/director; and set your mind to it, you start putting yourself into the mind of the actors as real people and not actors.

That alone makes this better than most movies I've ever watched.

18 September 2016,review about 12 angry men,"Films is brilliant no words,simple story but it gave tot of thing about human mind,actor in it gave a great performance

Following the closing arguments in a murder trial, the 12 members of the jury must deliberate, with a guilty verdict meaning death for the accused, an inner-city teen. As the dozen men try to reach a unanimous decision while sequestered in a room, one juror (Henry Fonda) casts considerable doubt on elements of the case. Personal issues soon rise to the surface, and conflict threatens to derail the delicate process that will decide one boy's fate.The 12 Angry Men are a jury, a body of peers chosen to decide the guilt or innocence of a teenager accused of murdering his father. They have heard the arguments of the district attorney and the defense lawyer. They have received instructions from the presiding judge. Now they are on their own. What will they do?

8 October 2005,"A Script, A Cast, and Some Film","Twelve Angry Men is a testament to what a good director can do with little more than a good script and a room full of fine actors. Almost the entire film takes place in a single room - the jury room of a murder trial during deliberations. There's no need for spoilers here as the plot is obvious once you know the premise - the various characters try to convince the others as the balance ebbs and flows toward guilty or not guilty. You'll probably even quickly guess the final result, but as is often the case, the journey is more interesting than the destination. There aren't any gunfights, chase scenes, eye candy, or special effects bonanzas - just the dialog between the jurors. 12 Angry Men was made with 12 Fine Performances by 12 Exceptional Actors.

7 August 2018,Oxymoronic Feelings on the content.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",7

12 August 2016,Great Movie,"This movie is a Great because the drama is genuine and it takes place in just one room. The fact that it was black & white made it even better. I hope to get this on Blu-ray. I remember watching this in school and often those movies they show at school are boring. This kept me engaged because the acting was great. The tension from all the characters arguing made for a great film. They didn't rely on any special effects which is a nice change. I hope more people get a change to enjoy this film. They re-made this film a number of years later and it had Tony Danza in the film. It was OK but it didn't have evoke the same tension of the original film

20 August 2013,A movie that would make you Conscious on how the observation is subjective to the observer!!!!,"A setting that had all the things that would bore anyone to death; 1. Characters : Just 12 2. Location(s) : Inside a room 3. Stunts : No 4. Comedy : No 5. Romance : No 6. Graphics : No 7. Superstars : Strictly No

With all the deficiencies mentioned above, the moment you play the movie you'll completely get hooked to the movie that you'll even forget your popcorn! There is an under current social commentary which depicts how people of different social strata look at a thing/incident subjective to their social, professional background. The way people would react to an incident based on their own experience. And ultimately the rationale individual who tries to see through the things based on pure judgement than being emotionally restricted! A must watch entertainer for all types of movie goers!

5 November 2013,Charged for being a magnificent movie,"Great acting, great story... Beautiful in its simplicity, while being it extremely challenging to transcend to such a great quality movie for which most part takes place in just one room. A room filled with 12 diverse people who try to reach unanimity in deciding if an 18-year old man is guilty of killing his father. Just one person having doubt about his guilt, trying to convince the others to not take the decision of death penalty lightly and rethink all the evidence they have seen during the course of the trial. Every person having their own personal history coloring the way they look at one another, giving rise to prejudice, and guiding their interactions with others. Besides being a joy to watch the story and interactions unfold, it's a nice lesson in humidity and self-consciousness about how we can mislead ourselves, how we can be so certain, when the only certainty is uncertainty (although I realize this is a contradictio in terminis).

What fantastic acting by the leads especially but also by every supporting character. 12 great characters stuck in a room together, with different viewpoints. A great mystery and story and a fantastic ending. This movie is a simple drama on its surface but is perfectly executed, what a perfect dramatic film!

7 June 2006,"One of the best, if not THE best, courtroom drama in the history of cinema.","Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" is a film that would never appeal to me because of its old age and its black and white film, but once I started watching this, I couldn't help but get sucked in with everything unraveling in the jury room. There are no small characterization among the 12 jurors, with each one having a lot of resonance and importance to the story, something I found very well done thanks to Reginald Rose's script. Even though I think each of the 12 jurors are very well-characterized, the two that stood out in my mind are Juror #8 (played by Henry Fonda) and Juror #3 (played by Lee J. Cobb). Juror #8 is the main protagonist out of the 12, simply because he's the one who stood for the 18 year old Hispanic kid, who's convicted of murdering his father, from the very beginning. His determination and graceness carries throughout the film, and Henry Fonda played wonderfully in this role. Lee J. Cobb's Juror #3, the main antagonist of the film, is the definition of arrogance and ignorance. This is the film that should make Lee J. Cobb as one of the biggest defining actors in Hollywood history, and his performance as Juror #3 is very, very memorable. One of the big reasons why I didn't really enjoy watching ""black and white"" movies are that they feel too slow and have too much reliance on talking, but this one is an exception. Even though the movie is all talk, I found that the script is very, very well written and kept the tension going among the 12 jurors and its final outcome. Each character is distinctly different, with some similarities but also some differentiation, which makes each of the characters believable and relatable in one way or the other. The story, although strictly a courtroom drama, really gives a rather worldly aura within the interaction between the different jurors, since each juror has their own story to tell in relations to the conviction of the 18 year old Hispanic boy. Even though this is the only film I saw from Sidney Lumet, I can tell that if this is one of the movies considered classic, then I've missed out on others as well. He has done a very good job with keeping the story flowing and doesn't direct any jarring moments within the only place the jurors are in throughout the whole movie (the jury room). He kept the jury process interesting and engaging, something other courtroom drama didn't really do right. All in all, this should be the film that set the standard of courtroom drama. I don't think any film surpass ""12 Angry Men"" in that regard, so I think this should be on any serious film collector's collection. Sidney Lumet's masterpiece garners a 10/10 and is in my opinion the best courtroom drama ever filmed (unless I've missed out on others).",10
12 December 2019,Greatest black and white film,"So where do I start. the first time I saw this film i was amazed by the strong dialogue, the acting is spot on, the directing is amazing and the actors did a tremendous job. A young Syndey Lumet directed this and I never seen anything like this, so this movie is so powerful it teaches life itself so its my all time vaforite film and also one of the best ever!I don't usually rate any movies, but this, I couldnt' help it but give it a 10, its a powerful movie, one of a kind

29 September 2014,Enthralling,"Very impressed by this, somehow an entire movie that is largely set in one room and almost completely dialogue based, they have managed to make extremely exciting and fast paced.

The characters and the script are brilliant. All 12 characters are all so unique, so while the movie is in black and white, the characters contrast each other like orange and blue.

The way the plot of the murder trial unfolds through pure dialogue and confrontation is nothing short of amazing. I look forward to trawling through more classics as this movie has gotten me over my hesitation to watch older movies.

8 October 2014,Amazing movie with a lot of thought,"Have you ever taken decisions rashly and screwed up in the process? The whole movie is based on this ideology. Most people judge an old film as something which won't be worth watching but 12 Angry Men changed the way I see films. Take note; besides one or two shots this whole film was shot in one place. You're always trying to think ahead while watching this movie and it got me deeply invested in the plot. From the start I was rooting for the protagonist to win and with the amazing script and actors I don't think anything could have gone wrong.

Lovely movie, There's a reason why its in the top 250 IMDb list. This must watch deserves all the stars it can get.

2 October 2016,remarkable work of Sidney Lumet,"its a kind of movie , make a sense of strange feeling with bad mind to watching it , and soon you sitting to watch it fascinating you with Dialogues and Acting.

for me its best acting by Henry Fonda for its absorbing and catching you to depths of their arguments.

in my opinion its most remarkable work of Sidney Lumet with one location !!(the room ) Lumet's film has instructional value as a study of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the jury system, but its real value is how it allows each member of the cultural mosaic of a jury to develop into distinct, damaged, and interesting characters. In a well-crafted metaphor for the broader outline of society, the jury members must confront their prejudices in order to see that justice prevails

during the movie you encounter with 2 side of judgment and try to judge with your LAW! its one of best dialogue driven movie you should Watch",9
9 March 2014,One of the few perfect movies..,"What can I say about this achievement in film making that has not been said before.

It takes a simple concept (12 jurors must come to the conclusion of guilty or not guilty) and completely twists it on its head.

Brilliant use of the one room setting (very few films can pull this off) and excellent acting from the cast all around.

Many people I know have discarded this movie claiming that it is too talky yet love movies like ""Pulp Fiction"". This is one of the movies where if you really just sit there and listen to the dialogue, it becomes a very intense experience where you are on the edge of your seat.

I can honestly say that I do not have any problems with this movie. It is a thoroughly intense ride that is a must see for all lovers of film.",10
29 March 2023,This is Cinema,"If you think 12 men sitting in a lifeless room discussing a murder case for one and a half hours is going to be boring, get ready to be proven wrong.

After a murder trial, one man on the jury votes not guilty to avoid a false verdict and suggests that the case isn't as clear-cut as it seems.

This script is layered and the characters diverse. Every single person is realistic and giving appropriate time to show exactly what they are about.

The arguments are vivid and intelligent. Characters aren't dumbed down for the sake of making others look smart. As soon as you think one character outsmarted the other, they come up with a logical counter that forces them to rethink their position. And although they are in a room with nothing more than a few chairs and a table throughout the entire thing, they find vivid ways to visualize, or tell the story verbally.

This film is a must-watch. It's a great character study and if you're trying to get yourself or somebody else into classic films, this one is an easy watch to get you started.

Absolutely phenomenal!",10

11 July 2003,Why things may have been better then.......,"This has to be one of the best movies ever made of any type. Henry Fonda leads the cast but there are so many powerful performances that it is unfair to just mention a couple and not the rest. Today, no jury in America would be comprised of 12 white men....perhaps that is why the judicial system is in the mess it is in today....Jury nullification would not tolerate such a jury, and that is probably why there will not be any Henry Fondas on today's juries.

Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

6 April 2009,"Simple yet complex, basic yet superb","Great films don't need to be multi-millionaire productions to be remembered for the rest of the eternity by everyone who has seen them(or by everyone who has seen all the spoofs on TV). This movie is a major proof of this principle. ""12 Angry Men"" is theater on the big screen: one single scenery during most of the film (except at the end), real-time narrative, 12 characters involved: 1 is your favorite because he represents all the good ideals (honesty, loyalty, etcetera) and the philosophy of Descartes: doubt about everything they tell you. By the other hand, there's also the complete opposite of this hero: racist, closed, liar and cold-blooded. Simple basic theatrical characters, written to make people think. Why does this work in this film? Because the script is so well written that you don't care about anything else than being on Henry Fonda's side during the entire feature. And of course, trying to enter to the movie and shoot Lee J. Cobb's character. Usually, when I watch a movie, I try to pay attention to every detail: direction, writing, editing, photography, etcetera. But this one kept me on the edge of the seat the whole time, waiting for the final verdict to come. You don't even care if the film is in black an white or whether it has no music at all. Well, my final verdict: 1 charge for being entertaining through and through, another charge for being impeccably written and directed, and 2 extra charges for being very good acted.",10
3 December 2018,One of the best drama films of all time,"All twelve actors who portray the twelve jury's were amazing. They always had clashing ideas which you could point out and their development as characters who were very real human beings were embodied well in this drama. A great film !

11 October 2014,Aspiring Directors must watch this movie,"Too few film directors today ever learned how to direct actors. This film is the perfect example of why having the skill to direct an entire story, taking the time to rehearse and getting actors off page, can take a story confined to a tiny space and make it one of the top films of all time. There is room for special effects and action sequences but as long as directors take the time and put in the care to make quiet moments solid pieces of acting then even spectacle films can be critically acclaimed. Kevin Feige of Marvel has made it a point to cast great actors in superhero films even when the choice might have seemed unlikely. The reason is he knows great acting makes for a great film. Aspiring Directors, if you do not have great actors you can still get good performances out of your actors. Learn from this film. Focus on story and focus on how it is told which is primarily done by the actors.

22 December 2014,"12 Angry Men, 1 Happy Me","I rarely say a film is perfect, but this one just might. If you haven't seen it yet, turn off your laptop or whatever, go to the nearest store that sells DVDs (I have no idea if it exists in BluRay) and buy it (downloading is bad !). Then, sit on your freaking couch and watch the darn film ! (Or whatever, just see it ASAP).

This ""huis-clos"" is absolutely brilliant ! The acting's great, the plot is smart, the characters' portraits throughout the movie are very interesting (mostly because they're all different).

I have waited a long time before seeing it, never quite finding the motivation to do so. I really can't explain why ! Maybe partly because I was afraid it would have aged too much... but I was entirely wrong.

I had seen a play with the same plot, and loved it as well. I'm glad I finally watched the film, and I invite you to do the same !",9

26 September 2015,Society and Morals Clash,"This timepiece of Americas' societal history, which illustrates the differing opinions of the average citizen, brings to light the influence on a persons' opinion, based on the collective opinion.

""12 Angry Men"" also demonstrates the sheer will that a person must maintain, to defend not simply their opinion, but the facts.

The exhausting twist of opinion and the cinematic presentation will leave any viewer sweating in their seat.

This movie is a must-see classic! I personally watched this in grade school as a class requirement, and had to write an essay about it. I can only hope that schools continue to show this to kids in high school. Seeing this film as a young man or woman can only help our youth to realize that their actions as an individual are judged by different people in different ways. It is important for an individual to realize that every one of their actions result in both an equal and opposite reaction.",10
22 May 2020,Incredible,"A film that provokes us to think about the depthof what it means to be human, to be humanity. Technically, it's almost a masterpiece. Consider the difficulty of shooting an entire movie in a single setting, a room wrapped between walls and windows, and doing it in an interesting way! For the secret of this achievement is in fact the exploration that took place in this film, which presents us in images various perspectives, various angles - images and angles dependent on the emotional load of the moment.

Then the message. Which I do not intend to explore, because the viewer will be in charge of doing so, of interpreting the film in their own way.

This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, loaded with subtlety and mastery.

16 January 2020,A 2020 review,"Quite an Impressive movie even after years and years of it's relase it's always a piece of art... There are no amazing graphics or CGI the cinematic part is very simple black and white video and 95% of the movie is only in one room yet the script and the plotwists are chockingly good... During the movie you get to know the 12 men and understand their unger and it's written in a way that let's you imagine your own versions of the things that they're talking about and opens up ways for your own creativity the movie could make a great debate if you watch it with a group. But my review is 100% positive.

12 April 2020,A cinema within a room,"A young guy accused of killing his father and the decision of capital punishment hangs in the hands of the 12 angry men who are appointed as the jury in this case. Every man among them wants to deal with this case as soon as possible by voting for the capital punishment but one young man is unsatisfied with the circumstantial evidence that was put forth by the state. As the story revolves only around these twelve men angrily arguing with each other as the young man finds it hard to make the other jurors to believe that there is not enough proof to sentence that guy to death. A unique drama created within a room and few characters without names is surely to make an long lasting effect in the audiences' mind.

This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note. I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

24 November 2015,Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....by Sydney Lumet,"Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!

When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.

So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.

This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor....",9

19 March 2016,As good as it gets,"Initially the movie started with one of the jurors questioning the alibi of the prosecuted kid and then there are the rest of the jurors turning a blind eye to the mundane matter until they are utterly convinced and quit being petulant and more serious cumulatively.

Governed with profound analysis of the investigations at the crime scene they not only prove to themselves but to the entire audience the actual unrealized truth of the situation at hand. The overall cast of the jurors is absolutely pristine and I bet that halfway through it you wouldn't shut this movie to do something important, you will see how potent this movie is.

If your binge on old movies is about to begin, kindly start with this one without any reservation.

1 September 2023,Against the Grain,"It seems that this movie is unanimously a masterpiece, a 9/10, and according to the list, the #5 best movie of all time according to IMDB.

I'm going to be the dissenting juror to this conviction. While the movie is undoubtedly very good for its time and for being a black and white movie, I believe it is overrated at its score and where it sits in the top 5. I'm astonished this is as high ranked and rated actually.

It's like the jurors in the room pressuring everybody to side with their opinion, and anybody who doesn't agree with their assertion is outcasted and must give into peer pressure and consent to a 9/10. However, not me, I give this very good movie a 7/10, and I could see it in the 90-100 ranked range, maybe the 50 range at best.

There is practically no action, no big twists, and no grand surprises. There were just a couple of scenes such as where Fonda's character pulls out the knife or when the angry juror demonstrates the angle of the knife on Fonda that created some tension, but most of it is too even and simplistic to be considered great. Sure, the arguments brought up by the characters were often interesting and valid, but they were just using step by step logic that wasn't overly cerebral. That's fine, but the point is that there was no big mindblowing 'aha' moment. It was just a step by step chiseling of the evidence that was again interesting at some times, but at others it was just basic.

There was definitely a lot to learn from in this movie in terms of how a jury works if one has never been on one, as well as how the system works regarding arriving at verdicts. I'm sure for its time, it was very enlightening for people unfamiliar with the constitution, and even today there are timeless elements to the study of the situation.

I have one more minor criticism. While Fonda's acting was good, I found his character to be a little bit too much portrayed like an angel. The director even has him place the most angry juror's jacket on him at the end, and the camera just about solely focuses in on him at the end. They didn't even include the reading of the final verdict or show the boy's or the attorneys' reactions or the courtroom's. I mean, come on, Fonda's character may have just convinced eleven other men to let the culprit walk free, and yet the director paints him as a basically perfect person, like an angel. I think this betrays the script in a sense because there was ample evidence that the boy was guilty, not because of the pathetic prejudicial arguments or preconceptions of character, but because of some other key pieces of evidence. For example, just because juror four can't remember the exact name of the movie he saw or struggles to recall the actor names shouldn't be enough to disregard the boy's statements. I'm not saying he was definitely guilty, but the way the script was playing out, I don't think it was clear enough to pain Fonda's character as this perfect person the way they did, especially at the end, although this could be a trope of the times in the 1950's to always have a hero be idealized.

In summation, it is a very good movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again as it is rather monotonous with very little action if any at all and very few twists. Still, I'm glad I watched it once and would put it in the top 30 or so of black and white movies, but definitely not in the top 5 movies of all time. Just off the top of my head, Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Gone With the Wind are better older movies than this was.",7
12 September 2023,THE MOST INTERESTING MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.,"This is a masterpiece. It is an example of a perfect film made without many resources, with the exception of the trial scene, and the first moments and the final scene is a film that practically only has one scenario.

An excellent script, with a simple story. But what impressed me most here, with the exception of the obvious script, is the editing and camera movement. The film could have been filmed with the camera still, when a character would speak then it cut to him, but no, the director played with the camera and that helped make the film perfect from my point of view, for me this is a perfect film. And certainly indispensable for those who are starting to study cinema.

10 December 2013,My favorite!,"My friend, Tejas, recommended the movie '12 Angry men' to me. Frankly, till then I had never heard about such a movie. He then said that it is an old B&W movie made in late 1950′s. But the reason I really got interested in this recommendation was because, he mentioned that the whole movie was shot in a single room – in a single setting.

The movie takes off brilliantly from the start. The characters and their personalities are gradually disclosed to the viewer as and when required. The cast of actors have done their part remarkably well, though at times it seems that Henry Fond does steal his moments (Henry Fonda was also the co-producer of the movie). Apart from the unique situation, that of a jury in a criminal case with a split verdict, in which the movie is set, it is also the dialogues (or the arguments of the case) that keeps us hooked to the screen. There is no moment where there is a distraction or a chance for the viewer to yawn. The brilliant pace, the heated debates, the moments of short surprises keeps us interested till the very end. It's a masterpiece and I would recommend this as a 'MUST WATCH'!

I am keeping this review short without even giving the synopsis of the film, so as to let you enjoy the film.

Happy Viewing .",10
12 January 2018,12 Angry Men is an example to be watched!,"""12 Angry Men"" sticks you to the screen and never lets you go with its dialogue, scene blocking, and acting. This movie is an emotional rollercoster by Lumet and it all happens in a single room. While in other films this choice would make it more monotonous in this one it makes it more compelling, making you thing with the characters about the case and the boy's innocence. I feel that if this movie was made nowadays it would probably have a reenactment scene of the murder or some kind of plot twist, like: He was guilty all along and Henry Fonda is character was his friend making fake evidences trying to make him look innocent.

13 August 2023,A masterpiece in storytelling,"I'll never forget the first time I watched 12 Angry Men, around 15 years ago when I was a high schooler. It was an expertly dubbed version playing in the local network in my then very small television. I can recall being dumbfounded, in total awe of what was being shown to my eyes. Something profound, stunning, magical. I've rewatched this many times after that, in a company of friends, family members or alone, and the effects are still there. I can still hate the racist member with my each living cells, I can still sense the tension that was there in that session, I can envy those who are about to experience this beauty for the first time. 12 Angry Men is simply a masterpiece in storytelling, I don't tend to praise films only centered around white men, but i can make an exception for this one.

6 September 2007,Proves to be a Fonda exclusive,"Let's just say, Henry Fonda was a cream pie and Lee J. Cobb was a apple pie. Both taste good. Combine together with some cherry sauce and a nice strawberry float to wash it down, you have the perfectly combined meal for tea, even if it's only a simple meal. This is the best way to describe Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. It's simple. Only three minutes of the movie was shot outside the sixteen by twenty-four 'jury room'. We expect the landscapes and the magnificent out-of-life sets and camera landscapes to grasp our awe. 12 Angry Men only has a small, dusty jury room to pull an audience. Believe me, it succeeds memorably.

The story starts as we see an 18 year old teenager is accused of murder in the first degree. Twelve jurors are assigned to handle this case. Clearly, as we see no one cares about the case, except for juror #8. His actions and thoughts that spring alive in that room is what makes this offering a fruitful and simple lesson about a man and the decisions he has to make right.

Lumet creates a ensemble cast out of thin air. 12 Angry Men is awesomely simple, touching, most of all funny. I see an even longer future ahead for this movie.",10
12 July 2017,High tension without any action,"This the first movie that made me want to write a review. This movie proves that you don't need guns,explosions,and action set pieces to keep the viewer on the tip of their seats . The tension in that small room with 12 amazing , very different characters ; each with his own different point of view.

I like how in the beginning they show every character entering the room each doing their usual business, small chats it makes the characters feel real and authentic and the situation like everyday situation. Then the anime tension begins argument that feel like fights, people changing their votes and rechanging their votes guilty not guilty..... Every argument felt like a fight Every vote felt like a major turning point in the plot . And I really like the ending scene it really makes you feel you're in there with them. One of the best ending scenes.

8 September 2023,I watched it for the ranking,"I didn't see much in the movie.

He was mildly interesting, but only mildly. There are great movies that should be in its place. I can't say anything about the acting of the unknown actors. One antagonist is very bad and holds the bone until the last. The others slowly change their opinions and finally a happy ending. If you watch it prepare yourself for one room for the whole movie. The good, on the other hand, with reason and feelings, manages to dissuade others with vague counter-evidence. Well skip it for me it won't lose you much at least it's short. I even found it translated into Bulgarian, which surprised me, but such is life. Astalavista...

24 April 2022,Quick story,"I watched this movie in my philosophy class it was shown by my teacher who was in is late 50s. He always talked about his collage days about going out with his friends and watching movies and debating them. I never really liked him and probably wouldn't think about him since i left highschool (2 years ago) but now every time i think about good cinema i think about this movie thx Professor Vitor.

20 April 2009,The Man in the White Suit,"This is simply another comment in the long line of praise for 12 Angry Men, one of the greatest films of the 1950s and one of the greatest films ever made.

It was part of a remarkable year in films, with Bridge on the River Kwai and Witness for the Prosecution.

Sideny Lumet managed to piece together a perfect cast that gave not a single poor performance. The characters acting out the tensions of class and race that would soon explode in the streets in the late 50s and 60's, in a tiny jurors room. The passion and the rage feels like it is leaping off the screen, while the 12 men are trapped in the room until each demon is confronted.

12 Angry Men is a movie about humanity, all bottled up, ready to explode. It carries around our weight, and shows how all of our experiences, all of our past never leaves us, and how truly difficult, if not impossible it is to be freed from it.",10

13 November 2018,Masterpice,"First of all, I apologize for the brevity of this review. It is such a great movie that to many words will not be able to describe it. I just will say that this is one of the true great classic movies that still resonates today, a movie that shows that no great production nor several hours of screen are needed to create something marvelous that make you question the hole justice system and keep you thinking for several hours after the best 1 hour and 36 minutes you will ever spend in front of a screen.

2 October 2006,Fine example of the golden age of Hollywood,"Recently my housemate and I had a film marathon involving SCANNERS and TRUE LIES, two films I have seen before and will see again. After these two he suggested '12 Angry Men' a film I had never heard of before and wasn't really in the mood for. I was very wrong. The film itself is excellent and a true calling card for the classic and noir period. A period where anger is displayed through shouting, not shooting, and this shouting is done using the English language...not a flurry of abuse we are so used to these days. I am blathering I know BUT this film surprised me, made me laugh, worried me, interested me and angered me, all the things that a very good film really should do.

The fact that all of this came from a film where the characters are in one room for 98% of the run time is an even bigger example of the timelessness of the piece. I will be watching this again.

9 January 2021,Guilty for being impressive,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story.

Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden.

Henry Fonda is of course excellent, but the other supporting cast members are equally great in their own particular style. Hope to watch it for another 20 years and another 20 years and another 20 years...

8 January 2023,Evolving is everything,"Psychological classic. After just seeing some cartoons adapting this classical story line, I had to watch the original. Very impressed by the acting work and all by all like mentioned a lot in the reviews the best character study I have ever watched. This movie aged very well and is still very interesting and was nerve racking. I think this movie should be showed to all psychology students. This movie could be studied by all modern civilization and will give us more insight on how the juridical system of a democracy should be handled. It really shows of how a judgemental character in a jury can ruin the ideas of the democracy.

she said it was black and white. Well after the first couple arguments, most of us in class thought it was going to get interesting. Well we were right. I thought this movie was going to be a total bore! IT REALLY WASN'T! So a word of

advice, kids watch old movies, they usually are better than these stupid action movies made these days just like i would watch the movie ""BIRDS"" which was

also a black and white movie: i would watch this movie any day over something like scary movie or ""team America"" 12 ANGRY MEN-VERY GOOD MOVIE!

11 January 2000,Fantastic 50s classic,"This is such a great movie. To think that a movie, set almost entirely in one room with nothing but twelve male jurors deliberating on their verdict for a murder trial, can be thrilling and exhilarating even though you know from the outset how the denouement will unfold! Incredible. Aside from the great performances (by each of these great actors) the standout in Twelve Angry Men is Lumet's subtle pacing and tension-building. Lumet gently leads us in to the crucial characteristics of the jurors. The interplay is wonderful and the slow realisation that there is more to this trial than previously seen is deliciously unfolded.

Atmosphere is as important as character. Watch the jurors sweat in stifling heat and then delight in the rainstorm. All the while, Fonda remains cool and calm in his white suit. A ticking clock, a wall-mounted fan and a dozen heated debaters are perfectly exploited to portray this study in prejudice, justice and humanity. The interlaced moments of comedy are very welcome too and always appropriate to the progress of plot and character.

This film writes the cinematic book on claustrophobia, perspiration, dogmatic bandstanding, small-mindedness, the power of reason and measured persuasion, the mundane games played by truly bored jurors and ultimately the belief that justice will prevail.",
5 May 2023,Watching 12 Angry Men for the first time in 2023 for ELA,"And it truly surprised me that it was actually good. I thought it was impossible that a black and white movie that truly looks and feels like it was made hundreds of years ago could actually still be good today. And sure, in my opinion 12 Angry Men doesn't deserve its #5 spot that it has on IMDb top 250 movies, but I bet it did deserve that spot when it was made. Anyways, the reason 12 Angry Men is so good is because of its idea and plot. The idea of this movie is spectacular and the plot of juror #8 slowly doing what he does throughout the movie is entertaining to watch. So while 12 Angry Men appears like some movie your grandma would tell you to watch, I'll tell you that it's actually really good.

But it would really suck you in and you just can't turn off the VCR while the story is going.. very powerful story telling and acting and directing! For those fancy special effect directors, you should really re-think of the power of good story telling!

I was going to give it an eight but I figured that since they managed to make a captivating two hour movie fit in one room they should get some extra credit. Henry Fonda is always good and Lee J. Cobb was excellent. He reminded me very much of George C. Scott, who reprised Lee J. Cobb roles in the remake of 12 Angry Men, and as the detective in the Excorcist III.

I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting.

After watching the film in its entirety, I can confidently say that it most certainly deserves this rating. I absolutely loved the creativity and ingenuity of the premise: a room filled with twelve men who have been tasked with deciding a man's fate, and the fact that the creators were able to make a feature-length film just based on this storyline. The drama, the acting, and most notably, the writing, all shine through as the situation escalates. Overall, out of all the classic movies I've watched at this time (to be fair, not many), this one is the best.

28 October 2003,A Masterpiece,"An example , along with On The Waterfront, of the excellent political-melodrama being produced by America in the 1950's. Although it is a cliche a film like this would simply not be made today by a major studio. Shot on one set, with no soundtrack, and not a handsome, or for that matter young, face to be seen it would be shoved out as an art film and seen by a few thousand people or make a lovely little TV drama. One also wonders if the modern equivalent of such a cast, could bury their egos enough to deliver such great ensemble acting.

The ethical, democratic, and political questions raised by the film are too numerous to mention. Suffice to say that you will walk away from it wanting to be a better, more responsible citizen.

24 March 2004,If you only ever watch one court drama - make it this one,"A staggeringly good film, Twelve Angry Men pits Henry Fonda against the rest of his Jurymen in an attempt to prove a young accused murderer's innocence.

First it's a great story. Its hard to go wrong when you have a great story to start with handed to you by a writer, or in this case a playwright (many have managed to do just this though). Lumet does an excellent job with the excellent tools he had to work with. He captures the claustrophobia and sweatiness of the piece perfectly, and uses cinematic tools like cuts and zooms only when appropriate. Otherwise he lets the actors do their thing. And it is the acting which raises this one to the next level.

Fonda is good here but in reality he is like the control subject in an experiment. It is the quality of all the other actors in the piece which really makes this one stand out. Every single one of them portrays a character with perfection. When you have a film set entirely in a few rooms - essentially a play adapted with camerawork, then you need to have good acting. And boy do we get it. This is a film with eleven best supporting actors and no extras. While none of the eleven might be considered a ""star"" in their own right perhaps, the proximity of the piece leads them to act off each other and give the performances of their lives.

There have been films with a lot of talented actors in them sharing a billing before and since, however, there has never been a film with such an ensemble of excellent acting on display at once in my opinion.",10
30 January 2023,Excellent film,"A master class in acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography. The development of the characters and the way the camera angles capture their changing moods and attitudes is perfection.

Henry Fonda is billed as the star because he's the best known actor in the cast. His role is the hub on which the story revolves but, each of the great character actors like Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Lee J. Cobb, John Fiedler, and Jack Warden, has his moment to shine. I can't think of a film with more a perfectly cast group of actors.

This film is well known among film buffs but, it deserves inclusion on more ""best films"" lists to bring it to the attention of more people.

1 September 2023,Old but gold,"It's mind-blowing that when I re-watched this movie, it was made almost 70 years ago. It's incredible how people back then could create something so awesome. Yeah, it's straightforward, but it achieved a lot of things that modern movies often can't touch.

Talk about nail-biting tension and suspense! ""12 Angry Men"" is like a masterclass in ratcheting up the pressure in a tiny jury room. The heat gets turned up as these jurors hash out the case.

The characters in this flick really get a chance to grow. As they argue over the guilt or innocence of the accused, their biases, prejudices, and personal stories all spill out. Watching how they change during the movie is both gripping and makes you think.

""12 Angry Men"" goes way beyond just the plot. It's a serious wake-up call about justice, prejudice, and how the legal system can be flawed. It makes you reflect on your own biases and ideas, no doubt about it.",9
12 October 2015,A Hot Debate over the Jury System,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
15 August 2000,This Movie Made me Happy,"12 ANGRY MEN

As the rain fell I realized that I wouldn't have to go to work. I checked through the movies that were coming on and noticed 12 Angry Men. In a film class I took last semester my professor showcased Sidney Lumet and showed us a bunch of his movies. However 12 Angry Men wasn't one of them. I saw Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Serpico (1973) and was entertained by both of them. Having the chance to see the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men was right up my ally. It is always interesting to watch a directors first movie.

As I began to watch 12 Angry Men I felt a strong vibe that I would be in for a treat. The movie began only steps away from where the movie would virtually take place in it's entirety. Character development was illustrated artistically and without the aid of a single name barring the closing seconds of the film. With twelve men in a hot room, Sidney Lumet did everything right. His camera gracefully wheeled around the room capturing the actors as best as possible. The movie began with an eleven to one vote on sending an eighteen year old kid to the chair. As the movie progressed the number reversed itself slowly. Henry Fonda was the one that everybody first looked at and felt angst against. He was the only one holding them away from breaking out of a hot room filled with 12 men. Fonda showed strength and confidence in his belief that chance is worth a lot. This takes a great stake in any case but with the life of a man on the line it's the greatest stake of all. Fonda supported his belief that it was possible for this young man to be innocent with a host of supporting evidence. As he went through his arsenal he swayed all eleven other men to agree with him that the young man should not be killed. The cast around Fonda was amazing. The film portrayed a theater like essence and each character took the stage and performed with consistency and great poise. Each time a character came to a point where they may have seemed to be stumbling they were picked up by another character.

Watching this movie did a lot more for me then mostly all the movies that are being released in today's age of movies. I had the pleasure to see Sidney Lumet speak at Al Pacino's birthday party at Lincoln Center and although he only commented on Al and his ability, I am now fully beginning to realize just how good of a director Sidney is himself. A tremendous eye and ability to get the best from his actors makes him one of my favorites.

12 Angry Men is not a good movie but a great movie. Shot in black and white and within the confines of a few rooms and a short closing shot outside the courthouse, Lumet mastered what he had to work with. With two weeks of rehearsal the actors polished their roles and the film eventually turned out to be a success then and now. This is the type of movie I would recommend to someone that isn't only interested in special effects, sex or explicit violence. The movie was well written and directed and should be viewed by anyone who enjoys theater. If I were asked to elaborate on why I rate this movie so well this is what I would say. The movie had twelve men at each other's throats. Each man began with a vote and all but one changed his mind. For a man to give up his initial decision a lot must happen. For some of the men in this movie it wasn't so hard to change their vote. For other's it came down to extreme matters. Some of the men were attracted to sending this kid to his death because of other reasons. The last man to change his mind was obviously torn by the the case because he and his son had gotten into a fight and have since not spoken to one another. This silently played a roll in his head throughout the movie but was finally captured when he ripped up a picture of him and his son. As he changed his vote ending the drawn out debate of this kid's fate, he shed his own tears over the loss of his son.

Another man who was slow to change his mind, based the case on himself. He figured in his head that the alibi that the young man had was not sound. Yet when put under the spotlight by Fonda he found himself in a hole. He eventually went on to change his vote but was stuck on his own belief for a while. Once a man decided to think one way he is usually in it pretty deep. For him to change his mind and say uncle he must be proven wrong or embarrassed. I can't say enough about the characters in this movie. They all had something unique about them. They all played an important part and shed new light on the matter at hand. I wonder to myself just how many characters a movie can have with them all showing importance. In this movie it was clear that 12 men was right on the money.",
11 April 1999,As tense as an elastic band around the moon!,"'12 Angry Men' is what good, quality film making is all about. It doesn't rely on lavish sets or special effects. It is a dramatic piece which needs no more than a stage. Though it is the script and performances which what carry it along. Performances by two of these actors, Henry Fonda and E.G. Marshall are unrivalled. Now I won't bother telling you what it's about. That's for you to find out, but what I can tell you is that this film despite its low budget gives us more than a few things to think about. What is justice? Could we in deciding the life of another remove all our prejudices and resist the herd mentality? But as well as a superb script, which gives the film so much intensity and passion, there is the amazing camera work and the little known trick whereby throughout the film the director (Sidney Lumet) had the walls of the already cramped set moved in very gradually so as to increase the tension. It is all these things which makes this film so good and relevant even now. I have as yet not seen the remake of this film and so therefore cannot comment on the quality of it. But as far as I can see how can anyone improve on perfection?

4 December 1999,Great movie,"This is such a great movie, a masterpiece. The plot at first would seem boring, but its not. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and it's hard for me to believe anyone would not like this one. I usually go for action movies, and this movie has a minimum of that, but it is still so wonderful and entertaining. Watch this one.

I mean, normally when I stop by Hollywood Videos, I go with Terminator, but once I decided to watch this slightly less action packed film, and it was great. Watch this movie, its a classic.

20 March 2019,"Simple, powerful and valuable lessons about negotiation","I watched this movie for class on negotiations in school and learned a lot from the characters' negotiation styles. The simple set of the jury room throughout the movie gave weight to the lines and stories of each unique character. It was a movie where the premise and outcome were predictable, but the beauty and brilliance of the movie lies in the process. Extremely enjoyable!

22 March 2019,Negotiation Techniques and Getting to YES,"Everyone has to negotiate at some point in their life. Yet, it is not always easy to convince others of your position. In the film, 12 Angry Men, we get to witness a heated scene that takes place mainly in a courtroom with a jury of 12 men. Throughout the movie, these 12 jurors deliberate and negotiate the acquittal of a defendant, an 18-year-old male who allegedly stabbed his father to death. In this negotiation, each juror has to make a choice between two options of accepting the current outcome of being ""guilty"" or join the opposing group of being ""not guilty"". In this case, some of the jurors made use of positional and principled negotiation, as discuss in the book Getting to YES by Roger Fisher, effectively to persuade the other parties. In the book, Fisher raised several problems that most negotiations face and then goes on to suggests effective solutions to overcome them. In this movie review, there are parallel between the observed negotiations made in the movie and concepts of principled negotiations discussed in the book. To sum up, 12 Angry Men is a brilliant movie that showcases a common negotiation situation that takes place in a courtroom. Particularly, I will like to applaud Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, for being a skilled negotiator where he made use of skilful negotiation techniques mentioned in Getting to YES to change the outcome of the case.",9
3 April 2019,Insights from the movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",7
27 March 2019,An exciting movie confined to a room,"This film is a classic with the cast's acting absolutely on point in capturing the emotions felt and the script was wonderfully written. The exchanges between the jurors were not carelessly written, but one written with an agenda: showcasing how human nature can cause conflict among people in a discussion. The themes explored in the movie such as negotiations and human morality has been discussed well and provides the viewer with greater insights on how merely shouting out your opinion will not change how others view a problem. I feel that there was much to be learned from this extremely insightful movie, lessons which can be put into practice in this day and age when we talk to others. Understanding each other's interests and focusing on the task at hand instead of criticising others is the way to go for discussions and ultimately will make them more efficient.

30 March 2019,A court room drama as tense as an action movie,"There are many praises for this film, it is one of the most acclaimed drama films in the last century. Whether it is the acting of Lee J. Cobb or Henry Fonda, or the camera framing by Sidney Lumet, this film is both entertaining and educational. The writing is tight, and is portrayed excellently by Henry Fonda. He plays Juror #8, the sole dissident in the voting process.

Throughout the movie, he tries to convince the rest of the jurors to listen to his side of the argument. He adopts multiple negotiation strategies, such as understanding the views of the other side and remaining calm despite the multiple personal attacks aimed at him. I've learnt a lot about the art of negotiation from this film, and despite its age, I strongly recommend this film.

2 April 2019,Amazing movie that we can learn so much from!,"As I was watching the movie ""12 Angry Men"", I was reminded of how similar it resembles our everyday interactions with one another. Although most of us are rarely confronted with such a huge decision between life and death of another as in the movie, one thing is certain - each and every one of us makes decisions daily that would have an impact on ourselves and others. Like the 12 men, each one of us has a character that is different from another - with some being more assertive than others. The movie has helped me visualised how we often look like (foolish at times) when we are ""arguing to win"" and how things can be managed better ways than just arguing with our position! This movie is like a mirror image of my interaction with others at times and it is certainly a good reminder to move towards change :)

27 November 2002,Something for us mature cineasts (SPOILING POSSIBLE),"I do not suppose that many of the pupils at the senior high where I work would appreciate this film. It features some nice things that used to be around until the '70s, but that now have been vanquished. At least from Sweden. For example:

* Respect for older people * A jury consisting of males only * Black & white film :)

WARNING! THE FOLLOWING HALF OF MY TEXT MIGHT SPOIL THE FILM FOR YOU

Even though the movie was a criminology drama, it didn't feature any twist at the ending that revolved the whole outcome of the judgment you've been building up during the whole first hour and a half. The convincing is totally linear, except for one jury member changing his mind (between the two votes 'guilty'/'not guilty') twice. I would have liked to see a script with a bit more thought behind it. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with the quality of the acting, the filming or the sound, and maybe the linear story is kind of unusual for a criminology drama. So I am going to give it a 9 out of 10.",9

26 February 2023,Classic doesn't cover this one,"For a film that was made 66 years ago it still holds up in my mind as one of the all time original classics, not because of the action like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, not because of the comedy like Monty Python Life of Brian, or the Romance like Casablanca but because it makes you use your brain and the further into the story it goes the more it makes you think ""yeah that is a good point, now they mention it"".

Admittedly this film is not for everyone, but if your one of these people who have a ""Films you need to watch at least once in your life"" list definitely make this in your Top 10, The pace of this film moves pretty smoothly, the plot is well established and the direction of the film is well shown.

When I started off watching this film I thought OK I'm just going to watch this film as my family just kept raving about it saying I need to see it as I am a big film watcher and I was expecting a real action packed fighting style film based off of the title being called 12 Angry Men but now this is in my Top 3 favourite films as it is just one of those films that is so addicting to watch with your family, especially grandparents as it was probably from their era as it was made in the 1950's.",10
28 December 2006,A classic--with a classic flaw,"The flaw in this classic was pointed out by a reviewer on 3 September 2005, when he pointed out that in the real world juries are not permitted to conduct their own experiments or consider evidence not presented in court.

At the same time, as another reviewer pointed out on 21 December 2006, had the jurors acted according to the correct legal procedure there would have been no basis for the plot and we thus would have missed an excellent movie.

Nevertheless, every time I see this film I can't help but think of the cases I've read of where jury verdicts were set aside because of this very sort of activity.

Suggestions that this film should be seen by every prospective juror are, I think, treading on shaky legal ground.

As entertainment--setting aside the weight of the film's overdone political correctness quotient--I agree with most comments: it is riveting. But I don't think it should be held up as an example for real juries.",7

19 January 2022,Nice film,"Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. Short - a film who must see !

17 October 2019,Conflict through dialogue,"While filmmaking is all about 'showing' through visuals rather than 'explaining in words'- this film stands out as an epic example of all that good dialogue can achieve. Within the confines of the premise of this film, it manages to accomplish the level of conflict that many visually-empowered films fail to achieve. As a screenwriter, this film is my go-to for inspiration.

18 October 2019,A Masterpiece,"It's no easy task to have a film that is as gripping and emotional as 12 Angry Men when nearly the entire movie is shot in a jury room with ""12 men"". Nevertheless, this film is both of these things and more, and its the movie's simplicity that makes it so beautiful. The stark contrasts between the jurors makes for tension that drives the story, yet the differences of the characters is what makes their eventual agreement so powerful. This movie concludes with an important message: we should all be prepared to change our minds. When putting your own experiences and biases to the side, things start to look much different. I know if I am ever called for jury duty, I will have this movie on my mind.

4 November 2019,Excellent Acting with Lessons to learn,"In the movie, 12 jurors were faced with a grave situation, which was to decide whether an 18-year-old should be found guilty of murder and given the death penalty. By watching their struggles in forming consensus, it shone light on the process of negotiations. The movie, primarily driven by the emotions of the jurors exhibit characteristics that impede the course of negotiations. Be it for dramatic effect, the jurors seem to have difficulties separating people from the problem on several occasions, with their emotions overwhelming them. The acting in 12 angry men is terrific, with the men portraying the true and loaded emotions that occur when there are disagreements. There are many lessons to be learnt from the negotiations process. For instance, Juror 10's underlying prejudice and preconceived notions can be observed when he said that slums were breeding grounds for criminals and were 'dirty'. Disapproval of his prejudiced views was clear as the other jurors turned their backs against him and disregarded his opinions, reminding him not to let it cloud his judgement. The movie is a true rleflection of what negotiations could be like in real-world scenarios, and it is important for us to take away some valuable skills from it",7
30 July 2002,One of the greatest pictures ever made,"Looking at the lists from over the years of the American Film Institute (best movies, comedies, thrillers, and passions), I've come to the conclusion that they know what they're talking about. However, they did make one mistake: the failure to recognize '12 angry men' as one of the best motion pictures ever made. Quite simply, '12 angry men' is perfect, or very close. It's the story of a court case, in which an 18-year old Hispanic kid is accused of killing his father. What's very interesting is that, with the exception of the first two minutes and the last 30 seconds, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors are discussing the case, and the bottom line is that every single solitary shred of evidence points to the direction that the kid is guilty. At the preliminary vote, eleven of the men vote guilty, and the twelfth man (played by Henry Fonda) votes not guilty. And then the fun starts. The film progresses with the eleven men convincing Henry Fonda that the boy is guilty (""they proved it a dozen different ways in court. Would you like me to list them for you?""), and meanwhile, Henry Fonda tries to convince them that there is enough reasonable doubt to consider that maybe the boy didn't commit the murder after all. There are several things that make this movie so good, and perhaps the most impressive is the fact that the acting performances are perfect; all twelve of them; a feat almost unthinkable in today's cinema. Each of the twelve men have a different personality, and you'll remember every one of them. The one that really stands out is Lee J. Cobb, because his character is very complex. He starts off polite and pleasant, and as the film progresses, starts to become 'excitable', as one of the characters calls it, and seems to suddenly be personally involved in the case. ""12 Angry Men"" is riveting, exciting, fascinating, and one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A must-see.",10
20 October 2019,It's not easy to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first.,"Simple, but amazing. An appropriate sentence for 12 Angry Men. A 1957 classic film that will never forget in memory. Indeed there is nothing more fun than watching a classic black and white film like this 12 Angry Man. 12 Angry Men, which was included in this low-budget film was truly extraordinary, even managed to receive 3 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Without us knowing, this film also seems to be a proof, that not all good films must be accompanied by a large budget.

25 October 2019,The Virtues and Shortcomings of Negotiation in the 12 Angry Men,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal.

14 September 2013,An all time classic,"This trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. This directorial masterpiece by Sydney Lumet is a must watch for all of you. Though the entire movie takes place in a single jury room (with a broken ceiling fan of course) but has got an intoxicating screenplay where several twists and turns awaits you.

There's a scene where it starts raining all of a sudden, a scene which brings a fantastic change to the story where you, as an audience, feel like taking a break from the hassle and enjoy rain.

Overall, this movie is a must watch and is highly recommended. I cannot discuss much about the story but trust me you won't regret watching it.

This is a pretty good summary of the movie, I loved it this movie had an amazing screenplay and very good acting by Henry Fonda. Sidney Lumet did a good job not making the movie to long but REGINALD ROSE, YES REGINALD ROSE, all you on the screenplay, it deserves to have this rating.

21 June 2006,'Simply' outstanding!,"12 Angry Men is one of the finest black and white films ever made. This movie just proves that how by brilliant writing and brilliant performances one can make a brilliant movie. Almost the whole movie is shot in a single room and thats where lies the command of the director over his craft. The performances of everyone is outstanding. Every person is shown to be a different character and has portrayed the same with at most sincerity. The other reason why this movie stands out i feel is that one is never bored or lost track of the plot even once during the whole movie in spite of most of it being shot in a single room. Also the manner in which the lone juror convinces others of his belief is different for different characters and is superbly brought out. For me this is the most amazing and simple movie i have ever seen!

1 July 2023,Compelling Mastery,"""12 Angry Men"" may not possess elements I would typically find thrilling or awe-inspiring, but it successfully gripped me, leaving me on the edge of my seat throughout the majority of the film. The sheer brilliance of its storytelling transformed twelve ordinary characters into individuals brimming with purpose and depth. Remarkably, the movie unfolds within just four distinct sets, yet it never loses its allure. This speaks volumes about the ability to elongate a narrative without diluting its essence or incorporating unnecessary plot twists. Even if you tend to steer clear of older films, I wholeheartedly encourage you to grant this one an opportunity.

27 May 2000,What a work!!,"I gather you've seen it...

It's hard to know what to say about it. The acting is beyond belief, and the dialog is completing engrossing.

A movie full of guys that gals should like, in that emotions and relationships and personalities are deeply explored. Every single character is portrayed in depth, yet there is also a vivid, engrossing plot.

All of the films I like most are ones that speak to human growth and human choice. I love this movie for its great characters and great dialog that exposes so much humanity.

I regret the final scene outside - I wish I could have come back to the real world with having left the 12 back in there. But now I am forced to see them also reenter the world. Why did the director give us that scene?",10

11 March 2020,A brilliant film that transcends time,"Less than five minutes into the jury discussion, and in one man's hand lies a one way ticket to death for the 18 year old accused against 11 juries. Each bringing their own backgrounds and prejudices, our protagonist fights to convince the rest of loopholes and possibilities in the case. Keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie, 12 Angry Men flawlessly displays the art of negotiation.

Published in 1957, I was initially skeptical about the insights I would get from this black and white movie in the context of 2020. Yet, I was surprised that not much seems to have changed in the face of passing time. This movie has transcended time and boundaries and made me question my privileges and rethink the prejudices I hold as a result of my upbringing and experiences. I am glad I was introduced to this movie, and would not mind watching it again.

23 January 2006,And you wonder why we hate seeing those Jury Duty letters!,"It's hot, cramped, tedious and can last for several hours before a resolution is achieved...

Now, take the life of a young man in your hands, 11 people ready to tear any of your ideas to shreds and you've become Juror #8 in Sidney Lumet's version of ""12 Angry Men"". To follow the seemingly apparent evidence and convict? Or question it, and unravel the many hidden layers concealing the possible truth? That is the conundrum thrust upon 12 ordinary men. Personifying our conscience and perhaps seeking an insurmountable solution to the case, Juror #8 sets forth excavating the grueling details presented. The prejudicial attitudes of the other jurors increase the complication of proving reasonable doubt, but eventually all but one succumb to logic. This in turn, creates a reversal of scenery as the wolf of the pack of 11 now stands in solitary, desperately clinging to his pride.

An insightful, mentally stimulating, look into the emotionally charged process of a jury's deliberation before a verdict is handed down. A variety of cast ensures the perfect mixture of arrogance and ridicule spread into the atmosphere creating tension from the get-go. Although some characters are one dimensional; foregoing human reasoning to sustain their own beliefs, the story still connects closely enough to correlate with the audience. It is as if a fountain of human emotion and beliefs was divided to reveal each trait in man and allow a presentation of each in regard to one topic. This produces, not so much a humanly conversation between equals, but a decisive battle amongst human characteristics. Overall, this creates a well designed and intricate plot with which to absorb the viewer. A commendable aspect of this film is that because of a wide coverage of emotion, almost everyone can find a character with whom they share a close relation or system of beliefs, thereby making it a unique and appealing conversion when a point of view is presented to that specific juror. This film also encourages abstract thought which is a concept I find appealing because it allows one to see outside the norms of society and comprise their own solutions based not only on what they've been told, but the logic behind it.",6

4 May 2020,great,"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.

27 December 2002,"Exquisite script, perfect acting","The old cliche ""they don't make 'em like that any more"" is an understatement for this fantastic film. What strikes me as unique is the fact that it takes place in real time in one room and that without being sensationalist, the script has the strength to keep the viewer captivated, hanging on every word of the actors. The acting is also executed with such power that one can see the characters develop within his/her own very eyes. It's such pure, unadulterated artistry, the kind of camera work and dialogue only real visionaries could bring to fruition. A must-see, one of the best films of all time for this cinefil.

Opinions and understanding, rationality and emotion, persistence and blind obedience, law and conscience, passion and calmness, bold assumptions and careful verification, etc., exchange and explore, it is a spark of collision, pointing to the hearts of the people.

10 March 2009,pure genius,"This film was fantastic! I was very sceptic when I sat down to watch this film: a black and white film, and 95% of it takes place in a room thats smaller then my bedroom. At first I thought it was just another overrated movie that isn't even half as good as the statistics show it. But thank god I was very wrong!I loved it!It makes you think. When a poor kid is on the verge of being sent to the chair, the jury wouldn't even go through the evidence again, they condemn the kid, but one of then opposes the others and gives the kid a chance.

This was one of the most tense movies I saw and the intellectual value is also enormous.It surpasses most of the great detective movies we saw and it doesn't even need fireworks and gunshots to do so!

Watch this movie!

15 March 2005,Great Movie,"Ostensibly, 12 Angry Men is a chamber piece about twelve motley jurors who are stuck with deciding the guilt or innocence of an eighteen-year-old kid who is charged with the murder of his father. It's actually more than just that, though. It's an examination into the unknowability of the truth, and a character film that cross-examines the lives of men from all walks of life.

When the film begins, the men take a preliminary vote. The results show that there are eleven men who think he is very obviously guilty, and only one man (Peter Fonda) who thinks that there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt. Of course, most of the other men think he's crazy for even suggesting innocence--half of them are already out the door and ready to send the boy to the chair.

""How do you know?"" Fonda is consistently asked.

His response is the same every time. ""I don't know anything, I'm just saying we should ask some questions, that's all."" The story unfolds magnificently and cleverly, a smorgasbord of personalities clashing and interacting with each other--all within the confines of a stiflingly hot sixteen by twenty-four foot jury room.

The performances in this film are amazing. Each juror comes across as a man who has his own reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of the alleged murderer, and the method with which each man ultimately decides are all unique to his person.

12 Angry Men comes across as a bit of a tribute to the American justice system as well. Careful not to claim perfection for it, director Sidney Lumet simply portrays it as the best system we have available.

""What if you convince us all and we set a murderer free?"" one of the jurors asks Fonda. Fonda doesn't answer.

A friend noted that she felt that the motivations for some of the juror's final conclusions came on a little strong, most notably in the case of the biggest advocate of the accused's guilt, who is played by Lee J. Cobb. Cobb seems to have some inner demons with his son, who he reveals he hasn't spoken to in years, and it's clear that at least several of the jurors begin to suspect Cobb's feelings aren't due to the facts but are the result of personal issues towards youth as a whole. I disagree with my friend. When critiquing a film, it's certainly important to gauge your feelings on the subtleties brought forth by it--in this particular scenario though, I feel that the complaint is a reach. I never found the scenarios that were brought forth by any of the characters was too heavy-handed or polemic. Quite the opposite--I viewed the story as the simple unfolding of a murder case that was to be decided by twelve very different individuals, each with his own background and story to contribute.

12 Angry Men is a straight-forward and fascinating story that is well-directed, well-acted, and makes a valuable point. I can easily add this to the list of my favorite films.",9
23 July 2020,Wonderful,"Less is more as it should be. empressive, ral time film. 12 men sitting in a room acting in a creative way and put a dramatic view over the film with their conversations. a really worthy film to be watched without regretting single minute. watching is a must.

27 September 2020,More questions than answers,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness.

29 May 2015,Simple. Genius. Immortal.,"This film provides audiences with a white knuckle thrill ride that they can't turn away from. But there are no car chases and punch ups, in fact the entire movie takes place in one room, and the narrative simply follows a discussion between 12 angry men. So how could it be so enthralling to watch?

Well, unsurprisingly, it's really the dialogue. The writing in this film is genius. Every time I watch this movie I am gripped by every word, even when I already know what is about to be said. It is some of the most provocative dialogue ever put to film. I literally get goosebumps at certain parts of this film because it is so intelligent and it gives you pleasure as a viewer that you can just relish in the brilliant and thought provoking debate that is being presented to you. The fact that the film seems like an adrenaline ride is a real testament to the screenplay that Reginald Rose created. As I said earlier this movie takes place in one room, the audience is given one environment and it never changes. The writing is so clever and so thought through that despite the never changing surroundings of the room the audiences never loses focus, never loses interest. It is simply delicious writing.

The performances are of course fantastic as well. Each of the 12 men have their own personalities and their own personal thoughts on the case at hand. Each actor really captures their character to the extent that the audience can start to put together a picture of what kind of man each of the men really is, despite the fact that we never even learn such basic information as their names. Henry Fonda however does stand out as being especially powerful as Juror #8. I'd like to just quickly say that Juror #8 is probably the most underrated movie hero of all time. Fonda brings a degree of charm to his role which makes him extremely likable for audiences and so you find yourself strongly rooting for him, just another element that takes the audience deeper into the world of the film.

Frankly this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is such a simple concept and because of that it was possible for all of the aspects of this film to be executed to very a high standard. This is one of those films that everyone has to watch at some point in their lives, and despite the fact that it was made in 1957 I promise it won't seem dated when you watch it if that's something you might be cautious of going into this movie. The fact that it was made such a long time ago shows it stands the test of time. Simple. Genius. Immortal.",10

Come on, sit down and Watch it because it's gonna be a life lesson. Every subject treated on this movie could be applied to any decade of the last 100 years. It's about conscience and humility, respect and justice. Such a incredible characters with a lot of differences between them, good argues and points of views. All the movie happens into a singular room, it's not too longer and dosn't have any waste.

15 September 2020,Simply Best,"Twelve Angry Men helps residents to remember their inborn obligations to genuinely comprehend each other all together for the American vote-based system to work adequately and reasonably. The film presents a jury of twelve men that must arrive at a consistent choice with respect to a first-degree murder preliminary of an 18-year-elderly person from the slums. Every attendant genuinely needs the decision to be authentic, notwithstanding, everybody sees equity distinctively as a result of their wants, interests, and backgrounds. All through the film, many juror's express partiality perspectives and need full thought to their obligation. One juror, who likewise experienced childhood in the slums, becomes cautious as a result of the current shame that any individual who was brought up in the slums is a thief or a killer. Another juror has passes to a ball game and needs to arrive at a choice before it starts. The film addresses whether individuals are really fit for choosing reality dispassionately. At the point when an individual is more put resources into their own needs, as opposed to the respectability of the framework in general, a legit and fair consultation is incomprehensible. Jack Warden, one of the jurors, needs to arrive at a decision quickly so as to go to a ball game. At first, he immovably concurs that the youngster is blameworthy however changes his vote when different jurors change theirs. Warden says, ""Help me out. Wake me up when this is finished. . . I'm somewhat tired of this as of now. We're wasting time quick. How about we split it up and return home. I'm changing my vote to not blameworthy."" His quick difference in supposition shows his absence of worry to think a really fair and precise choice. The film features the difficulties to majority rules system which requires noteworthy individuals to work. George Voskovec, another juror, typifies the American qualities that most residents trust is available in the legal framework. The main outsider in the gathering of attendants, Voskoevec appears to value the vote-based cycle exponentially more than the others. He reminds the hearers, ""We have a duty. This is a noteworthy thing about our vote-based system. . . We are advised via mail to come down to this place and choose the blame or blamelessness of a man we have not known previously. We don't have anything to pick up or lose by our decision."" Voskoevec's profound deference for American vote-based system makes him have huge confidence and hopefulness in the aims of his kindred jurors, which ends up being misinformed. In spite of his energy of the fair cycle, he starts to understand that a significant number of different members of the jury feel in an unexpected way. Members of the jury, for example, Jack Warden underestimate their opportunity and obligation, in any case, an outsider like Voskoevec comprehends the hindering impacts of a framework that does not have these qualities. His outrage is altogether advocated and fills in as an update that any vote-based cycle is basic. Notwithstanding want and energy bringing about emphatically one-sided thoughts, the juror Jack Klugman features the impact of past encounters when settling on this choice. Klugman turns out to be progressively protective when the thinking for the youngster being blame is that he was brought up in the slums. Being from the slums himself, he detests the conviction that anybody brought up in a slum is a killer or criminal.",10
19 April 2018,One of the best movie i ever watched...!!,"This is one of those movies that you should must watch before you die. as the title says the movie is about 12 men discussing about the teenager if he is guilty or not for killing his own father. in the first voting only one of them vote for 'NOT GUILTY' but as movie goes on he converted all the other 11's mind from Guilty to not Guilty. the movie keeps you on the edge of your chair, there is no any sci-fi thing or any action or any incredible scenes but still it entertains you. best thing about movie is the whole movie is created in a single room.each and every actor in movie are best. not for a single second movie makes you bored. obviously one of the best movie of all time....!!

1 August 2018,"Compelling and exciting movie, but legally illiterate","12 Angry men has for a long time been on my list of what I would consider the best movies ever made. When a movie that merely displays a couple of people sitting in a room talking to one another can have you on the edge of your seat, then it's surely doing something right. However, recently my opinion on the movie changed. Why, you may ask? Because it makes no sense legally. The film is about a jury that has to decide whether there is evidence of a murder beyond a reasonable doubt, which means exactly what it implies. There has to be a reasonable doubt for them not to convict the person, not absence of any doubt at all. Evidence is almost never 100% confirmatory, fingerprints or DNA don't say anyting definitive and witnesses can lie. But when there is a lot of evidence and all of it is pointing in one direction (as is the case in the movie), then the standard of reasonable doubt has surely been reached. This movie makes no legal sense and has been misinforming people on the way the law works for decades now. It's still great in it's acting and the excitement that it's able to bring to table, but whole premise doesn't make sense.",6

23 April 2002,Excellent. As close to perfect as possible.,"Since I first saw this movie when it came out on TV about 40 years ago, I have watched it numerous times. It is a movie that never becomes stale or dated. It was one of the few movies that I actually bought on VHS. Although I have seen only (or mainly) the B&W version, I think that color would detract from the starkness of the scene, the seriousness of the role these men play in the life of one young man. The ensemble play of these very differing characters is remarkable, and there are many moments that are unforgettable: E.G. Marshall taking off his glasses and massaging the bridge of his nose, thus unwittingly raising another point of doubt; Lee J.Cobb vehemently condemning young punks and at last breaking down over his own failure as a father; the old immigrant who brings a totally different perspective to justice. The slow character revelation is outstandingly written and directed and had the movie not had the blockbuster action picture ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" to contend with, it should have won numerous awards. Although there is virtually no real action in the movie, the tension is unrelenting as the jurors try to decide whether there is reasonable doubt. A film to savor again and again.

I have not seen it for a little over a year now. I did not see the TV movie version and would like to compare the two.",10

4 November 2020,Surprisingly brilliant film. A true classic.,"The movie 12 Angry Men is testimony to how good storytelling and acting is all you need to keep viewers' attention. I went in watching this movie with very low expectations, with it being a black and white film shot in a single location in its entirety. Throughout the entire film's duration, I was kept at the edge of my seat, constantly anticipating the next sequence of events and watching the charisma of Henry Foda's character. This is a movie that I would especially recommend for its good mix of entertainment value and educational value. This film perfectly demonstrates the power of good negotiation, a skill that doesn't come naturally to most of us. It does so in a way that isn't forced and instead inspires. A true masterpiece of a film!

5 November 2020,A deep-dive on negotiation,"A very simple setting to a really complex concept; negotiation. 12 Angry Men is about how 12 angry men, as the name suggests, fight against each other in a courtroom to reach a consensus. Many aspects of negotiation such as people's emotions, interests and thought processes are pit against each other, providing a deeper look into how people negotiate. The scale of the setting is further intensified in the face of a life and death situation. A really good watch!

10 January 2021,Top notch,"As a foreigner, I think the movie is so well crafted that you may fall prey to the delusion that all jurors are led by reason and are unaffected by biases of any sort. In actuality we know this is not the case in many an instance. But this compounds the net result of a movie well written, well shot, superbly recited and maybe a tad too fast in reaching its conclusion, a negligible con overall.

It's a simple film, but it has good, convincing acting, a good script and a great plot.

I thought it was fantastic.

30 April 2013,A Cinematic Thriller!!,"This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy. The jury decides the boy is not guilty after re-reviewing the case. Pretty inspiring! Christopher Nolan has done it again!!!!!! Fantastic Film, A+ moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so.

10 February 2006,The Story is Amazing,"I saw the 1997 TV version of this movie in 1998 and i was thrilled by the way the story is told in this movie. I saw this version a few years later and were more thrilled by this one, as it is so extremely realistic in its way. The clue sits with the actors and the director who can make such a movie out of only a few film sets. Yes the whole movie is filmed in a single room with 12 men in it, and the tension rises for every minute, and for every minute something twists and turns.

It's about 12 men who are about to vote for the chair on a man on trial. But one of them want to hear more about the case, can this man alone make all the others turn their statement from guilty to innocent ? This is one of the best movies ever made, and proves that the storyline is what make great movies. See this, and enjoy.

11 February 2021,Great,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
16 February 2021,90 minutes without stopping,"One of the best pictures I've seen recently. 90 minutes attention is completely riveted to the action taking place in just one room. Excellent acting. Everything is like in real life, people do not bother to work hard and delve into the details of the situation, there is black and white. They believe only in their eyes. And there is only one person among all, who does not even know, he just doubts. What will happen? What decision will be made seems to have no chance. This is a real movie. Each character is alive and with his own character, some believe only the facts, others just want to leave, and they do not care what impact they will have on the future fate of a teenager. Tension both in the room and outside the window. A summer shower tells us that the situation in the room is about to spiral out of control. And now the rain ends, the sun comes out people disperse each in their own direction, never to meet again. The very people who a few hours ago were the rulers of the boy's fate. Execute or pardon? Highly recommend.

3 May 2005,One of the finest works in film history,"Sometimes, unfortunately not very frequently, there are movies that are as close to perfection as possible. ""12 Angry Men"" is one of these. The basic idea is as simple as brilliant: director Sidney Lumet puts in his debut film 12 men together in one (resp. two rooms) and then during the whole film they stay in this place and discuss whether the accused boy is guilty or not, and in the same time they decide on his life. This last point is actually the critical aspect Lumet brings into this play-like movie. But no matter how simple the idea is, it is certainly not easy to realize it and to make out of this a good film. Lumet has made a fine work. It is just incredible and amazing how well he has managed to create such an intense and involving drama. One possible reason why he has succeeded so well is probably because he was supported by such an excellent cast, above all and of course, Henry Fonda, who gives here one of the best performances of his long career. But lets not forget the other actors like Martin Balsam or Jack Klugman. All in all this film is (and will always remain) one of the greatest directorial achievements in film history, with only one scene that somehow disturbs (but not very much): the very last sequence outside the building where Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) reveals his real name. In fact, he should just have been Number 8 and the whole action should only have taken place in these one or two rooms. Apart from this detail, ""12 Angry Men"" is a film you must have seen and it is even today very underrated.

Rating: 97

22 February 2021,Brilliant Masterpiece,"It is my first review for a film and now probably this movie was out like 60 years ago It is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. The room, the discussion, the thriller, the characters and the story are just exemplar. I am only just 23 years old and I have seen good amount of movie I will give this film an 11 out of 10 rating. I think the movie goes deep in our hearts and helps you realize many things: Prejudice,Selfish desires and most probably Ignorance that we know better than truth itself......and now I think more than ever in the 21st century we need to watch the movie and see without a great deal of discussion and through observation we are falling apart

7 February 2018,Incomparable.,"Probably the best screenplay there is, a gripping and an interesting film that captivates different human emotions and beliefs towards a certain case, the performances are great and by putting all those different characters in one place was brilliant each scene shows how each one is different and and by time you can feel how tense tense the characters are getting. with excellent direction by Lumet.

2 November 2008,Fantastic jury drama!,"Out of all the famous and over-rated oldies I've seen, this one takes the cake! It has a brilliant script and even better screenplay.

I was thoroughly entertained during the running time, the cast and characters were all fantastic, and the situation they were all placed in made this a great movie-watching experience in film-making.

22 September 2023,The Best Movie ever,"The best movie ever, The film is very enjoyable because of the excitement, suspense and dialogue The best of all is the idea of a film that discusses the facts around us And there is no absolute truth Although the film is simple in production and is not colorful, it is enjoyable from other aspects It is the type of film that, once you finish it, will make you look at the world around you in a completely different and new way.

At first glance, the film seems not even worth watching because it is old, not colorful, and at the beginning is not attractive, but after the first scenes pass and voting begins here, the excitement and enjoyment begin, so do not waste this extremely rare opportunity.

2 May 2023,Superb in every way - a true classic,"For most people there will be a handful of movies that they could watch and watch again and never tire of watching; this must be one of them. Everything about it is top notch - the acting, the directing, the cinematography. Its 'edge of seat stuff' without any CGI, explosions or fist fights (just about). For most of the time your confined in the same room as the jurors and yet you are never bored or distracted; your attention is totally focused on the events unfolding - you're in that room with them. This is an amazing piece of movie making. Did director Sidney Lumet do anything quite as good as this?

21 July 2021,One of the best directed movies ever made.,"This movie is a masterpiece. Definitely deserves all its recognition. It took a simple story of 12 jurors testifying their evidence to prove that a Puerto Rican teenager is guilty or not guilty for the murder of his father and turned it into a gripping, intelligent, and unforgettable masterwork of filmmaking. As the movie goes on, we can see the jurors' motivations, struggles, and hardships as well as the storytelling of the movie just by the performances and dialogue alone which draws you There is no music during the time where they try to solve the case except in the opening credits, when the jurors take a bathroom break, and when the movie ends, and even with all of that, you still get invested in the story and the characters. That's Sidney Lumet understanding the art of film right there. Sometimes, you don't need music or special effects to help the story, you can tell it by performances and visuals. If you are invested in the characters, then you have a good story and 12 Angry Men achieves that flawlessly.

The beauty of the movie is that it feels like an hour or 30 minutes short film when it's actually 1 hour and 36 minutes, but it never gets boring and uninteresting. When a movie feels a few times shorter than it's length, then it's a masterpiece. When I fast forward and backwards, it would say 40 minutes or an hour (I watched this on a Criterion Collection Blu-ray which shows the runtime when you fast forward or backwards) when it really felt like 20 or 10 minutes. That's insane, man. The most important thing about a movie in my view is pacing and 12 Angry Men is the most fast and relentlessly paced movie I've ever seen so it's also a masterclass of pacing.

It's a flawless work of art and I would recommend it to any film buff regardless if they like pre-70s movies or not. I would give the movie thumbs up as well as a A++.",10

19 May 2021,Probably deserves a 10 rating.,"This movie basically takes place in a single room. Without anything fancy. Pure acting. But not at all boring. It's full of thrill. The case is fully explained to the audience without even showing the trial or anything, just the juries arguments. The story of this movie is probably unlike any others. It deserves a 10 rating, it's just it lacks any visual effects, background score etc.

99% of the film is set in one dingy room.

The tension between the characters had you on the edge of your seat. It often felt like I was there in that jury room with the actors.

23 April 2004,12 Angry White Men,"It's hard to believe this movie is almost 50 years old...except that no women were on the jury. There was a minority juror, a foreign born citizen, a blue collar type, and several professionals, but no women which was really strange. (What? Like women could have been less logical or emotional than these men...most of them were idiots!) The characters were all something of a stereotype of themselves, but sometimes that is actually how juries are picked. Lawyers want a great diversity on a jury and I think that is why the court process works. The other problem I had with this movie was that unlike a Hollywood drama, where one guy is condemned by his fellow jurors for clogging up the quick trip home, in reality juries take their chore very seriously...at least that was my experience.

Those are not serious flaws with the movie, however. Jurors do get angry and emotional. It's stressful. Everyone is acutely aware that someone's life is depending on your being open minded and paying attention. A lot of folks on the IMDB kept writing that the kid in this movie was obviously guilty or obviously not guilty, but you have to remember that the judge is not asking you to decide if the person is innocent or guilty. You are asked if you can decide that beyond a reasonable doubt. So it's never so easy as take a quick vote and go home. You look at all the evidence and try to use logic to make your decision but in reality it is still a gut level decision. It's not crystal clear...especially when the lawyers present the jurors with so called expert trial witnesses. These people get paid to mess with jurors minds. At any rate, during the trial I was on, the jurors were on their toes enough to know when they had been snowed by expert witnesses.

The synopsis of this movie has been discussed in great length, so I will just add a few personal comments. The script is exceedingly well written, directed and performed. The dialogue was magnificent. It felt like you were watching the deliberation in real time from the way it was filmed. Riveting cinematography. Few movies can carry an audience for that long with just one room and a few characters. My Dinner With Andre' comes to mind.

The Lee J. Cobb character was so emotional and so over the top...he was difficult for me to swallow, a little too Freudian for a modern audience, but that is forgiven given this movie's age. The Henry Fonda character is the one all defense attorneys want on the jury. The supporting actors were all fine to watch.

My favorite lines was: ""Pardon. But...Oh, pardon, pardon.' `What are you being so polite all the time for?"" ""For the same reason you're not. I was brought up that way.""

4 June 2002,watched this gem in school,"What a gem of a film. Never would have thought to rent this in a million years... luckily my law class teachers thought it would provide a viable look into jury duty and what it really means. The dialog, though a bit stodgy old-manish at times, really provides insights into the socio-political background of the era. Unfortunately, it's only a movie, and what happened in the jury room, with one man really standing up for what he believes is rarely documented anywhere in the real world. We need some more juror #8's in this life, or the juror #8's need more recognition. Cheers.

24 September 2021,A timeless classic,"I grew up watching movies with green screens, special effects and 100 million dollar budgets. So I was skeptical when I saw the positive reviews of a fully black and white film made in 1957. After watching this movie I realized, I couldn't have been more wrong.

12 Angry Men is about a jury which has to determine if a child is guilty. The movie has no action, no romance, no comedy yet I was captivated the whole time. Every member of the jury is an actual human being, with their own problems and interests. Even after 60 years, the characters are very relatable and you feel as if you are a part of the jury. I can recommend this movie to anyone at anytime.

27 September 2021,Superb film,"Great story, great script and the acting is utterly convincing. I don't think anyone could stop watching this before the end. It occurred to me that it would lose something in colour - its an all male cast, dressed in the uniform of the office suit, and black white and grey help convey the plot, don't distract, and add to the claustrophobia. The Director and the DOP are past masters - loved the shots through the coat cupboard. I don't pretend to be a movie buff but if anyone does, and hasn't seen this, he or she is missing a trick. Highest form of film-making, I don't thing this has been bettered, though it is more than 60 years.

28 October 2017,Psycho thriller,"One of the most favorite old movies. Psychological thriller that confuses you to the extreme because you do not know whom to trust, who to love, hate, condemn. A rich description of human nature on the screen, a psychology guide. For me, the greatest experience in this movie was to see how different types of characters influence one another, while the real action (to judge) becomes secondary,

6 November 2021,a great movie about reasoning,"The movie is one o my favorite. It is as intense as it is reasonable.it shows how the justice must be completely perfect and without doubt. A judge or jury must contemplate every possibility of person on trial not being guilty and serve the justice that must be completely without any doubt.

14 June 2020,A very wonderful movie.,"Man is a liar; man is a liar who will deceive himself. For indifference, for prejudice, for numbness, for ridiculous self-esteem, or even for no reason to insist on a lie. A society without reason is often also a society without feelings. Highly recommended, brilliant.

23 November 2020,12 white guys wearing white shirts and ties,"A dated film, with no diversity in the make-up of this jury. In today's courts, I doubt half of these guys would get pass the 1st interview by lawyers of both sides. Henry Fonda's twisting of the facts influence the other 11 jurors to change their minds. I find this hard to believe. A hung jury, I could buy. Every time I see this film, I ask, then who did kill the father ?

21 February 2009,A Masterpiece ( spoilers),"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9

25 August 2013,quite remarkable movie,"The most amazing point to me is that the whole story happens in just one room between 12 people arguing and some times fighting about the fate of a 18 yo boy accused of killing his father by stabbing in his chest down and in and you are never lost or bored and willingly looking to see what happens next.

It is narrating how people may judge based on prejudice and mix important even social decisions with their personal issues. The movie has a good lesson that based on logical talk and discussion you can fix lots of problems and stop biased people to corrupt everything even a boy's life. I really liked the movie.

3 April 2015,A single room movie,"12 Angry men is a single room movie. Just a focused dialogue movie in which someone of these 12 angry men try to convince the other 11 with his opinion in a crime.

The best thing about this movie that it talks only to your mind, you won't see impressive visual effects, you won't listen to an amazing soundtrack, you won't have any action scene. Just a discussion for 90 minutes to be excited till the last second in the movie.

This movie has the absolute meaning of critical thinking, and how critical thinking can change many axiomatic issues which we don't give them the enough thinking and then judge on them the wrong judgement.

Henry Fonda was wonderful in his way which he tries to convince the others and refuses to follow his intuition and just went to the critical thinking in somebodies life or death matter",9

2 December 2021,Culturally relevant film,"12 Angry Men is a cleverly written, culturally relevant film that tackles societal issues in a simple and concise way through the tale of 12 jurors deliberating on a verdict. Predominantly shot in a single room and exquisitely acted throughout, Director Sidney Lumet does an excellent job encapsulating the mood and attitude of every day people whilst simultaneously proving you don't need a big budget and special effects to make an exciting film.

28 June 2005,Impresssive Direction,"Some of the most impressive direction I have ever seen. This movie is set in one room, and Lumet can make that room feel very large and very small depending on the different situation. The most amazing aspect of this movie for me was the framing. The most wonderfully beautiful images are on screen during this movie. For me, the issues for this movie come from the script. Some of the dialog isn't too great or well delivered. The acting is only OK. I really look for acting in these older movies because I sometimes feel that it holds movies back. The acting in 12 Angry Men does not hold the movie back, but it could be better. On a whole, this is a wonderfully artistic and moving movie. It covers many interesting topics about life and death, and Mr. Lumet is on the top of his game.

1 October 2008,great movie with great special effects,"First of all i want to say that i absolutely fell in love with this flick. it is a very high budget very long and very entertaining action movie. the shooting just doesn't stop no matter what you do. the special effects are absolutely breathtaking, way ahead of their time if you ask me, CGI and very advanced animation technology makes this movie worth a look. I was a bit disappointed by fonda's performance in his role as the big hero, and found his acting rather stoned. Was he supposed to resemble a retard or a tree, i don't know. Anyway, this is the film that lead to the production of Rambo first blood, commando, snake eater series, nemesis, hercules in new york and dozens of great romantic Oscar winning pellicles. Have you not seen this movie, i feel sorry for you AND highly recommend that you leave it on the shelf. don't waste your time with this,try lorenzo lamas's movies. They are much better and do not match the exceptionally wonderful cosmology of this film. Hope this helped you out! cheers!

19 January 2022,"In fact, the picture is a unique detective story","12 people gathered in the room. They are jurors in a court session during which a criminal case is being considered on the most serious crime - premeditated murder. They were obliged to make a verdict: a unanimous decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The fate of man is in their hands. How will they dispose of this right?

In fact, the picture is a unique detective story, in which there is no banal question ""Who killed?"" the only question is ""Guilty or innocent"". It does not matter who committed the crime, it is important whether there are grounds for reasonable doubt among those who pass sentence.

It is worth noting that the film is not filled with any hidden meanings, complex metaphors or pompous allegories, it is a simple story about human indifference. And as you know, genius is in simplicity.

16 December 2017,One of interesting movies with action in one place,"I usually love movies having action place and why? --> They have just much better scenario than fantastic/action movies. As in one place there are no special effects, there are no esplosions/fires/killing hundreds of people one by one in a minute --> there is just showing important aspect of life, mental fight, something which can enchance spectators life, make it richer. 12 Angry Men is definitely such movie - a classical must on the list.

31 January 2006,Wonderful thought provoking story,"When I was in junior high school I found this story in the back of one of the unused books in English. I can remember being so enthralled with the story that I read it all through class and then took it home to finish. Seeing a true to the story film version is wonderful. Didn't they really know what acting was about back then? When the acting had to stand out because that was what you came to see. Man I love the golden age of film. If you liked this then check out DOA that's another wonderful flick with a good message. I think that 12 Angry Men really showcases what being on a jury can be like. It generates feelings for these men and their story and it really does say a lot about the justice system.

21 March 2014,Cinematographic masterpiece,"I was really impressed by this movie. At first i thought it;s impossible to make a movie with just a dozen men in a room but i was mesmerized. It's true, it has a predictable plot, but i just couldn't take my eyes off the screen because i just couldn't tell what will be the next clue that they will discuss. Very good portreyals of human character. Very nice presentation by how the past can affect the human character and how you can solve problems with qualities not with flaws. And the movie distribution is fantastic, so many great actors put together. Fantastic movie !A masterful work of debate and dialogue; of shifting momentum and the ideal of sticking to your scruples in the face of antagonistic groupthink.

22 June 2000,My all-time favorite,"This is, in fact, my all-time favorite film. You can teach an entire course in film making from this one production. The camera is used as a thirteenth, silent juror. When the old bigoted juror goes on his tirade all the other jurors turn and or leave the table, including the camera. Henry Fonda gives his finest performance here when he must timidly vote against conviction then lead the group through strength of character to set aside their presumption of guilt and grant the defendant a shadow of a doubt. It's as gripping a drama as I've seen. You will not be disappointed.

2 March 2004,Simple but effective,"This classic film will need no introduction to most film fans but somehow it had managed to pass me by. I was aware of its reputation and so was expecting something very special. I was slightly disappointed, but not excessively so. The acting is sublime, but pointed. The camerawork is perfect, getting progressively closer to individuals as the story unfolds. The script is paced to perfection. The plot is convincing. However, it's all a little too contrived; obviously this has to be the case. The film can only support one scene for so long, and we have to reach the opposite conclusion within that time. Still, you have to wonder exactly how poor the defence attorney must have been to miss all these important doubts on the prosecution case. Maybe that's the point - all over the democratic world, people are getting screwed over by disinterested attorneys because there is no juror #8 in every jury. I prefer to think that this is, of course, symbolic, or even didactic. A reminder to everyone of the meaning of 'reasonable doubt' and 'guilty', and a lesson in how juries should reach verdicts. In this respect it's very important. And to remain gripping and entertaining to the end is a testament to the justified acclaim Lumet's magnus opus receives.",9
19 June 2002,"The reason this movie is called ""12 Angry Men""","I rented and watched this excellent film about 5 hours ago.

If you didn't like this movie, then you must be one of the twelve angry men(or women) who did not enjoy this film for some reason :) Hence 12 angry men...

25 May 2023,Born in 1981,"As of this review it's 2023 and I'm 41 years old, and this is the oldest film I've reviewed. I don't know if I'd ever seen Henry Fonda in anything before this one and now I see why he was so famous. While I felt this could have gone on longer, I knew what was going to happen. While some of it seems forced and far fetched, the premise is really good. You have 12 men of all different social standings, and a decent variety of ages. I guess they didn't allow women on juries back then, or anything other than white males? The acting in this film is downright heroic is what it is. I was in awe of how good these guys were, not just Fonda but all of them really.

You won't be disappointing by the fact this one is in black and white and takes place in one room. Right from the start of this one it had me captivated and it's easy to see why this is considered such a classic. It stands the test of time, and I applauded all the actors in this one. Great for people of all ages, and a great lesson in this one too.

30 September 2001,"Wonderful screenplay, great acting.","Talk about a simple film! 12 guys as jurors are in one room for all but maybe 3 minutes of the film. In 90+ minutes, they talk through the details of the murder case, some aforementioned in the courtroom and some underlooked, to either determine a verdict - which must be unanimous or else the trial is ""hung.""

The fact of a unanimous vote being required makes the foundation for a very gripping film. However, with no visual flashbacks or anything, if one is going to be successful for a film with such a monotonous setting, some guidelines are required. 1. The running time must not be overlong. At some point, we'd feel as frustrated as some of the jurors. 2. The screenplay must be first-rate. and 3. The acting must be believable.

This film passes all three criteria with flying colors. The running time is barely over 90 minutes, ample time to throughly develop every idea. The script was great! The details of the case are thought out wonderfully. And the character development: It's amazing what you learn about all 12 men, without learning their names! While I won't reveal the outcome, I will say that the way the momentum swings is almost like watching a football game or something. The final point about the screenplay (as well as the acting) is that it's all very believable. It sounds like a conversation I might expect to encounter in 1957 in a jury room. Even in 2001, however, the substance of the movie is still valid. The situation in real-life still occurs.

One final thing about the acting. While all 12 men did great performances, I am continually amazed by Henry Fonda. He is one of the few men of his time I have seen fit each role he plays to a tee.. without ever overacting.

In summary, this is a movie that very deserving of the praise it receives.",10
28 December 2022,My favorite movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story.

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind.

31 March 2023,One of the best ever!,"This is a remarkable film. I remember watching it in a civics and economics course in high school. Loved it then and love it now. This movie takes place in 1 room with 12 actors discussing a murder case, so it has every opportunity to fail as the film lives and dies on its performances and it hits on every mark. It creates tension and all types of different emotions throughout the film. All the actors are at their best and Henry Fonda as juror #8, should be considered one of films greatest heroes. It is truly deserving of its top 10 spot on IMDB top 250 films of all time. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing this movie, then do yourself a favor and see it!!

14 March 2023,is impossible to forget!,"One of the best talk films, indeed the best.. gives life lessons. The dialogues are great and the acting is beyond imagination, you will forget in many moments that you are watching a movie, as if the actors are being portrayed with their real characters! The direction is very good and the angles of photography are amazing. The film is considered the best way to use the one-location method of filming and employ it in the best way possible. We have seen anger, indifference, prejudice, ignorance, racism, and we have seen good qualities such as mercy, respect, acceptance of mistakes, and forgiveness. Greatness!

25 March 2003,true cinema classic,"Even though this film was made in 1957, the issues it raises are still relevant to us today. Racism is still a widespread problem in North American society, especially in our judicial system. Often people's judgments are affected by cultural and racial factors, whether consciously or subconsciously, and this movie captures this aspect of human nature perfectly. The acting was very good, with Henry Fonda and Lee Cobb having the stand out performances. They pull off their roles as the two polar opposites very well, and the other 10 characters fit in-between them on the personality spectrum. As the movie progresses the tension increases, and the characters struggle with their own convictions. The jury room seems to close in on them as they all take their turns debating and stating their opinions. Even though there is no action, and the plot is pushed forward solely by dialogue, the movie still totally engrosses you as a viewer, which establishes it as a true cinema classic. 9/10

4 July 2011,Incredibly Gripping,"When the premise is that twelve men are presiding over a murder case during jury duty, anyone who has ever been required to attend jury themselves will agree that, this sounds like one hell of a boring plot. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men has become an incredibly popular film over the years and for good reason. The plot is deceptively simple; twelve men in a jury engage in heated discussion with each other, over the innocence of a young man accused of murder. It appears to be a very open-and-shut case, yet the calm, enquiring and objective Henry Fonda's questionings cause the entire jury to turn on their head's as more and more perceptions start to come to light.

The situation this jury finds itself in is in itself, incredibly gripping. We, the audience, look in on people who seem as though their opinions on the matter are firmly set in stone. Characters who at first are so certain about the ultimate outcome, they'd rather joke, talk about sports, boast about their business, banter or play crossword puzzles, rather than take the matter at hand seriously. Watching Henry Fonda manage to convincingly break down each and every one of their uncaring barriers is something highly engaging as he seems to be breaking down your barrier as well. Something about the way in which the story is portrayed almost makes you yourself feel like one of the characters in the jury; the film is shot in real-time, the characters opinions change with each monologue, the room you are in while watching the film almost becomes just as hot, stuffy and restless as the room in which these jurors preside in.

Speaking of the jurors, another amazing thing about this film is what amazing characters they are. The twelve we are presented with are all unique and all of them have differing reactions to the situation they are in, the situation to be discussed and to each other and this is one of the most fascinating aspects about the film as a whole. First, there's Henry Fonda's protagonist, a man who despite being comparatively timid in contrast to the other characters at first, manages to show an admirable amount of unflinching will and integrity, without seeming to become annoyingly sanctimonious. Then there's Lee J. Cobb's excellent performance as our antagonist, Juror #3; a man who from the offset is more personally involved with this trial than he will willingly let on. My personal favourite character is the analytical stockbroker Juror #4 played by E.G. Marshall, as of all the characters in the room willing to vote guilty, he seemed to me as the most logical yet still open to reason.

Of course, although the film is very good, it isn't perfect. It is however, good enough to the point where I can only really make 'nitpicks' rather than criticisms. One such nitpick is the use of close- up shots during the film, particularly the one's involving the old man, Juror #9, which I felt looked quite out of place. The film seemed to flow in a very much naturalistic way, for the close-up shots to be in any way effective. I did also think that while some of the evidence discussed in the juror's room on the young man's behalf, was very convincing, some of it did really seem as though they were grasping at straws; the talk about the knife in particular I found quite circumstantial. Maybe more information at the very start of the film, about the case at hand would have been helpful as well. Like I mentioned earlier however, these are minor nitpicks.

12 Angry Men is an extremely interesting film; you have an interesting situation, a load of interesting characters and all of this is excellently executed. Considering the setting as well, these 96 minutes seem to fly-by as you never once find yourself bored. A very well justified, timeless classic.",9
17 March 2005,One of a kind,"I echo every comment I've read up to now on why this is such a great film. Here's mine.

Classic films need to have everything going for them: superior acting, compelling story, amazing direction. Notice I left out special effects or genre-specific idiosyncrasies like dramatic chase sequences in action films or singing and dancing in musicals. Depending on the type of film, these elements are definitely needed, of course, but what propels any film into classic status is the absolute necessity of the basics I first mentioned. Any deficiency in one category automatically downgrades my rating to just a very good movie, no matter how big the explosions or realistic the gore (I love horror movies, too).

As any film buff knows, most movies are adequate to downright terrible. However, even the bad ones can be entertaining in a fast food, disposable kind of way (we all have our guilty pleasures, and I know my list is rather long...lol). It's when we come across a movie that fires on all cylinders that truly inspires joy, and reveals why great film-making moves us.

12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies for me. It's almost disarmingly simple and straightforward. It's drama frighteningly intense. I understand why some may view the film as dated, or have a problem with the era from which it was made. I take into account all the cultural differences between then and now (the all-white male jury, the American slang, the one-dimensional setting) but none of it matters because the story, direction, and acting are so good. The morality of the story is the focus, not the backdrop.

I don't see this movie being irrelevant 100 years from now. In fact, if present social trends continue, it may be even more important, considering how we seem to be careening to a less moral, instant gratification society where personal responsibility is secondary to selfish needs. Movies like this may become a beacon for thoughtfulness and sanity. But I digress; apologies for soap boxing.

As much as I hate lists, I would easily place this movie in my Top Ten of All-Time.",10
3 January 2005,One of the most Important films ever made,"I first saw this film about 16 years ago. I had recently seen an episode from ""Hancock's Half Hour"" entitled 12 Angry Men which involved Tony Hancock trying to convince a Jury that Sid James was innocent. The episode was excellent and then after looking in the paper I noticed that this film was to be shown. I thought it only right to see the inspiration behind the aforementioned episode. I must have been 15 at the time but from the moment Martin Balsam first asks the members of the Jury to raise their hands I was hooked. The highly talented cast give superb performances that are enhanced by the excellent camera work, brilliant script and thought provoking subject matter. I recently saw the remake starring Jack Lemmon and thought it to have some great twists on the original. Particularly on Ed Begley's character from the original film. All in all though, what makes the original is the intimacy the camera has on each member of the jury, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie and the tension between the characters. Sidney Lumet has created a masterpiece here and thoroughly deserves to be in the top 100 movies of all time.",10
6 October 2019,Every day story!,"I think that every one of us one day needed a support from family, friend or even a stranger just to say you are right you are good enough, the movie tell a story happening every day for you for me, its a story of how to see the good inside you and don't judge according your thoughts its how to turn your goodness lights on

26 December 2015,The excellence of cinema,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
13 September 2013,Outstanding movie,"The film is about jury consisting of 12 people which met for a murder trial. The film starts with just one person who has reasonable doubt that the accused is not guilty. As the film passes he tries to convince others that he may not be guilty. The way the movie is directed is simply outstanding. The movie proceeds with just dialogues. I have never seen any other movie in which a plot has been executed so amazingly. The movie puts most of the modern films to shame. Without much visual effects and technology the plain storytelling style guarantees that any viewer would be enthralled watching it. This is a must watch movie.

10 June 2014,Flawless,"In the purest sense, this movie represents the art of representation. With only twelve men and a room, the director brings to the spectator the struggle of a fair judgment.

Without any action in terms of what we are familiar to see nowadays, it's brilliant that a movie like this maintains the spectator always curious and looking forward to see what will be decided in the end. Also, it's notable the criticism during all discussions between characters to choose the destiny of a man's life.

This is a masterpiece and a must-see. If you want a movie with content this is the one. The script was very well written and the subject is timeless.

7 May 2023,Very tense and Thought Provoking Movie,"12 Angry Men is a tense and thought-provoking movie that focuses on a jury's decision on a murder trial. The film explores themes of prejudice, the flaws human of judgement, and justice.

The story takes place in a jury room, where 12 jurors meet to decide whether a man accused of murdering his father should be sentenced to death. The prosecution's case initially seems solid, and the jurors vote 11-1 in favor of the young man being guilty. However, one juror does not agree, arguing that the evidence should be discussed further. As the jurors takes a look again at the details of the case, they see that there are more holes than they realize.

The movie was brilliant. Every line of dialogue revealed more about the case and more about each juror's preconceived notions about the case and their own personal bias. Each character is confronted and receives character development that leads to them changing their decision.

The film's exploration of prejudice, human fallibility, and the pursuit of justice challenges viewers to confront their own biases. Overall, this film stands the test of time, with its themes that are still relevant to this day.",10

29 March 2021,Great Shots,"Here is another classic film that was amazingly shot with limitations. The film took place in one room and the camera choreography is simply beautiful adding intensity to the film and creating those emotional close up shots that we all love. Too bad that we've pulled away from filming this way. I wish this style will come back soon to our films instead of constantly chopping shots/scenes and cheating on acting. Excellent study film for directors and cinematographers.

8 May 2009,Highly Recommended,"I wouldn't write anything which confuses you, just Plain and simple.

I never thought the movie would be so good.The movie is one of the best you would ever see. Set completely in a single room, the characters are vivid. The acting has been brilliant and the story captures you from the very first to the very last shot. The dialogues are superb and comic.

The twelve characters represent almost every aspect of human life plus the various strata of society. The direction is phenomenal and away ahead of it's time.

Highly Recommended.

19 January 2023,"Sidney Lumet's classic courtroom drama has aged perfectly, and is as compelling today as it ever was.","I don't believe there is anything new that can be said about this film, as it was released 65 years ago. Regardless of what I say, I am unable to add or take away from its legacy. I'm confident this particular review will hold little value in the realm of film criticism, but I felt compelled to write it anyway because ""12 Angry Men"" is just that remarkable. The genius of movies like this simply cannot be exaggerated, so adding praise onto the mountains of admiration it has already received will do no harm.

My first interaction with this film was during the eighth grade, and that is regrettably the only encounter I've had with it until this week. What a masterpiece I've been missing out on! This was Sidney Lumet's first feature film, but one could be forgiven for thinking it was his hundredth because of his masterful direction. Almost the entirety of the picture takes place in one room, but boredom never once threatens to creep in.

At the start of the film we learn that a young man, only 18 years of age, is accused of murdering his father with a knife. The jury has heard all the evidence and are instructed to deliberate amongst themselves in order to come to a unanimous decision on whether or not the young man is guilty. If he is found guilty, he'll be put to death. Shortly after entering the jury room, the jurors take a vote to find which way everyone is leaning. Eleven of them believe the defendant to be guilty. Only one man, Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda), believes there is reasonable doubt that would suggest he had not murdered his father. The other men react with confusion, frustration, rage, and annoyance. Juror No. 8 stands firm in his decision, and the 12 men are forced to discuss the matter intensely.

I won't say any more about the plot, though it is unlikely that anyone reading this hasn't already seen the film - many times, no doubt. What I can say is that ""12 Angry Men"" has an incredible script. Each character has a clearly defined personality and set of morals that influences their thought processes. Every man's unique perspective comes into play as the discussions and disagreements progress. The dialogue is incredibly compelling, and during the tense exchanges there is no music to be heard, because the emotional intensity is exactly where it needs to be without any assistance. Perhaps the screenplay's greatest strength is that it unravels more information for us as the minutes go by. We learn details about the case as the jurors recall examples of testimony and make speculations based on unclear information. Nothing else can be said except that it's a brilliant script.

What stands out more than anything else in this picture is the incredible cast. Every single character is phenomenally portrayed; there isn't a weak link in the entire group. Henry Fonda is the most charismatic of the bunch, but that's not to say he overshadows anyone else. John Fielder plays a meek, yet passionate Juror No. 2, and Lee J. Cobb's Juror No. 3 is bold and confrontational. Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber all hold their own when their numbers are called. E. G. Marshall's reasoning Juror No. 4 has an exceptionally powerful moment at a pivotal point in the film, which he knocks out of the park. Finally, Jack Warden does a solid job of portraying Juror No. 7, a sarcastic and impatient man. Lumet skillfully draws out top-tier performances from every individual on screen, and the setup of each scene is tremendously well executed. The blocking of the actors is always perfect, and the camera movements are subtle, yet impactful. Director of photography Boris Kaufman's lighting and lensing is superb; when combined with Carl Lerner's dexterous editing we almost don't need any dialogue to tell what's happening at any given moment. It's a magnificently crafted film from start to finish.

The list of movies that have matched the quality of ""12 Angry Men"" is extremely short, and that's likely to remain true for the rest of time. To say that Lumet's feature debut is a masterclass in filmmaking would be an understatement. It's a decidedly rare piece of cinema that has earned every acclaim that's been bestowed upon it.",9
16 November 2017,Great,"Don't make them like this anymore. A compelling story and ""real"" actors is all you need. Fonda at his best. Jack Klugman in a rare but great dramatic role. Film and people, nothing else. No CGI, effects. Don't be afraid of old movies. They aren't old if you've never seen them. True vision of human nature and our lack of realizing right and wrong due to a lazy society.

22 August 2009,Excellent Film for ages,"It was before 2 years i saw this film. And still it tops my list. This was my first Sidney Lumet film. How i could describe this film? It is really out of words to describe this masterpiece. Great screenplay along with excellent dialogs. The acting of ensemble cast is absolutely fantastic. It is rarely that we are exposed to such group of talented actors in Cinema. And when they unite in this film, we are getting 1 and half hour of excellent drama. It is sad that more than 2000 people voted - vely for this film. Initially i was reluctant to watch this film due to the facts that this film was shot in the 1950s and is black and white. But guys don't hesitate to such facts. This film is gonna persist for ages.

28 April 2009,"A brainy, thought-provoking movie without any action, romance.","It's a rarity to find such a film without any action, romance, comedy etc. and especially no commercial elements. Well, you can see that it's made in 1957 and maybe that's the reason...?!!

The movie starts with a scene in the court(as usual in some movies) where the accused has been proved guilty and given a death sentence for committing a murder. Here comes the actual part of the film, where the scene now shifts to the jury room, where twelve men take part in a discussion. The beginning 20 minutes gives the details of jury member, how they're here. It's not so surprising that one decides the life of a boy/man by deciding him guilty or not guilty in order to get to a baseball game!!!

As usual, you find an exceptional guy who keeps mum throughout the introduction of the movie(and steals the show for the rest of the part of the movie!!!). He's the only guy who said he thinks the boy was not guilty since there's a little doubt in the murder. And there it starts, the whole discussion takes place with a few breaks and at the end of vote count there seems to be increasing support for the boy being not guilty. However, there's a twist almost at the end of the film, where juror 3 and 4 tear apart the theories of the boy being not guilty. It's not the actual hero who proves the accused is not guilty, but watch for yourself.

Another one whose performance is to be mentioned is the role of Lee.J.Cobb who's also the executioner and shows up the emotional stress at the end, exceptional performance of the father!!! Finally, I give the movie thumbs up if you're not a fan of action genres, but you enjoy a thrilling ride not through adventure but dialogs that's been crisp and provide a superb stroke of intelligence.",10
26 September 2012,"A feast to watch, even the second time around !","Oh my my !! What a feast to watch ! I watched this movie for the second time today. I generally don't prefer to watch a movie second time as I prefer to watch something new instead of something I have already seen. But today, somehow, I didn't have any new movie available to watch and I thought of going through my library of close to 1000 movies just to have a glimpse of what all I have got. I desperately wanted to watch a movie since I was getting bored and I picked my ""12 angry Men"" from my library. I was casual in the beginning since I had already watched it before, but oh boy, I was so much captivated while watching this movie second time too. The story and the characters are so likable.

Kudos to Henry Fonda and the team to come up with such a masterpiece. I wish more meaningful movies with as low a budget as this one could be made in today's time too. 10 out of 10 for this movie !!

19 March 2010,Brilliant,"A movie has been made that doesn't need flashy graphics, weird story lines, unbelievable characters or directors and actors wanting their cut. This is it.

Henry Fonda made this movie, because he believed in the story. It was not successful when released, But look at it now.

People with courage and conviction do not exist in movies anymore, if they do it is with guns a-blazing. Which juror are you? Are you nice or are you nasty. The characters do make you look into your soul. I admit the production values are not what a younger person would expect, however what is inside this great production is worth it This is the movie everybody should watch, Even just to see which juror you would be.

19 May 2010,don't pass the verdict unless you are sure about all the facts.,"An Outstanding movie. Every single character have done exceedingly well. What i have liked most about this movie, is that, it gives a message to everyone---don't pass the verdict unless you are sure about all the facts.

Juror #8 Henry Fonda made a point first, then Juror around him started to make points. Among them some are afraid to to accept the truth, even when Henry Fonda proved that the old man who testified in the court was wrong.

The movie became most interesting when the voting result was 9-3 to not guilty. One of the juror made a point that he believes the boy is guilty because an woman testified it in the court and even Henry Fonda could not explain it, then the old juror and the most experienced one notice the rubbing around the nose of the juror. And that eventually solved the problem.

It showed to us how a small little facts can change the whole thing. The movie is so amazing that you can not distract for one moment.",10

4 May 2023,loved it then....even better now!,"First watched this in my teens ( born 2 years after it was made) with my father who persuaded me of its importance; he was so right then but even more salutary now. The decades have enhanced the personal resonance, now identifying the vital character types depicted by the ""angry 12"" and being able to connect their attitudes, behaviours and values to people I know and have known. We are all present in this exceptional drama that explores what is critical about the human condition and how society influences therein. Democracy underpins the principles being considered and poignantly played out as the jury shifts towards its outcome. The black and white brings a starkness today that helps expose and focus the core messages. The acting is good and deftly presented with simple, effective camera work bringing the claustrophobic atmosphere( smoke haze nostalgia) The emotional impact is subtle but no less emphatic....more so with me watching this in my late 60's....as the prejudices betrayed by each person are just, if not more, as prescient today. Although all male and white the narrative can be readily transferred into today's societal issues; the white me are symbolic....the story stands the test of time...and maybe thats the real shame here!!",10

31 July 2000,A look at justice,"This movie is a masterful look into the workings of trial by jury. At the movie's opening all of the jurors are ready to send the defendant to the chair...except one (Fonda). He takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that there is reasonable doubt that he committed the crime and thus potentially save an innocent man's life. Having never served on a jury, this movie made me think about how an innocent person can be saved by thoroughly examining all of the facts, rather then jumping to false conclusions. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it may boost your faith in the justice system and your fellow man.

13 June 2016,Superb,"It was remade in Hindi. ""Ek ruka hua faisla"". It is one of best Indian movies of all time.

Although i watched the Hindi movie earlier and then later learned that it is remade based on this. but still was delight to watch

The characters are real strong. It might be really boring for few people because of long scenes.

I would recommend both the films for people who fell in love with this movie.

Also, please go through my list of must watch bolly wood movies. Anybody will love them. Although a lot them are rare to find on DVD. But most of it are probably available on youtube for free. i hope you like it.

26 May 2004,What a masterpiece!,"Just saw this film for the first time yesterday. For it's age, it's remarkably current as far as juror psychology goes. From the guy who wants to send the kid to his death because he has a baseball game to get to, to the old man with a perspective on life that can only come with age who has all the time in the world to discuss the case, this movie accurately portrayed how juries around the US deliberate cases every day. (or at the very least, how they should deliberate their cases)

It also brings up the interesting notion about how picking the right lawyer can mean all the difference. Had the defendants lawyer been more astute as to the details of the witnesses testimony, I don't think the prosecution would have had a case to stand on. In this movie, it was pretty much up to Fonda's character to do that work for him.

And on a side note, it was nice to see the actor who does the voice for Disney's Piglet in a pre-Disney acting role. When I first heard him speak, I KNEW that just HAD to be the voice of Piglet. Turns out I was right. Very interesting. :)

4 May 2000,"Quality, quality film making","Finally, a site that recognises quality when it sees it.

Being a big fan of star Fonda and director Lumet isn't a pre-requisite to liking this film; Those two performances are magic, but the expert way the tone is set, then tweeked to wring the emotion from every scene.....perfect

A film that, although made in black and white, has a vibrancy not often matched by todays efforts.

3 September 2000,Great Flick!,"Twelve Angry Men is a movie about a jury deliberating what appears at first to be a simple airtight case of murder. It ends up being an exploration of the psychology of the jury members. This film encompasses prejudice, stupidity, flippant behavior, and a few others. It revolves around the one juror, (Henry Fonda) having the guts to stand up to the crowd & voice his uncertainty with the conclusion that the others have reached. It then delves into this man's ability to turn the others to question their own understanding of the case by exploring the ""facts"" by using one's mind.

Excellent psychological study. I hear it has been remade but I haven't seen the remake.

4 September 2000,Imagine this dilemma,"Hello Friends,

When watching the film, I always put myself in the position of one of these jurors and wonder how would I have reacted. This film is a fascinating study of human interaction under extremely intense conditions. As you watch, play close attention to E.G. Marshall (in a brilliant performance) and his obvious facade of knowing that what he is doing is the ""wrong thing wrong"" and his struggle to convince himself that he is doing the ""right thing right"" and his realization that fools no one. I admire this film for its sheer electric performances (Cobb, Fonda, etc) and its first rate dialogue, but especially for its examination of the moral dilemma these men face...but then again, what do I know? :) Enjoy

16 April 2018,Review,"""Twelve Angry Men"" was one of the best movies I have watched. Even though it was filmed almost half a century ago, the movie was extremely engaging and constantly put its audience in suspense. The movie is about how 12 American jurors came together to decide whether Rican, a teenager was guilty of murdering his abusive father. The rule of the court was that if that there is a reasonable doubt, the boy would be not ""guilty"". At the beginning, Juror 8 was all alone in believing that the boy may not be guilty. The story then progresses when Juror 8 starts to use different tactics to win over the other Jurors. Personally, I was constantly awed and amazed by Juror 8's charisma and clever techniques. It was highly satisfying when Juror 8 were able to find ""flaws"" in seemingly impeccable concrete evidence, turning tables around. For instance, he re-enacted the testimony of the old man and proved that given the old man's walking speed, it is not possible for him to witness the boy running off. The movie was also highly captivating because all 12 actors were able to portray each juror and their unique personality very well, making the story highly realistic. For example, both Juror 8's charismatic personality and Juror 3 emotional and hostile personality were well played by the actors. Hence, even though the setting was simple, the story line and actors made this movie a classic. Furthermore, when complemented with Fisher ""Getting to Yes"" book, the negotiation techniques used by Juror 8 could be seen to still be highly applicable in today's world.",9
3 June 2023,a masterpiece and a must-see for any cinephile,"I highly recommend the film12 Angry Men (1957), a character study of twelve men charged with deciding the verdict in a death-penalty murder case.

12 Angry Men is a good story that began life as a stage play. However, I find it difficult to believe any stage production could be as affecting as this film. For example, the movie is in black and white, which is not possible in a stage play. And although most of the movie takes place in a small jury room, the camera meets the challenge and then some: we see human nature up close and personal.

IMHO the movie is a masterpiece and a must-see for any cinephile.

24 April 2014,One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen.,"I am only a teenager, but I am well-versed in classic cinema. When I began watching this film, I was skeptical that I would come out of it with any feeling other than boredom. It's a black and white film--the implication is that it may be slower than movies that are released nowadays. I've got to say: I LOVED THIS MOVIE! This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. I loved every second of it! It was full of suspense, amazing dialogue, and incredible acting. 12 Angry Men is on my list of my all-time favorite movies. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film.

12 Angry Men is perfection. I try to get all of my friends to watch this film. I haven't been this passionate about a film for a very long time. Whenever someone asks me what movies to check out, I always add this one on the list. I can't believe this movie isn't as famous as other classic films. I think this movie is deserving of every award out there. I have never rate a film a 10/10 on IMDb, but I was VERY close to making this my first and only 10/10 rating.",9
6 July 2001,Quincy makes good!,"Alright, so Jack Klugman may not be the only reason for enjoying this timeless movie, but it does help that he's in it!

To describe this film is an exercise in futility, it is as lifeless on the page as it is vibrant on the screen. For the record, a twelve-man jury debates on an apparently open and shut murder case. But the film is much more than the sum of it's parts. You hang on every word, the single set location becoming gradually more claustrophobic as the story gradually unfolds.

Each actor has a moment in the spot light that they make their own. The performances are at once clearly defined each actor right at the core of their character, and at the same time so believable that they appear naturalistic, that by the end, you don't even realise you haven't learned a single name!

28 October 2010,Twelve angry men,"I like this movie Twelve Angry Men, because this is an old black and white movie. The movie reminds me that when I was a little girl, my home had a small TV. The television screen also is black and white. At that time, neighbors came to my house to watched TV. They brought some food and fruit came to my house, then we talked together, ate together and everyone was happy. After we changed new TV, I watch black and white movie seldom. In the school, we watched Twelve Angry Men made me remember my old TV. Secondly, I like the story of the movie. From one man to all men agreed the boy was innocence, I think juror No.8 had good persuasion. He explained again and again, told other people the truth. Twelve different people have different personalities, but after they just united as one said ""not guilty""

On the other hand, the reason why I don't like this movie because of the movie was always talking and talking all the time and they didn't do many actions. Also, the movie just had two kinds of music as background in the whole scene. If the producer can add more kinds of music, that will be great. Moreover, I don't like the room; it was too small .Everyone smoked at a crowded place made the air so muddy and the temperature was so hot. In the room, everyone was sweat, the clothes was wet. The whole room was dirty. During the watching time, I felt so uncomfortable.",8
29 April 2013,The Power of speech!,"I hoped I would never have to tell anyone to watch this movie, hoped everyone had seen it. Maybe I conclude that everyone have seen it because it's my favorite. Few years ago me and my friend set up for a mission: to watch all of the movies in top 250 list on IMDb. It has not been finished yet, but it's going okay. No movie has ever cached me as Twelve angry men did. The movie shows the argument of a jury in a murder trial. Their case is a young boy accused of murdering his father. I can't point out one scene or one point in this movie that enchanted me. Maybe it's my addiction for old movies, or my love for Henry Fonda, I don't quit know. I like how every character in the movie has its own point of view in the case. There is though one thing that charmed me little more than anything else. It's the message that I take from the movie: The power of speech! I love how obvious it is in the movie. How Henry's Fonda character changes things that the other men found clear in the beginning, with nothing but words love it, really do! -Johanna http://2culture.com/index.php/movies/10-tvelve-angry-man

23 February 2014,Best movie ever?,"Always been one of my favourite films.

I'm a big fan of things exploding, spaceships, wars on a grand scale, some sex and violence, etc....but this film holds it's own in a single room, with just a bunch of folk arguing out the facts of the matter at hand.

Excellent performances all round, with Fonda delivering the performance of a lifetime. I'd also say that this is a film that has never been successfully re-made (in my opinion)....and never will be either. You can't improve on perfection, even though they have tried! If you've never seen this, then get it, watch it, and love it. If you don't, well....you're dead inside.

8 September 2014,it's just magnificent,"Wow. Simply wow. There is no other way to articulate the feeling you get after watching 12 Angry Men, perhaps the zenith of Sidney Lumet's remarkably talented directorial career, even more amazing considering this was his debut feature. It's just one of those rare golden gems of a film that gets everything, literally everything, absolutely right. Script, direction, performances, tone, setting, story, the lot. It's perfect. It's exciting. It's gripping. It's meaningful. It's moving. And it may be close to sixty years old, but all of the many things it's trying to say remain relevant to our society, and sadly perhaps always will. This truly is a cinematic masterpiece that deals with not only the rule of law and it's place in society, but along the way deep rooted prejudice, ego, the class system and the fragility of parenthood - all wrapped up in ninety short minutes. Honestly, this is no understatement... it's just magnificent.

28 September 2006,Greatness knows no time,"The greatness of this film is in the intelligent debate of logically trying to decide if a man is guilty or innocent. What takes place in this film transcends human thought. It follows a very precise and complex line of thought moving from one persons subconscious to the next analyzing the possibilities through countless view points. What makes this film stand out is the lack of information and the pure joy of examining the evidence ourselves and using the deductions by our 12 men to move with them toward their own conclusion. All people can identify with one individual or another in this film. It pulls us in, making us think about the possibilities. We argue ourselves really, right along with each juror until the very end. And wonderfully, we are left feeling vindicated. A classic for the ages!

27 November 2011,don't judge at the first look,"although it is all happening in a small room with some specific shots ,you can not take your look back from it until the last scene.it is all about not to judge anything at the first look.nothing is exactly like what it seems!!!one thing we can learn from this film is to learn how to negotiate.some of the characters had the ability of thinking wisely,ask other's opinions,respect other ways of thinking,paying attention to little parts of the story,getting them together and finally getting to a reasonable result.one great thing about the story is that no matter where you were born,how you grew up,what is your job,etc ,anybody has a wise inside man who will guide him and helps him to discover the truth.although it may take some long time for some people to recover the wise inside man!

3 August 2013,Amazing characters unfolding before your eyes,"I watched this film for the first time at the age of 18. I must admit that in the very beginning of the movie, I thought it seemed like just another boring ""old"" movie. But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting. The setting and the scene is as simple as it gets, and I would guess the movie budget was very low. Yet I got the feeling that it was very professionally made. I must say the actors did also did a really good job, and as in any classical movie, the ending is closely based on absolutely everything that happens during the whole movie.

To anyone who has not yet seen this movie I strongly recommend it. I am not sure I would see it again, because knowing the ending will spoil the movie.

16 August 2013,My All Time Fav :),"* This movie is a masterpiece due to its starkness. It also offers any filmmaker a perfect recipe for making a really good movie!

* How many movies are made today that are worth more than one viewing? This is certainly one of those classics you can watch repeatedly; and to think, this was not a mega budget flick either!

* I can relate to this film easily due to having a recent experience with jury duty. Certain things as depicted in this film may have been changed in recent years, but the basic truth remains the same. I found this movie quite fascinating!

* This is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever produced by Hollywood! Sidney Lumet was a very underrated director!

* Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances ever in this movie! I can watch it repeatedly!

* 12 Angry Men is one of my favorite motion pictures of all time! It has one of the best-written scripts and 12 fine performances from great actors!

* I watched it years ago and loved it back then. Even now when I watch this movie, it impresses me!

* This black-and-white movie is a MUST-watch for everyone. It is not just a courtroom drama, it is about human psychology - about the way we judge each other based on our own preconceived notions and prejudices!

* This is a timeless movie that will never age! The performances of Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are superb. The movie manages to achieve greatness without the use of any special effects or camera gimmicks, which is indeed worth noting!",9

9 July 2013,The best Court-Drama movie.,"There aren't many films that can illustrate the power of a strong script and superlative acting better than Sidney Lumet's 1957 classic, 12 Angry Men. There are no startling visuals, no bravura camera angles, and no special effects. Just twelve men - all jurors - on a hot, stuffy afternoon, in a single room, debating the guilt, or otherwise, of an 18-year-old boy from the wrong side of the tracks. That it kept me riveted for its entire length is a tribute to Reginald Rose's dynamite script (adapted from his own play), the superb acting that fleshes out each character (remember there are twelve here, and each one is more vivid than those in a slew of modern blockbusters), and the sure but restrained direction from Lumet.

The story is simple but no less relevant even now. A young, disadvantaged boy is charged with the stabbing murder of his father after an apparent heated argument. The case against him seems overwhelming, and the twelve jurors assigned to his trial retire to their chamber to decide on his fate. All are convinced of his guilt - all, that is, except juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He is not sure if the accused is guilty or not, but he wants to discuss the case a bit further. In the face of some stern resistance, especially from jurors like #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a spiteful man who has a personal reason to see the boy behind bars, #7 (Jack Warden), who just wants to record a quick verdict so he can catch a baseball game that he has tickets for, and #10 (Ed Begley), who is convinced that everyone in the boy's socio-economic group is a criminal, he starts to argue some of the prosecution's points. He points out some inconsistencies, and slowly some of the jurors come around to his point of view. Will he convince all of them there's enough doubt for a ""Not Guilty"" decision?",10
26 April 2021,Such a Classic yet Simple Film,"I remember watching this film in 9th grade after reading the short story in English class. I didn't think it was a great film at the time but watching it now, I find it really interesting. This film has different personalities and arguments to explain their views on the case. The camera angles were good, getting every detail that was important for the audience to see was filmed. The premise of the film, 12 men sitting in a room debating and fighting about a case is a really good premise and was really well done. I like how the creators gave each juror a personality such as the one who has prejudice, the shy introverted, out spoken, and so on. I gave this film a 9 out of 10 because it is a really well done classic and even though it was so simple, it was a really good film.

15 February 2017,One of the most realistic classic movies of all time,"The movie is based on a play, and almost the entire movie happens in a jury room. Such a small location, at first look, is more like a location for a play performance, not a movie. This fact leads us to think of a movie with more exaggerated acts. However, when you watch ""12 Angry Men,"" you realize that everything in the movie is so real, not only the setting but also the story, dialogues and characters. Compared to other movies at that era (or even today), ""12 Angry Men"" is not a long one (it is just about 90 minutes), yet, as Roger Ebert once said, it ""sometimes feels as if the movie is shot in real time."" From the moment that the jury members enter the jury room, we start to know them one by one and step by step through their short talks and conversations about simple ordinary things such as the weather or their jobs. And this is what in a real life happens. It is very interesting to me that, despite this fact that the movie was made about 60 years ago, the characters and their conversations seem very real and alive. I believe that everything in this movie is ahead of the time it was created. We all know that actors are performing their acts and delivering their dialogues directly and word by word based on the screenplay. Nevertheless, we never realize this fact when we are watching the movie. You think that everything is happening right before your eyes, exactly like what happens in a documentary movie. In a classic setting, usually there is only one character who speaks or acts, and others usually wait for him to finish his or her statement and then start to talk or act. This is not that common in real life because people react to others' statements or acts in a real-time, and do not wait for them to finish their words to show a reaction. In ""12 Angry Men,"" we see this kind of real scenes a lot. We see two or three characters speaking in front of the camera, and at the same time we hear other people's reactions or see some other actions in the background. everything is real, fast, and believable, exactly like what happens in our daily life.",9

15 January 2021,12 Angry Men(1957)- Review,"12 Angry Men is a courtroom drama displaying deliberations, as its name suggests, by 12 men who are part of a jury and have to make a consensual decision about an 18 year old boy who has allegedly stabbed his father to death and faces a death penalty. The boy does not come from a glorious background and with his violent past everyone quickly forms a judgment of him. Initially seeming an open & shut case with all evidence pointing fingers to the boy, all jurors unhesitatingly vote guilty in a preliminary vote apart from one, Juror 8 (Henry Fonda). While he too doesn't have very high regards for the boy, but believes the evidence collected can be questioned when thoroughly studied. With this he feels there is a reasonable doubt to the boy's involvement to the horrendous act. Other jurors already having made a conclusion in their mind initially get agitated by Juror 8 who is taking an opposite position to the general public & all the jurors. Without all jurors agreeing a verdict cannot be declared so they need to continue their deliberation, this fact adds to all the other jurors' frustration. The movie till the end displays the whole deliberation among the 12 men and Juror 8 trying to make the others realise that there is a faintest doubt if not a strong one. The movie may be made decades ago but still does not fail to capture the attention of any viewer be it of any generation. It is a brilliant production devising which would have required an exceptional mind. With only one location setting and majorly showing only the 12 men for almost the whole of the movie, might have initially caused ridicule in the ideation stage, but that concept of a single setting and just a little more than a handful of actors is what makes the film so amazing. The story/case is surely not the most expansive but with Fonda and the other actors gives a different depth which no one could have anticipated. The dialogues fairly well written keeping it precise and very much to the point. Some viewers may be discouraged with it being a black & white film, through the start that is a little uncomfortable but after a while you won't even realise it. Having been made in the 1950's it is a rarity to see a film having a run time under 100 minutes. There are very few if any aspects that can be deemed disappointing. 12 Angry Men is a must watch for everyone, it may be an old classic but its content is relevant even today.

22 October 2017,...,"r Twelve Angry Men (1957), is the gripping, penetrating, and engrossing examination of a diverse group of twelve jurors (all male, mostly middle-aged, white, and generally of middle-class status) who are uncomfortably brought together to deliberate after hearing the 'facts' in a seemingly open-and-shut murder trial case. They retire to a jury room to do their civic duty and serve up a just verdict for the indigent minority defendant (with a criminal record) whose life is in the balance. The film is a powerful indictment, denouncement and expose of the trial by jury system. The frightened, teenaged defendant is on trial, as well as the jury and the American judicial system with its purported sense of infallibility, fairness and lack of bias.

26 January 2018,Classic,"One of the classics. 2 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film; the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end. The defendant is referred to as ""the boy"" and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".

29 December 2003,Short and Sweet,"I have seen this film on more than one occasion, and it gets better every time I see it. The depiction of what goes on in a jury room is fairly accurate, but the way that the different characters from their respective backgrounds influence each other's decision about the case is interesting. It truly shows how the pressure of our peers can influence our perception of an event.

13 December 2011,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made,"If I told you a film was 50 years old, black and white, all of it takes place in one room, and has no comedy, you probably would think it to be a rather boring flick. Yet 12 Angry Men uses such an interesting character study and dialog it maintains our attention level the whole way through. The film does slightly drag at the beginning, but Fonda amuses us by gradually picking apart the case bit by bit. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. It belongs on the shelf of any movie lover. Cobb delivers an outstanding performance as a bitter, torn father who has had a rough relationship with his son. Fonda is displays one of the greatest performances I've ever seen as the average family man who turns the tide of jury. E.G. Marshall is the intelligent, cocky Juror 4. Ed Begley is a prejudice, heartless old timer. All of them deliver stellar performances in this classic film.

Because that is one of your biggest mistakes. In your movie life. :) (sorry for bad English) ""The visual strategy of the movie is discussed by Lumet in Making Movies, one of the most intelligent and informative books ever written about the cinema. In planning the movie, he says, a ""lens plot"" occurred to him: To make the room seem smaller as the story continued, he gradually changed to lenses of longer focal lengths, so that the backgrounds seemed to close in on the characters.""

5 February 2019,A movie that has a transcending power,"There are only a very few movies that has the actual power to travel through time. 12 Angry Men is a rare classic that would never deprive its quality regardless of any time period. Its a psychological drama that travels through the different kinds of stereotypical minds of people. This movie really discovers the general consciousness of a stereotypical society. It helps us to understand the difference between an angry mob and a civilized rational society. This movie, that is mostly shot inside one room, is a must watch for every movie lover from all across the globe.

20 April 2012,8.9 Are you kidding me?,"I'm one who likes to look at IMDb and watch some movies based on ratings from this site. This one is probably the most overrated movie I have ever seen.

People who are rating this movie great are just trying to impress you with the fact that they watched something that came out before they did. Seriously awful waste of time here. If you want a good older movie watch Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Casablanca or just about anything else over this.

I try to find good in everything and I just don't get why people give this one such a high rating. Nothing great about it. Boring as hell and not one thing good worth mentioning. Because of IMDb i had high expectations and boy am I rethinking this sites reviewers.

14 September 2017,so simple yet so great,"the actors tell us and show us so much into the lives of each character just with they're great acting. we get to see the different backgrounds of these men and how that affects the way they think and how they communicate with others.

although this was made in the 50s and lot has changed since then but i can be certain that this movie will remain one of the great throughout time wherever and whenever it is watched.

i remember watching it for the first time with my father when i was about around 14. the only black and whit film I've watched since then was the longest day i remember not wanting to watch it and urged my father to change the channel which he did not listen to and i am glad he didn't. it made a significant impact on what movies meant to me and this movie has been the starting point to my obsessions with films

20 June 2013,Twelve men. One room. Incredible dialogue.,"Having only watched this film recently, and with it still fresh in my mind, I can safely say that some of the best written arguments and put downs are featured in this film.

Henry Fonda is magnificent, showing that his character is a man of incredible bravery, standing up against 11 other men when he knows the decision about to made is wrong.

All in all, fantastic film and a true classic piece of cinema, which effortlessly stands the test of time due to thematic content which is all the more apparent in this day and age, as it was back then. With only one location and 12 characters, it's a film I would watch again and again.

26 June 2003,Best movie. Ever.,"Now, I've never been the type of person who is impressed by flashy set designs, special effects, non-stop action, etc. In fact, the most important things for me in any type of story (film, television, play, novel) is characterization. I'm a sucker for good, complex, three-dimensional characters. And dialogue. Boy, do I ever go crazy over good dialogue. This is most likely why 12 Angry Men is my favorite movie of all time. Twelve men, one room, fabulous acting, fabulous cast, fabulous dialogue. Brilliant.

The cast itself is enough to drive you crazy. Henry Fonda, one of my favorite actors of all time, leads the pack, with Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Jack Klugman, and E.G. Marshall putting in excellent performances too. In fact, this is one of Lee J. Cobb's best performances ever. He's tremendous in this role and you really just can't help but like him in the end. E.G. Marshall puts forth maybe the best performance in the entire film with his calm and intelligent character as the perfect balance to Cobb's angry and out of control character. Also, notable performances by Joseph Sweeney and John Fiedler, who are both entirely endearing.

There's not a lot to say about this amazing film. Anyone who has any interest in the American legal system should definitely watch this. If you appreciate good casting, excellent acting, and first-rate dialogue, you won't be disappointed. It's odd to think that a movie about twelve nameless men sitting around in one room talking for most of the movie could continue to be interesting the whole way through, but somehow they do it.",10

12 February 2017,It's great watch.,"Movie is realistic drama. Dialogues and Screenplay are incredible. Director has not unnecessarily stretched the movie. Thats makes it great watch. As the name itself suggests, Entire movie is about arguments between 12 men who are the member of a jury, which is presided to sentence or set free a child found guilty of a murder by the court. Entire movie is shot in a single room. Dialogues are aptly written, and situations are well crafted. Notwithstanding these features, movie leaves a simple yet important message. Here is the lesson of movie- Our personal biases overrides our ability to differentiate between right and wrong. Sometimes, We inadvertently become the captive of our biases. We should be always open hearted to accept our biases whenever someone point out, rather than being adamant.

19 January 2004,An Excellent Look Into the Jury Room,"12 Angry Men, I first saw when I was in law school a few years ago. I was blown away by what I saw. From a cinematic point of view, this movie has everything. The performances are top-notch, the writing is tight and fluid and the direction makes the viewer feel as if they are juror #13 actually sitting in the room.

From the legal standpoint, this movie should be shown to potential jurors to better understand what it is they are to do once they go into the jury room. Obviously, a jury like this one is a defense attorney's dream, but the vision of how jury deliberations play out has never been more wonderfully recreated than in this movie.

The remake that was made a few years ago was good, with fine performances by everyone, but the original is always better. 12 Angry Men, set entirely in one room for the duration of the film, with the jurors being the only actors seen on screen is one of the best dialogue driven films ever made. The characters and their traits come out through the deliberations, but we never learn the names of any of them, except in the last moments of the film. It is not about the characters, it is about the dialogue. I have yet to see a movie that can mimic this brilliance.",
25 November 2003,All-around Wonderful Movie,"This film nears perfection. Wonderfully acted (especially by Lee J. Cobb, who steals the show), wonderfully written-- this is a wonderful movie. Every scene is captivating, and it amazes me how it never gets boring, even though all but three minutes of it was filmed in the same room! ""12 Angry Men"" nears perfection and scores as an easy ten.

18 March 2016,Never boring,"Twelve men in a room for the duration of the movie. ""That' s boring"" I thought... Nope, never! It' s a dynamic plot and an interesting story, it captivates the spectators from the beginning until the end. No special effects, no complex scenery, not a refined location.

This film deserves to be watched, it' s a cross section of the society, of the human essence. The characters are simply perfect: all with different personality, job, life, etc. So they argue for the entire film, but Henry Fonda' s character turn the tide, he adds something special to the movie, he is the key for the other eleven jury members. Will they succeed in finding a verdict?!

30 July 2013,This movie is FLAWLESS!,"The movie was very well done,I mean it is flawless, I think if you look at it more carefully and from a different point of view,you can relate it to any argument in the history or the society...

For instance:let's assume that these man gathered in a room to talk about religion...every guy has his kind of beliefs:there are some extremists or a guy who doesn't care what's going on and just wants to live his life and not talk about these things! Except one guy he is not sure he doubts and wants to talk about it.

In this case(religion) it has not come to a valid point yet but it will... You can just like that relate this amazing movie to politics or even arguments between family members...

This movie is never getting old and I think everyone should watch this.

19 September 2014,All about the acting,"Brilliant casting, exceptional acting. Lumet very smartly kept most of the film in the jurors' room, which heightens the tension and forces the audience to pay attention to every small detail that is presented in the film. In no way does one feel constrained by the restriction to one location; rather, it is almost as if we are transported into the room.

The way the plot is laid out manipulates the audience's perception as well. Lumet invites us to make a judgment on the case at hand - although he also makes a point about how judgments can be easily changed and that perhaps we don't know ourselves as much as we thought we did.

Henry Fonda, especially, sells the character well. It is an honest depiction of real people and how real decisions are made. His argument - that he isn't sure if the accused is guilty but at the same time isn't sure if the accused is not guilty - is thought-provoking, as it acknowledges the ambiguity of life.

Overall, a well-presented film.",10
25 November 2016,Let's take off the nostalgia glasses,"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development.

19 August 2013,Fantastic movie,"This is a great movie. Not because it has chase scenes, giant explosions, or a 2-dimensional villain. No, this movies villain is presumption, and the characters themselves. The performances and its sheer simplicity is what makes it one of the best movies ever made.

Seriously, when I'm on YouTube I binge watch trailers and there are no movies like this anymore when the performances make the movie not the special effects.

The movies performances seem real. It seems like they're genuinely arguing. And they don't understand the weight they have on their shoulders. Like each characters has a different personality and different views and seem real.

In conclusion, seriously if you haven't seen this movie, see it. You will be blown away by the performances. This is the only movie I've seen that's a play and the idea needs to be supported.",10
8 September 2004,Amazingly cast with in-depth look at people and their misperceptions.,"This is one of the best movies that I think I have ever seen. Though it may be a little scary watching a movie that is in black in white, when you watch this movie, it would be hard to watch it in color. The basis of this movie is to prove that not everything is open/shut--hence black or white. Whoever wrote this movie did an excellent job showing how different all of the characters are. It is nice to see a movie that teaches us not to be so judgemental and to see the larger picture. Instances like this movie happen even today so it does not seem out dated. The brilliance of the writer is phenomenal. I cannot stress it enough how great this movie is. Watch It!!!

19 December 2014,Brilliant storyline,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10

27 January 2019,The One That Got Me Into Film,"It was 2011 when I saw this movie for the first time. A friend of mine recommended it to me. I was astonished from the very first second. How could such a ""simple"" plot make me feel so much into the story and its characters? The way Henry Fonda portrayed his character was perfect. I could feel exactly what he was feeling solely based on his expression. This movie is exceptional in the sound, lighting and cinematography areas. From the subtle rain sound on the outside to the heat perceived inside the room. It all just worked together very well to create a masterpiece! As I said in the title, this is the movie that made want to study sound for cinema and I don't regret it a bit!

5 September 2005,One of the great jury films,"This movie is incredible. This shows the progression of conscience during the film and how the will of a man can still be changed in debate. I am currently doing a course similar to legal studies and we watched this movie in class and I was totally enthralled. I must comment that usually law movies would often be either not enough about the law or to ""legal"" and thus become over exciting or on the tedious side. This movie is not about the court this is about what happens behind the closed door of the jury room. which certainly opens the eye to people that don't know much about what goes on in the court system. I highly recommend this movie to all interested in law movies though I am still yet to finish the movie in class it looks very enjoyable so far

If you liked this I also suggest seeing movies based on some of John Grishams novels such as The Pelican Brief starring Gene Hackman and Runaway Jury with Dustin Hoffman Gene Hackman and John Cusack and lastly The Rainman

17 October 2004,We stand on the shoulders of this giant,"The fact that the plot of this film is still credible and interesting nearly 50 years after it was made is a testimony to its strength. Each week for the last 20 years we have been bombarded with ""law and order"" shows which examine the guilt or innocence of suspects. (Even Jack Klugman from this movie got his own TV series on the subject called ""Quincy"", which was mostly about freeing people falsely accused, and nobody calls Klugman a bleeding heart.) *Some* of those thousands of shows are more interesting and plausible than 12 Angry Men. But as Isaac Newton once said, ""If I have seen farther than others, it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants."" People who nitpick and point out flaws in this script are failing to note that this show is one of the ""giants"" upon which all modern scripts are resting upon.

I did a calculation and found that the average number of *movies* that these 12 actors have been in is 66.75. At random I took another contemporary movie that was similarly rated, (""Sunset Boulevard"") and came up with the number 79.08 for the top 12 actors. Hmm. Maybe I should go watch Sunset Boulevard. Maybe it's more fair to compare ""12 Angry Men"" with a modern movie instead. A similarly rated Drama, ""Schindler's List"", scores only 46.41. Of course, these films are getting the benefit of the statistic because I'm counting only their first 12 actors, not the ENTIRE CAST.",

24 January 2017,A true classic,"Fantastic movie! This is simply a must see. It is a masterful representation of a conversation between 12 people sitting in one room. 12 people who don't know each other and are tasked with making a very important decision together. In a way, you feel like a 13th juror, you have an opinion once they enter the room, but the 12 men keep swaying you as they discuss and examine the case. The stakes are high and you feel the tension in the room. The combination of amazing writing and impeccable acting really bring the characters to life. This is one of the most intricate stories shown in one of the simplest settings which is why it is so unique. Every TV series that could, made an episode based on this movie and I think that says a lot.

8 August 2016,Acting is the most important thing in a movie,"People always ask me why i like 12 Angry Men that much. They usually say that it's too boring. Well, i know that this movie doesn't consist of thrilling action scenes and it takes place only in a small room. What makes this movie a masterpiece is the acting and it's reality. There are 12 jurors and each of them is random people, they aren't related so each of them has a different personality but they united for a reason they have to decide if a 18 year old boy killed his father.

When i watched 12 Angry Men i saw 12 different characters from my daily life because the acting was so perfect. We can also realize that how hard is to debate objective and this movie is also a stunning criticism to the American Jury System. If you planning to watch it, there is one important thing that i can recommend: Pay attention to jurors , try to understand their feeling , i can assure you that they will match with the people in your daily life perfectly.

Starting from acting and how each actor mastered thier characters, to the script how entertaining the dialouge was, to the smooth shooting in a single room and how there were no sharp cuts between the shots.

I just can say that Sidney Lumet was way ahead his age in this movie.

18 May 2013,One of the greatest films in history,"One of the best movies ever. Acting is superb. Absorbing story. Characters are unforgettable. This is the kind of movie that makes you think about our natural prejudices and how important it is to look beyond the superficial appearances to find the real truth. Everyone who ever serves on a jury should see this movie first. One of the things that makes this movie one of the greatest triumphs in cinematic history is that it is completely dialog and character driven. There are no cheap visual tricks or special effects needed to hold the viewer's attention, it's the story that keeps you glued to your seat. Even after all these years this movie is relevant and interesting.

13 November 2005,Oh the heat!,"One of the best things about the movie is the way the temperature rises along with the tension, until the rainstorm begins - and with the rain, the jurors are themselves prisoners until they can agree a verdict. And the way the characters interact is as good as any movie I can think of. And Lee J Cobb's performance is stunning - as different from many other roles he played as can be. His portrayal of anger and frustration is outstanding. Henry Fonda is as assured as usual - the voice of reason - but Cobb plays a man driven by his own demons who finally breaks, and as he does so, the jury are at last speaking with one voice. Keeping the cast almost exclusively in the same room serves well to heighten the tense animosities which stretch and test the will of each participant.

23 March 2018,The Perfect Movie With Such A Simple Idea,"At first glance, this movie might sound very boring, but after you watch it, you realize it's one of the most engaging and interesting movies you'll probably ever see. The whole film feels very natural, and you get to know the characters well by their interactions. It's building itself up like it's a huge action movie, although it only takes place in one room. This film also has plenty of insightful advice, such as never claiming the kid is innocent, but as Peter Fonda says, it's possible. All of the jurors have interesting personalities, all played by phenomenal actors. I would highly give this film a recommendation to everybody. This film must be shown more.

29 May 2018,You'll never forget the first time you see it.,"12 Angry Men is such a simple concept, masterfully executed by Director Sidney Lumet.

12 Jurors must vote unanimously to decide whether or not a young man is guilty of murdering his father. The film is set into motion when all but 1 of the 12 jurors vote guilty.

Juror No.8 (Henry Fonda) makes the case that the young man on trial could be guilty however he wants to consider the case a little more before deciding to vote and ultimately deciding the fate of the accused. As tensions start to run high Juror No. 8 faces an uphill battle to convince the other 11 jurors there may perhaps be more than meets the eye.

When I was watching it for the first time I felt like I was Juror No.13, constantly on the edge of my seat awaiting the next big revelation.

On a promotional piece for the film it says ""IT EXPLODES LIKE 12 STICKS OF DYNAMITE!"". I couldn't agree more. 12 Angry Men is a riveting, powerful and uplifting experience that's message is still relevant today.

Without a doubt it will always be one of my favorite movies of all time.

What are you waiting for? Go watch it ;)",10
20 November 2015,"I never thought I'd like black and white movies, this changed my mind","I'm a 22 year old movie lover, born in 1993 and I was sure I only cared about movies in colour, made after a certain point in time. Yet I recently decided to watch as many movies as I cold from the ""top 250 movies voted by IMDb users"" as I could, but held out on this one because it was old and not in colour.

Never have I been so wrong, and never have I been so glad I gave a movie, I probably otherwise would never have watched, an honest chance. I have also never written a movie review on here because I didn't think I was qualified, but this movie deserves all the praise it can get.

This movie might just be one of the best I have seen, and there are multiple reasons for that.

I personally like when someone is able to take a simple concept and make it interesting and much deeper than it first appears, especially when it come to movies, and especially when it also involves analyzing the human psyche / the way humans think.

This movie does not only do that, but at the same time presents an excellent variety of 12 everyday but still VERY different characters, all with different viewpoints and ways of thinking, all of whom is set with the difficult task of deciding if an 18 year old boy from the slums is guilty of murdering his own father or not. And all this, the entire movie takes place in single room with only these 12 characters and a table between them.

The 1 hour and 36 minutes this movie is just flew by, I was that taken away by the characters and their arguments for the young boy being guilty or not guilty.

To me that is fantastic movie-making, and the kind of movie i will let myself be inspired by if / when I myself become a director.

10 / 10, I recommend this movie to any serious movie lover, and it absolutely still applies to a modern audience, I am a good example of that.",10

24 July 2013,Why 12 angry men should be number 1 on IMDb top 250 list.,"I don't know whether I will give any movie a 10 on 10 rating ever in my life again, but 12 angry men is such a movie even a whole 10 is an understatement to describe it's magnitude and brilliance.

I strictly follow the IMDb top 250 list and I have made it my personal mission to see and understand each one of them to the best of my ability. So obviously when I saw 'The Shawshank Redemption' on number one I saw it and gained a perception that it was the most complete and meticulous movie I have ever seen. But that was until the day I witnessed '12 Angry Men'.

Personally, I am not a very big admirer of court room drama or anything related to court room drama. There are very few court room dramas which I like. So I wanted to try this movie out as I heard a lot from my fellow movie buffs. Black and white picture and the camera rolled on filming each and every corner of the New York City courthouse. From the initial scenes I thought that I was in for a boring court room drama. But I was kind of optimistic when the scene of court room was over in some minutes and the 12 jury members came into the room. From there I was mesmerized.

Short, crisp, witty, and outstanding are some of the adjectives which I can use. The way the movie portrays the differing mindsets of the jury members and especially my personal favorite Juror number 5 played by Lee.J.Cobb, it gives the movie a different and unusual edge which I don't find in other dramas.

It will be cruel of me to compare 'Shawhshank Redemption' and '12 Angry Men' but when it is a matter of ranking there must be some aspects where the both can be compared. Both of the movies are excellent in their own ways. But, for me 12 Angry men takes the edge over Shawshank Redemption in the area of script and idea. Shawshank redemption spans over a variety of areas and characters which in itself gives the movie an edge over others, although I am not questioning the acting capabilities of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I was engrossed and enthusiastic throughout the whole movie and it gripped me. But to create that same effect in a small and claustrophobic room of a courthouse is according to me a much more arduous. 12 angry men doesn't have a huge surrounding which elevates the viewers experience of seeing the movie apart from the dialogues. It only had 12 rational, emotional, and sweaty jurors who were in an intense deliberation of murder case.

Another small fact which I noticed in the movie was the close up shot of the young boy whose trial was going on. That shot must have lasted for only seconds, but those that small face shot captured the sadness, bewilderment, abhorrence and insecurity of the boy. For me, that small scene was one of the best schtick I have ever seen.

Although I have no problem with seeing long movies which span for 3 to 4 hours, but I got my so called 'viewer's satisfaction' in one and almost two hours on seeing 12 Angry Men and that too to an extent a little more gratification than 'Shawshank Redemption'.

For me, 12 Angry Men till now is the best flick I have seen till date. I am waiting for such a film who can knock this one from the mantle. Till then, next time.",10

10 January 2002,My All-Time Favorite Movie,"I have seen this movie dozens of times, but each time I see it I am still riveted. Each time I see different nuances in the characters and the acting that I might have missed previously. The characters are so well crafted and 3-dimensional that by the end of the film you also feel as if you have been locked in the jury room along with them. Words can hardly do this film justice. If you haven't already seen it, check it out. If you have, watch it again. A truly phenomenal film.

12 May 1999,Classics: The kind of films Hollywood has forgotten,"This all began when I saw the new version of ""12 Angry Men"" in the New Release section at the video store. I had never seen the original, so I said to myself, ""Well if they remade it, the original must have been pretty good."" So, I got the original and watched it. Most of the movie was in one room, there were no computer generated graphics, and no explosions, yet this movie beat the pants off of any ten random movies selected from this past year. Aside from independent films (thank god), the film industry has come to rely too heavily on star power, special effects, and cheap sex and violence to make their hits. ""12 Angry Men"" was so refreshing because it was original and captivating, yet simply done. I fully recommend it to anybody.

6 August 1999,"Quite simply, my all time favourite film....","If the test of a great film is one that you can view time and time again and not get bored with it, then this is without doubt a great movie. It shows that, in this age of multi-million dollar budgets and incredible special effects there is no substitute for a good story and good actors.

If you've never seen it then watch out for the acting of Lee J. Cobb - Oscar winning and very well deserved.

2 August 2013,A really intense plot,"I watched this movie because a remarkable teacher from university recommended it to me, I have to say I really loved it, I have to admit I really got excited with some of the comebacks these gentlemen made during their argument.

There are no expensive cars, attractive women, guns or explosions, but the plot is really intense even when is as simple to make a choice.

What you get to see is twelve different gentlemen with really interesting personalities (each one of them) arguing and some of them expose their past lives, making the process of decision even harder; the only scenario is one closed room, which actually makes you a little anxious (at least in my case) since there, the twelve men will spend the next hours arguing to make a final choice.

5 October 1999,An excellent adaptation of an excellent play!,"I had read the actual play ""Twelve Angry Men"" about six years before I saw this film. It was everything I remembered and better. The development of each character was masterfully done and the setting was imaginative yet realistic. This story gives the viewer a new faith in the judicial system. I was incredibly impressed with the whole production and would recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand the circumstances surrounding the jury deliberations depicted. If you have ever been on jury duty, I'm sure this movie will either bring back memories or make you realize your turn wasn't as bad as you thought.

4 June 2000,Theatre Brought To The Screen,"Whilst reluctant to give any film a score of 10, the lack of a 9.5 option means there was no other choice. Every character is portrayed to perfection by a stellar cast. Although it is Fonda's film as the Man in the white Suit the ensemble give a structure and balance that is required in such a claustrophobic setting. Lumet's direction is first class and not even Citizen Kane rewards repeat viewing as much as this. The premise is simple but the execution of such a tight script with no gimmicks is inspired. If you have seen the poor remake, do your self a favour and revisit the original. Best movie of all time? Well in a genre yes, it is certainly one of my favourites.

23 November 2002,"No special effects, just great acting and direction","With the evolution of DVD people like me are getting the chance to watch films they would otherwise never be able to see. 12 Angry Men is one such film, and I rented it purely on the basis that it sits so highly in the IMDB Top 250.

I'm glad that I did, as it is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The basic plot revolves around a jury deliberating on a murder case that will send the accused to the electric chair, if he is found guilty. A preliminary vote is taken, and all but one of the jurors vote for guilty.

Over the course of the movie the one juror who votes not guilty (Henry Fonda) makes his case, and the other jurors being to realise that the verdict is not as clear cut as they first thought. One of the interesting things about this movie is that each juror has their own reasons for their opinion, be it the facts of the case, or personal prejudices, and over the course of the movie these are confronted and explored.

Despite being set in a single room, this movie is constantly entertaining, due to the acting and direction. The film feels incredibly tense and claustrophobic as a result of this. It was only afterwards I found out that Sidney Lumet also directed Dog Day Afternoon, another great movie that is based entirely in one setting.

In an age of special effects and the constant high budget dross being pumped out of Hollywood, it's refreshing to see a movie based purely on dialogue and acting ability. There have been too few of these in recent years, although a few do come to mind- Glengarry Glen Ross, Swimming With Sharks, Usual Suspects, Memento.

Many people today may see the date this movie was made or the fact that it is in black and white and not bother watching it. If they do they are missing out on a classic. I'm actually surprised this film hasn't been remade over the years, but maybe it's for the best that it hasn't.

Well worth watching.",9

The intense drama, the emotion, the atmosphere that has been created in the movie with mere words and remarkable acting performances by each one of the actors is impeccable. This movie keeps you glued to your seats for the whole duration.

I believe the young and aspiring actors should definitely watch this movie and learn how to bring the emotions of the character that they want to play out and, become the character rather than just portraying it.

9 February 2003,Hooked to it,"When I took the DVD of this film along with a couple of other movies from library, I postponed seeing this one after reading about the movie in the back cover of DVD. It had been mentioned that all but 3 minutes of the movie has been shot in a room. The movie was black and white and there was no female cast!!. Finally when I found some time when there was no other thing to do, I watched this movie, my god I was hooked. This movie is a great lesson to new directors and screen play writers as to how a great movie can be made without all the gorgeous locations, millions of dolllars, graphic special effects etc. Infact once the cast get into the jury room there is not even a back ground score. All natural sound recorded at the set. As some body else had mentioned Lee J cobb steals most of the scenes, but Henry Fonda's performance is great as a soft sell/submissive player. He carefully releases one card after other from his hand at precise moments.

For example he does not tell any one he has a switch blade knife untill others really push him and challenge him about the rarity of the knife. That is a genius.

Infact I watched the movie two times back to back and I could not help but marvel where all this talent nowadays. I was tempted to watch it third successive time but did not do it because it was late.

14 January 2015,Simply Brilliant !!!!!,"Pound for pound, Sidney Lumet still has the finest filmography of all the New York giants (sorry, Marty), and to think he began his features career with this brilliant character study is to blanch at the man's gifts. Set in a single jurors' room over the course of a long summer's day and evening, Reginald Rose's scenario started off as a teleplay—just as Lumet himself came from the quick-fire world of live broadcast drama. But the director seized on the technical freedoms allowed him by an ace cameraman (On the Waterfront's Boris Kaufman), ratcheting up the claustrophobia with every close-up. Often, these dozen jurors seem on the verge of blows; the movie, dealing with a murder trial, is about persuasion, but it also showcases New Yorkers' distinct talent for coexisting in tight quarters.

Yet who would mind such company? Justly, 12 Angry Men is celebrated for its uniformly terrific cast, chiefly Henry Fonda's soft-spoken advocate and Lee J. Cobb's resistant blowhard, racked with daddy issues and not about to let an ungrateful teen go free. A closer look at the performances reveals a minimum of Method fussiness, the grace notes of Jack Warden's jokey baseball fan and Robert Webber's Mad Men–esque smoothy landing in quiet harmony. Meanwhile, too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.",10

11 November 2002,"Brilliant, quite brilliant","Simply one of the greatest movies ever made and proof that great movies do not necessarily require extravagant settings or spectacular action.

The screenplay by Reginald Rose is first-rate, Lumet's direction is brilliant and all twelve actors have got meaty rôles which they carry off superbly. What makes it so good is that the characters are believable, not the usual Hollywood stereotypes. All the performances are terrific, with Lee J. Cobb perhaps as the stand-out.

The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",10
16 September 2017,justice can not be brought to a hurry,"A movie that shows how people's views can be mistaken. And how thin a line of justice can be achieved. Once I have seen this film, I have once again realized that we should think more precisely when giving judgment.

12 Angry Men (1957) made me wonder about the jury system. I have a different system in the country i live in and i still do not know which one is better but maybe there is no better system, there is only a better person.

29 January 2023,everyone should watch this movie,"I think every person in the world should watch this movie. This movie can be show in all schools at a certain age level within the moral philosophy course.

17 December 2015,A timeless movie that captures the essence of filmmaking.,"Due to the age of this movie, I was skeptical when I first approached it. I see that in some cases, movies of a certain age are held on a pedestal even though they have either been bested or have not aged well. Thankfully, this movie is neither. 12 Angry Men is a premise that is not easily done. A movie that takes place mostly in one room is not that exceptional, but 12 Angry Men is handicapped even further because we know nothing about the characters, not even their names. Nevertheless, the cinematography, writing and acting in this movie are nearly flawless, and have aged like fine wine. Having said all this, the movie is not without errors. The writing feels to be forced at some points of the movie, and the leaps in logic are sometimes hard to fully get behind. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men is one of the best examples of how timeless a movie can be, and how limitations can help a film become a masterpiece.

17 November 2006,"Wonderful, intriguing movie","""Twelve Angry Men"" is a simple movie in that it's setting is a single, solitary jury room and it's ""excitement"" lies in the intriguing relationships and dialog between jurors during deliberation. What could be more simple than that? The trick to this movie is the powerful storyline and the absolutely magnificent acting. That said, ""Twelve Angry Men"" needs no special effects, mind-boggling action scenes or a beautiful actress co-star - instead, it relies on good, old fashioned movie making for it's intrigue. In may ways, ""The Breakfast Club"" reminds me of this movie (without the courtroom, but with a school library instead). Both movies make statements about society's biases and inequalities while exploring each character's ""stand"" on the matters at hand. At the end of both movies, all characters involved understand each other a little bit better. If you like powerful story lines and brilliant acting, this movie is for you.

5 January 2010,What is on trial,"12 Angry Men is a film that takes place entirely in the jury room of the deliberation on a murder case. With the finest of acting, this film guides the audience through the details concerning the murder. At first, the jury box is almost overwhelmingly against the suspect. However, through unbiased questioning of by one of jurors (the only one that is truly unbiased) the audience is quickly drawn in as they realize that it is not the suspect that is on trial, but rather personal bias. This movie is sheer genius and will thrill the audience as they begin to ask questions such as what do we know and how do we know it. This is truly a great film.

10 October 2014,the good movie with a bit of knowledge,"the movie is really so great..director deserve great round of applause here for this movie.he came up with a brilliant idea of seeing a problem in all the possible ways and coming up with a entirely different solution to a problem.He mostly focused on judiciary and how innocents are being made into picture without even doing a crime.he had stand for his belief even when everyone doesn't even agree or disliked.he stood for what he believed and received many types of emotional stress in defending the crime suspect but he proves that he is not guilty.great work on the primary suspect.great work by the director focusing how he handled the situation with what he had. all the people those who acted contributed their equal share in making the film absolutely best and trend setter in deciding who is guilty and who are not in respective fields.

1 May 2023,Lesson in law and justice,"A very short movie , yet a very important one - probably the most important in law and justice up to date. It is simple and clear with its lesson - never judge a book by its cover and everyone is innocent until proven guilty. A great throwback to the standards we should set before blaming anything on anyone too soon, especially today with cancel culture.

29 August 2014,Fantastic. Case closed!,"I'm watching all 250 films on the list, I wasn't looking forward to this at all.

I was expecting some slow moving bore-fest, over-rated by jumped up AS level Law students, but I was more wrong than tongue kissing your dog.

The characters are written and performed so naturally (and brilliantly) the whole film feels genuine, something lacking in modern cinema.

The development of the plot is wonderful and at just over 90 mins the pace is perfect. It was like watching dominoes fall, but the dominoes were the vices of the jury.

Well worth it's position, well worth your time. Warrafilm.

16 June 2015,One of the all time best movies,"You know you have a great story when there's no need for location changes, special fx, or gimmicks. 12 Angry Men takes us on a journey by examining what is truth vs perception of truth when personal viewpoints, emotions and prejudices are attached. You are left asking yourself how hard is it to be truly unbiased while someone's life hangs in the balance. Are you sure what you believe is what you believe under intense scrutiny and in the presence of undeniable truth. The cast is excellent and each character is markedly different from the next which makes every bit of dialog and interaction be it verbal or non-verbal very tense at times and also suspenseful. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8. He soon becomes the ringmaster of this jury room circus. His chief antagonist will be juror # 3 played by Lee J. Cobb. These two couldn't be more polarized on the issue of guilty or not guilty. Each argument that is presented by each juror must be examined, re-examined, and proved without a reasonable doubt. Layers of the proverbial onion are peeled back until we are left with nothing but raw unadulterated truth. It may very well be the truth not about guilt or innocence, rather truth about ourselves.",9
30 December 2014,simple and good,"in the beginning of the movie I was so sad because the movie was too old and my teacher MR. king forced me to watch it ,so that made me feel crazy, but with passage of time I loved it because the events had become really exciting. there is one thing make me angry all of the actors were sweating and at the end of the movie they discovered that there was a cooling fan W!!. honestly the movie idea was simple and wonderful also the story was amazing and didn't cost them a lot. we should not forget that the movie was in 1957 ,so there is no effects at all. the movie was also very useful for those who are like me want to learn English. At the end I wanna say thanks for MR. King who forced me to watch it. 4c

1 January 2015,Simple movie with good story.,"First of all, we agree this's old movie. This movie was produced more than fifty years. We can't comparing this movie with any movies made after 2000C or 1980.

Second, I didn't like it. Because in first part I felt bored. Just 12 men tolling shot story and make it long. All of them was in one location. It's a small room for all of times with a lot of sweating :). Anyway, I saw this movie in Mr. King class. I think he liked this movie to much. I saw him passion when he a play it to us in our class. But when he do it again and again I see a good part of all parts in this movie. It's a story. I think we lost this kind of stories in modern movies. 4C

8 August 2016,Story is the Boss,"12 Angry Men is A jury-room Drama Starring Henry Fonda,Martin Balsam among others.Sydney Lumet Directed this Movie based on a Screenplay by Reginald Rose.

The Film starts of with The trail of 18 year old boy who is Convicted of murder of his father.The Judge Seems bored because all evidence points to Boy being guilty.After this The Case is sent to a jury room of 12 members who need to vote on it and decide if the boy is really guilty.The Law states that all 12 of them must vote the same.Everyone thinks the case is one sided except for jury #8,our protagonist.Ever One is taken aback by his vote.jury #8 explains that there might be a probability that the kid is innocent but even he is not sure.Rest of the story revolves around the arguments they have and the conclusion they arrive at.

The main strength of this Movie is Its story and its characters.As we progress through the story we get interesting details about each characters and makes them unique and realistic.The Films also has a very interesting Mystery which is revealed bit by bit as the Story progresses.This makes it far more interesting.The director of this film did a great job in showcasing all these characters without getting clumsy and also interweaving a great story. The Cinematography and Score of this are also excellent and improve the film.

Though this film excels in almost all aspects it sometimes feels unrealistic in some parts as characters suddenly remember minute things that happened during the trial 2 months ago and this makes a case for the jurors.

Despite this slight flaw 12 Angry Men is a timeless classic which goes on to prove that Big Budget and CGI Are not required to make a great movie.All it requires is a strong Script and characters to carry it.",10

19 May 2023,The Pinnacle of Perfection,"12 angry men is an hour and thirty six minuets of pure beauty. It consist of jaw dropping cinematography, toe curling writing, and tear giving dialogue, this movie was impressively ahead of its time. Adapted flawlessly from the play written by Reginald Rose, this movie stays true to its source material, and yet has so much creative flow. There is not one point in the hour and thirty six minuets of twelve people talking in a room that is boring. From the start to the end, the suspense is rising, the character development is emasculate, you can feel your relationship between characters growing. This absolute underrated hidden gem of a film deserves nothing less than ten stars.

16 July 2017,A True Classic,"12 Angry Men is a gripping drama where we meet our titular characters and these men must decide the fate of a young man who has allegedly committed murder. Almost the entire film is located inside a hot, small jury room where the men quickly agree to take a vote before any discussion as a jury. All of the men vote guilty except for one who is played by Henry Fonda. Throughout the course of the film, Henry Fonda's character attempts to explain to his fellow jurors why he stands against them.

The film's minimal location use allows it to focus entirely on the characters and the actors' performances. Even though none of the characters are given an actual name to identify them with until the end of the film, we get a good idea of what type of person each man is. There are small scenes that reveal the backstories of each of the jurors and the personalities of the men are quickly established once the debating starts. The heart and soul of the film lies in its ability to show how these very different men can come together or clash. The characters feel very natural and all the actors in the film do a good to great job performing their roles with standout performances by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb.

This is a must watch if you're at all interested in great characters, acting, and writing.",10

This movie is almost entirely shot in the jurors debate room and really does an amazing job at getting the viewer to really focus on who the characters are as people and how they would be in their day to day lives. The acting in this film is second to none and easily became my favorite movie of all time. This film proves that you don't always need hundreds of explosions and action scenes to make a good movie. All in all, this movie should be watched by everyone in the world that appreciates a real genuine movie.

5 May 2023,Its good one to show on TVs.,"""12 Angry Men"" is a classic film that has stood the test of time, and for good reason. The film takes place entirely in a jury room, where twelve men must come to a unanimous decision on the fate of a young man accused of murder. The tension in the room is palpable from the beginning, as each juror brings their own biases and prejudices to the table. What unfolds is a gripping exploration of justice, morality, and the power of persuasion. The film's strength lies in its script, which is tightly crafted and full of nuance. The performances by the all-male cast are top-notch, with each actor bringing their own unique perspective to the character they portray. Henry Fonda, in particular, shines as the lone holdout in favor of acquittal, and his quiet determination in the face of overwhelming opposition is inspiring to watch. The direction by Sidney Lumet is masterful, using camera angles and lighting to heighten the tension and create a claustrophobic atmosphere. ""12 Angry Men"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that is a must-see for anyone interested in the criminal justice system or human nature itself.

25 September 2022,Amazing Film.,"I'm not the usual demographic to watch ""older films"", but this film.. WOW. The plot was outstanding, just the way it was written was beautifully, and it all just shows the way society was back in the 1950s... all men in the jury, no women, and all white men.

It just ultimately counts down the different stages of all of the character's ideas on the boy's murder crime, and it shows the characters emotions very well, the performance it outstanding by all of the actors I must say. Especially Henry Forda and Lee J. Cobb, whom both oppose each other's ideas, but then later agree with each other, which was a beautiful part of the film, since Cobb's character was very mysterious and we never find out what was the issue between his son and himself, whether it was a good relationship, or a bad father and son relationship, but it influenced him to then be complete with his ideals of agreeing with Henry's opposition to believe the crime was not guilty. 5/5 for me.

3 August 2015,12 Angry Men (February 14/15),"Sidney Lumet's first film, 12 Angry Men follows a dozen jurors as they attempt to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. It's a simple premise that's employed to sporadically electrifying effect by Lumet, as the director, along with screenwriter Reginald Rose, does a superb job of introducing each of the (nameless) twelve men of the title - with the uniformly stellar performances going a long way towards initially luring the viewer into the claustrophobic proceeds. Star Henry Fonda delivers a typically compelling and thoroughly charismatic turn as the lone juror convinced of the accused's innocence, with the actor's magnetic work matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Jack Klugman, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Lee J. Cobb. (The latter is often riveting as Fonda's most vocal and tenacious opponent, and there's little doubt that the film is at its best when focused on the two characters' increasingly contentious arguments.) It's not terribly surprising to note, however, that 12 Angry Men's dialogue-heavy structure results in a decidedly erratic midsection, with the movie's few lulls stemming mostly from the characters' penchant for small talk. This is a minor complaint, of course, for what is otherwise an above average drama, and it's clear, too, that the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.",

13 August 2023,A Riveting Exploration of Justice and Prejudice,"""12 Angry Men"" stands as a timeless masterpiece, compellingly directed by Sidney Lumet and originally adapted from Reginald Rose's teleplay. Released in 1957, the film revolves around the gripping narrative of a jury deliberating the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. While the premise might sound straightforward, the movie ingeniously delves into the complex layers of human psychology, prejudice, and the pursuit of justice.

Set almost entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a jury room, the film's masterstroke lies in its character-driven storytelling. Each of the twelve jurors brings a unique perspective and personality to the table, brilliantly portrayed by an ensemble cast of talented actors. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Juror #8, a thoughtful and reasonable man who questions the rush to judgment, anchors the narrative. His calm demeanor and unwavering commitment to exploring the evidence form the heart of the film.

The movie excels in building tension through verbal clashes, heated debates, and evolving alliances among the jurors. As the deliberations unfold, it becomes evident that the case is far from open-and-shut. The script confronts issues of prejudice, personal biases, and the weight of responsibility. With each passing moment, the audience is confronted with their own judgments, mirroring the internal struggles of the characters on screen.

The cinematography, while seemingly constrained to the jury room, is a testament to Lumet's skill. The camera angles and lighting are meticulously used to highlight the shifting dynamics among the jurors. Close-ups capture the sweat, doubt, and determination etched on their faces, adding to the film's palpable tension.

""12 Angry Men"" stands as an enduring exploration of human nature and the fragile nature of justice. It underscores the power of open-mindedness and the need to question assumptions in the pursuit of truth. The movie's themes continue to resonate today, making it not just a classic of its time but a relevant and thought-provoking piece for generations to come.",10

15 January 2017,Pure classic,"From the acting to the writing to the direction, you'll really be hard to find a finer film. Henry Fonda is terrific. The conflicts are real and grounded, as the collection debate the finer points of the case. In addition to illustrating wonderful storytelling, it's a great examination of the idea of what a jury is all about. What is means to determine your judgment in the case, and what defines reasonable doubt. It's a perfect illustration of what our legal system is supposed to be. Idealized, perhaps, but realistic. What often determines our decisions. The prejudices that often cloud our perspective. Also how often the way we see things are not guided by the events or people themselves, but our own personal demons and experiences.

26 August 2016,Simple but great.,"Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.

But the fact that it has been listed among the best movies in history of cinema was tempting me to watch it. Finally, I watched it and I confess it worth every second of it. It was Unbelievably Fascinating.

The feeling during the movie was the same great feeling of reading a well structured book. I have never experienced such a pleasant feeling while watching movies from any kind.

4 September 2013,zzzzzzzzzz,"One word should sum up this movie: BORING

This movie is just NOT for everyone. Unless everyone now means everyone who does not mind to to watch a couple hours of a small group of man arguing in a closed room in black and white.

Compare a movie like this to something which is enjoyable on every level, has as a great story, possibly a great adventure, that might have a couple laughs in it, maybe visuals, maybe some other pleasant moments, that can move your heart, and make you feel moved after you've watched it.

So the next time someone tells you go watch the angry man it's for EVERYONE, maybe you can learn something from it.

just tell them: it's definitely not for EVERYONE. As great as it might be at what it's trying to do, it's still BORING to me.

21 August 2023,Brilliant,"Never in my life was i so captivated by a movie, i felt like i could've watched it for hours on end and felt somewhat sad when the movie reached its ending due to how emmersive every dialogue was.

I paused it 3 times so no shuffle or chatts would disturb my experience, i never did that with a movie before, absolutely brilliant, i wish the new directors would take something so simplistic as this movie's plot was and make it into a work of art more often, it's much more emmersive and exciting than any blockbuster could be.

This movie proves how much you can do in a limited set with a great script, great director and great actors and how much more impact that has on a viewer than the action packed CG-d movies we see today.

1 August 2018,"A shining example of ""less is more""","Hearing about the concept of a film where 12 men are in one room for the entire film, you would think it would be a boring experience. However, the result we get is one of the most compelling stories every told in film. Performances, camera work, writing, just about everything is met with incredible talent and purpose. The way the camera shots slowly become more zoomed in on the characters as the movie progresses and the situation becomes more intense. Realistic reactions and viewpoints over the court case. This movie puts you in their shoes, and you will likely end up discussing with your friends what you would have done if you were part of this story. Truly a masterpiece and a must watch for anyone who enjoys a good dialogue driven narrative.

4 April 2023,"Gritty, Emotion, Superb","The atmosphere is terrific, cinematography captivating and performances perfect. I was surprised there was less coverage of the actual trail, so it's not so much a 'courtroom drama', which sets this movie out as unique immediately.

This movie had been on the watchlist for so long, and I am so glad I took the time to watch it. The craft needed to hold an audience for 90 minutes when the movie is set more or less in one room, with a cast of misfit characters interacting.

Having been part of a Jury myself, this is very remeniscent of a Jury room and the arguments people make to sway others their way. You can perfectly understand why some hung juries exist, as to have a dozen very different people, with different moral compasses and different ideas of common sense.

11 August 2016,"Succinct, Intriguing and Enlightening","Succinct, extremely intriguing and enlightening, 12 Angry Men revolves around a jury of twelve men who are tasked with the responsibility of deciding the fate of a young boy charged with the murder of his father.

The movie, almost completely shot in a small jury room, manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout. The movie begins at the end of the trial, where the judge solicits a unanimous decision from the jury and sends them off to discuss the case. An initial vote, reveals that eleven out of the twelve men are convinced that the boy stabbed his father to death, beyond any reasonable doubt. Only one man persists with the vote of not guilty, much to the consternation of others. His sole purpose being to have a proper debate before sending a man to his grave.

The movie follows the course of the discussion, as it evolves and the evidence and testimonies are carefully scrutinized. Preconceived notions, prejudices and personal histories rise to the fore making things complicated. The movie brings out the fallacies of the jury system and at the same time questions the reliability of testimonies and other such evidence. It also preaches the virtue of standing up for what one feels and at the same time accommodating others point of view. Putting aside ones biases and examining facts objectively is shown to be a praiseworthy trait.

Some brilliant acting performances and a great story-line make it an absolute must watch. The aggression and temper of Lee J. Cobb is well contrasted with the calm and open-mindedness of Juror number 8 played by Henry Fonda. The meticulous logic applied by E.G. Marshall's character, the insensitivity shown by Jack Warden's and the huffing- puffing Ed Begley are all quite believable. This short drama left me mesmerized and wanting for more. A movie not to be missed.",9

Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

25 August 2001,"Not much I can say really, other than...","...I did like this film a lot! There not much to it (which is good), twelve guys locked in a room fighting to decided whether the young defendant guilty or not guilty. But director Sidney Lumet (Serpico & Dog Day Afternoon) does this so very well it goes down as a cinematic classic. Mr. Henry Fonda (Jezebel & My Darling Clementine) is brilliant as Juror #8/Mr. Davis. 8.75/10.

20 October 2016,Its hard to get a better one!,"What make this story so compelling and intriguing, is its spotless script. There is no way one can afford to miss this roller coaster of egoistical emotions. It is one of the most exquisite and flamboyant movie i have came across. Everything about this movie just sets the stage for a detailed viewing of human nature. It curtain up the adherence to ""our way"" rather than the ""right way"" for us.

We are drawn toward the values attach to us, the conditions those make us go through what changed our opinions now and in a most descriptive way, movie depicts the way ego or stubbornness obstruct the rationality of a being. Another prospect of the movie is standing of one against many. As described in the movie, it is rather tough for a person to contradict the majority and this view is brilliantly showed in this movie. Its not just the crusade for human emotions but a very well staged drama for showing how people react to poverty struck people and how the prejudices about the way they put up to fixate. The simplicity and the blend of some extraordinary performances is something that movies need this movie had the backbone of. Every actor deserves a bow and the stage set for the actors, milieu for the stage is what draws you to at its best. The prevailing conditions, the personal space for every one in the jury room, everything about this movie leaves you with a tremendous interest.

The script and the theme leaves with a great impact, and that is why you cannot afford to lose this one.",10
8 October 2019,That Was UNBELIEVABLE,"I'm just seeing this movie in 2019 but it's passionate and full of stressful situation that you can feel and still needs to support them, whatever their opinion is. JUST lookout the Cover of Movie. It's amazing at all and i haven't no Reason to rate lower 10 BUT We hear anyone has a suggestion or opinion about This Super-Movie like it did!

8 September 2013,Lumet Often Overlooked,"There's a lot of great performances in this classic, but you don't often hear about the flawless direction by Sidney Lumet. With only two sets, the jury room and the washroom, Lumet's camera always seems to be in the right place, and the small shifts and movements let the viewer feel as if they're the thirteenth member watching the truth unfold in front of them. Bravo.

One can only wonder what kind of control Lumet was able to exercise with this formidable cast. Fonda is his usually restrained self, but Cobb, who usually shouts in every role I can remember, has a genuine humanity that deepens with the unfolding of the story. I have to be honest, he's not my favorite of the era, but this role really redeems him in, my eyes. All the others put in solid performances (you'll see a lot of familiar faces if you watched any 60's TV). I particularly like Jack Klugman and EG Marshall, even if their roles seem a bit reminiscent to future or past performances.

All in all an enduring film which actually offers something new with every viewing. Isn't that what we all look for in a ""classic""?",9

18 December 2016,excellent,"The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.

Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.",9
31 October 2016,A Film with Suspense with insights to negotiation strategies,"12 Angry Men is a film concerning the jury of a homicide trial - a young man accused of murdering his father in a fit of anger, and the jury is tasked to determine the accused guilt or innocence. The film creates a great deal of suspense as new possibilities of what might have happened during the night of question are revealed. Moreover, heated conflicts and conflict of interests amongst the jurors allows viewers to lean more about the personalities of each juror. This film forms a great example to discuss negotiation strategies, as it greatly resonates with negotiation in real life (a long winding process), and why there's an art to it. Thou the purpose of the film is not meant to determine what precisely happened on the night in question, I felt a tinge of disappointment with the various possibilities in my head. Nevertheless, that's the beauty of the film and 12 Angry Men stands the test of time / all time classics, despite it being a black and white film.

11 November 2016,12 Angry Man Review,"""12 Angry Men"" depicts a negotiation among a jury in the 1950s in the United States. The negotiation is regarding a patricide case where the defendant will be issued the death penalty if found guilty. The play revolves around the opinions, perceptions, reason and logic of twelve different characters that are tasked with pronouncing the guilt or innocence of a 16-year-old boy accused of patricide. In his closing statement, the judge instructed the jury that a ""guilty"" verdict can only be delivered in the absence of a reasonable doubt and they had to arrive at a unanimous decision before they could present the verdict to him.

Some of the notable interests identified in the course of negotiations came from Jurors #3, #7 and #10. After the jury was tied at six to six, Juror #8 brings up the the testimony of the arresting police officer and Juror #5 contests the claim that the defendant had the competency to inflict the chest wound on the deceased. As the discussion went on, Juror #7 decided to change his vote to ""break it up"" and swing it to 7 to 5 in favour of ""not guilty"" because he got jaded and was more interested in attending a baseball game in which he had tickets for. Therefore, his interest was for negotiations to end quickly. Juror #10 despised people from the slums and his attitude suggested that the defendant probably deserved the death penalty. Clouded by his prejudice against the defendant, he completely disregarded the notion of justice. In his final monologue when the jury was 11 to 1 in favour of ""not guilty"", we observe that Juror #3 was the last to ""break"". This happened only after his emotional outbursts of anger was shown from the broken relationship and hurt he felt from his own son. Therefore, his interests showed that he was confused about his position as to whether the boy deserved the death penalty as he made a call based on the personal hurt that he had experienced.

In conclusion, 12 Angry Men is a classic movie which proves why the American trial-by-jury system is effective in helping the judge mete out a verdict. It showcases the great diversity in America and the several challenges it produces. Fisher also points out the importance of having various experts and professions' perspectives and opinions which will help to examine the problem.",8

16 November 2016,"Excellent and suspenseful, with a great plot!","This movie turned out to be way better than expected, and shows that you do need a huge budget or tons of special effects to make a good film.

The film begins at the end of the trial, and the 12 jurors are given the responsibility to come to a unanimous decision on whether the boy is guilty of murder. However, the court case just sets the context. The highlight of this film is the negotiation process.

Each of the characters are well-developed, with their individual personalities and backgrounds. Initially, the vote was 11:1 in favour of guilty and the audience can feel the discomfort of juror #8 who voted otherwise. The tension in the room grows as emotions escalate and things get heated up. Each juror has their own prejudices and interests, and these are revealed as the deliberation goes on.

The interaction between the jurors, as well as how juror #8 skillfully influences his other jurors to reconsider their previous positions, gives us some insights on what affects our decisions as well as some tips on effective negotiation.

The excellent dialogue and cast kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. I would definitely watch this again.",9
6 March 2023,The Best!,"""12 Angry Men"" is a classic American drama film released in 1957, directed by Sidney Lumet, and starring Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Martin Balsam. The film is based on a play by Reginald Rose.

The story revolves around a group of 12 jurors who are tasked with deciding the guilt or innocence of a young man who is accused of murdering his father. The jurors must come to a unanimous decision, but one of them, played by Henry Fonda, has doubts about the boy's guilt and begins to convince the other jurors to reconsider their verdict.

As the deliberations continue, the jurors are forced to confront their own prejudices and biases, and the tension between them grows as they struggle to reach a decision. Ultimately, through intense discussion and debate, they are able to reach a verdict that is both just and fair.

""12 Angry Men"" is widely regarded as a masterpiece of American cinema and is often praised for its powerful performances, taut direction, and insightful exploration of justice, prejudice, and the human condition.",10

30 March 2019,Perfect in every way possible,"This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action. Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound. Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily. But if I have to sum up this movie it would be something like this: This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect.

A classical film on the flawed nature of the judicial system, it is a defining example that illustrates the intricacies of negotiation and persuasion. It dissects how different perceptions of justice paired with diversity complicates and impedes the effective negotiation of an impartial outcome.

30 July 2023,"A cult classic on ""Courtroom Dramas""","Arguably the best courtroom drama, played out completely inside of a Jury room, while the jury tries to deliberate a verdict. Can one juror stand up against the ridicule of 11 of his peers and persuade and swing them to pass a verdict of not guilty?

I have seen this movie many times, and for each run, I watch it with the same enthusiasm and verve. One of the best performances of Henry Fonda's career, playing the role of the lone ranger. Lee J. Cobb was equally effective as the 'self appointed public avenger'. And Sidney Lumet brought it all together in a rather special way, thus giving us this wonderful ""gem"".

24 March 2017,"The film ""12 Angry Men"" illuminates the jury's deliberations in a murder trial against an eighteen-year-old teenager who was accused of killing his father.","The film portrayed the difficulty in getting all twelve jurors, with diverse social backgrounds and vastly different personalities, to reach an eventual unanimous agreement of 'not guilty'. It explores the psychological dynamics and interplay of the twelve jurors as they decide the fate of the accused teenager, where a guilty verdict means an irreversible death sentence. The cooperativeness between different groups of people is key to an effective communication. The best possible solution is often the result of the appropriation of different perspectives rather than protecting one. Acknowledging how an individual's perception might be influenced by prejudice, pressures of the majority and various vested interests, we should avoid cementing ourselves in a position that is resistant to change. Hearing from others is no less important than justifying our stand in any issue. Hence, the challenge here lies in how we are able to integrate diverse perspectives into effective and cooperative communities.

A film that takes on various twists and turns. Various learning points can be gleaned from the different personas represented. Highly recommended for people who are interested in learning the way of an effective communication through principled negotiation.",8
14 May 2018,A must watch film for entrepreneurs and leaders,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

24 March 2017,A gripping movie!,"Set entirely within the four walls of a New York jury room, 12 Angry Men has been considered by many as a film that critiques the American judicial system in that era and one that portrays effective negotiation techniques as well. As a whole, 12 Angry Men is a movie that truly highlights the complex nature of negotiations and the level of emotions that can be seen through the process through a gripping story line that captivates and plays on the audience's emotions along the way.

25 March 2017,Importance of Applying Negotiation Skills,"This movie shows twelve men, serving as a panel of juror on a case of a boy charged with murder of his father. The twelve men had to make an unanimous decision by voting to decide the verdict of the 10-year old boy. 11 out of 12 voted that the accused was guilty but Juror 8 voted otherwise.

The vote by Juror 8 stirred unhappiness among others as he was the only one who voted the accused not guilty. When pursued by others to explain his choice, he strongly believed that the boy might be innocent and should be given the benefit of doubt. The life of the boy lies in the hands of the 12 jurors and it should not be taken too lightly. Juror 8 felt and wanted to have a discussion over the case and to reconsider the evidence presented in court.

Through several discussions using principled negotiations, and proving that the evidence were flawed, Juror 8 managed to turn the table and convince all the other jurors to vote otherwise - accused voted not guilty of the murder. He felt that there was reasonable doubt not to convict the boy guilty and his determination had served to prove that it is important to separate the people from the problems by eliminating emotions. Throughout the movie, there were several quarrels and exchange of words during the discussions but Juror 8 kept his mind cool and stayed calm, handling the situation well by not letting other jurors to put him down.",8

4 April 2017,2 jurors gather in a courtroom to decide if an 18-year-old boy is guilty or innocent of stabbing his father to death,"12 Angry Men beautifully exemplifies the art of negotiation. In this movie, 12 jurors gather in a courtroom to decide if an 18-year-old boy is guilty or innocent of stabbing his father to death. While eleven of the jurors initially concurred that he was guilty, Juror 8 maintains his stand that there is reasonable doubt surrounding the whole case. Subsequently, in the main plot of the movie, Juror 8 masterfully demonstrates the art of negotiation by convincing the other jurors - some of whom are hot-headed and impatient - how it would be inaccurate to simply conclude that the boy is guilty.

Could there be more action packed scenes? Sure.

But we're talking about Hollywood's golden era. Anything at the top of its class is worth mentioning throughout history.

The reason I always go back to this film is it's universal appeal. It's filled to the brim with exactly what you want in a good story - rich dialogue, nuanced characters, explosive conflicts, a clear plot with detailed complexities throughout.

It all comes down to the story - a universal and beautiful tale all told in the confines of one tiny room. If you are a fan of storytelling you owe it to yourself to watch this film.

10 April 2019,Masterpiece by all standards,"The prerequisite for a death sentence is an unanimous decision of the jurors: guilty/ not guilty. Here, we see an extraordinary proof of the fact how much stronger the good is than the evil. The actors play their roles very well indeed. The (verbal) struggle lasts an hour and a half - of each individual against himself or against all others. In the beginnig there is only one man advocating reasonable doubt. And that one as a broom sweeps away the compulsive ""opinions"" of his - at first, antagonistic - co-speakers. He doesn't encroach upon anybody else's truth, nor does he try to manipulate them, and yet... He smoothly leads the other members of the jury to a path of consideration and reflection, where they come to new findings by themselves. I experience the end of the film as a phenomenal display of a redemption/atonement, of restoring a peace with oneself - moment when a man becomes aware of his own dark side, finally accepting it. The two diametrally opposed roles are symbolically presented as if they were father and son, who finally surmount all distances in order to come nearer to one another in the end. Out of the unexplored depths a hatred towards the ones who think differently evaporates, spreading to this group of people and to people outside this room, very much the same as the steam evaporates from the depths of thermal springs. Who is better, who is good and who is bad? The questions and answers that arise in the Winnetou-movies or in the competitive games also in the modern time. ""He is such..."". We hear one of the jurors when he tries to manipulate the first ""dissident"". ""They're all the same"", he answers. Why didn't he say ""We are""? Well, some of us already know the answer to that, too. Others are surely going to get to it sometime. In short, a film I can only heartily recommend to watch, especially for those who love and cherish creative doubt.",10
3 December 2017,This movie is so perfect.,"Great writing can endure across decades and centuries, reminding us of the profundity of the human condition.

Reginald Rose's ""Twelve Angry Men"" is a perfect case in point: A dozen men sit in a room discussing the pros and cons of the murder case they saw unfold in court over three days.

The play uses a single set, no special or technical effects, and no bells and whistles – just the pure drama of 12 citizens struggling to do what each believes is the right thing.

Such films like this say to me one more time, that you don't need perfect graphic to show something really interesting. There is just a little room, and 12 different characters. And In contrast to modern films, i feel each of them. Here we can see, how actually working our systems. When we have anxious, to say our thoughts. When we don't really think about other people's decision, just judge them, without a doubt. When there are some people, which can just shout, and others change their minds. This is not John Wick. When you want some blood, this is not film for you. I hope you will enjoy too.

If this was was made with the same cast today and in glorious HD.... I'm sure this movie would be sitting pretty on top of the charts by some considerable distance.. The casting is superb, the scene is tense and simple. The story and script is very clever, a brilliant story...It picks on each character in turn and challenges each genuine argument.. I grew up watching Fonda films and this is clearly his best preformace.

I've waited a while to watch this and it hasn't disappointed.. Now sitting pretty as my favourite film..

6 July 2001,I was forced to endure this,"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college. Synopsis: 12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients. I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted. Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best. It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.

I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk. The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'."" The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him. This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.

Henry Fonda defines the difference between ""actors"" and people who work in films. You believe who he is and what he is saying, you are almost there with him.

12 November 2009,A must see movie!!!,"Sadly, I discovered the movie last month. I'm 35, so I watched the movie from an 'adult' point of view. With this background, only one thing can be said:

This movie is really really good!!!!

Some of the reasons are: - Great script (great adaptation from TV) - Great acting (if not the best acting crew I've ever seen) - No flashbacks! - The beauty of simplicity: Just one set in the whole movie, a locked room and its toilet - Thematic: An interesting one... When the reason prevails, good things happen.

Greetings from Spain!

5 October 2017,"Seemed boring at first but i before i knew it, an hour had passed","The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

22 January 2023,"""12 Angry Men: A Film That Inspires Hope and Determination in the Face of Adversity""","""12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you in awe of the power of one person to inspire change and hope in the face of adversity. The film follows a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the fate of a young man accused of murder. The tension and drama are palpable as the jurors struggle to reach a unanimous verdict, with one man (played by Henry Fonda) standing alone in his belief of the defendant's innocence. The film is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even when it may be difficult or unpopular.

As the jurors struggle to come to a unanimous verdict, the audience is taken on a journey of self-discovery as we witness the flaws and biases that exist within all of us. The film expertly explores themes of prejudice, justice, and the power of one person to make a difference.

But what truly sets this film apart is its ability to inspire hope and remind us of the good that exists within humanity. Henry Fonda's portrayal of the lone holdout is a shining example of the power of one person to stand up for what is right and make a difference in the world.

""12 Angry Men"" is not just a film, it is a call to action. It reminds us that we all have the power to change the world, and that the smallest acts of courage and kindness can make a huge impact. This film is a must-see for anyone who wants to be inspired, moved and uplifted by the power of hope, courage and the human spirit.",10

6 November 2017,An unexpectedly enjoyable film that I would highly recommend!,"In Sidney Lumet's film 12 Angry Men, the fate of a teenage boy facing a murder trial lies in the hands of a jury comprising of twelve men from varying backgrounds and different degrees of motivation coming into the court hearing. Some are present merely out of national duty, whereas others, particularly Davis, the only juror who in the beginning voted the accused as not guilty, take their role seriously as a life is at stake. I was initially skeptical about how entertaining this film would be given that it is a black and white film revolving around twelve men in a room discussing a case with no change in setting at all. I was prepared to fall asleep, but boy was I wrong. This film turned out to be one of the most meaningful and engaging film that I have watched, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the negotiation process between members of the jury. I am impressed at how the producer was able to raise certain issues about the jury system like prejudice and personal bias subtly in the film, and the film brought out raw emotions like frustration and anger which are realistic emotions that jurors might feel when in the back and forth process of negotiating. The film shows the importance of objective and rational decision- making especially in the context of determining the outcome of a sentencing, at the same time not neglecting the complexity of negotiation due to differing interests that parties involved hold. I would highly recommend this film to my friends and would gladly watch it again.",9

13 March 1999,"Defines the word ""classic""","My definition of a classic is anything that stands the test of time. Whenever it is measured against the yardstick of greatness, it always measures near the top. 12 Angry Men is a classic in cinema, but really stands out in my mind as an acting standard; something you measure all other efforts against. We watch the full spectrum of possible emotion evolve in these gentlemen throughout the 90 minutes we're given. I believe the only special effect was the sound of rain. Watching the talent saddens me a little as I realize the number of these fine actors no longer with us. Measuring this group against any other and my opinion is you will not find it near the top of greatness; but at it's pinnacle. To those that made this movie possible I'd like to thank you for the timeless gift.

31 October 1999,Ultimately the film is a marvel to watch and to appreciate,"The premise of setting a film in one room for 90 minutes during a trial on the hottest day in New York. Is an incredible challenge to any scriptwriter and director Potentially a disaster waiting to happen. Lumet's direction and Rose's script give the film an atmosphere which drips with sweat and tension. Boris Kaufman's camera work, forever up front and direct with his in you face shots gives the film its claustrophobia and tautness

Giving that this is Sydney Lumet's first film, makes the film an even bigger accomplishment. And is the seed from which the majority of his films have explored. All dealing with the law and those that brake it and corrupt it, all delivered in fine taunt thriller form, with which he has become synonymous whether for, Serpico', The Anderson Tapes', Dog Day Afternoon', Q & A' and most recently Night Falls on Manhattan'.

To make it truly captivating which it is, is a bonus especially as we didn't see the crime so even we cannot as the audience make an opinion . We are in the same boat as the jury. The cast is led by Henry Fonda who honestly cannot say the young black is guilty, so the story goes from their. From the script and its tackling of the American law and how on the surface a man may seem guilty, but is innocent until proven guilty. The films genius lies in Rose's script, and its imaginative use of the various members of the jury which fuel the narrative. Then how each member maybe swayed or has certain prejudices which come to light throughout the film. In doing so makes it compelling and a stunning piece of ensemble cast acting if their ever is one. Each have their moment to shine, igniting the story further, giving the film an impetus. Without which the film would have become as static as one would think because of its one location. Ultimately the film is a marvel to watch and to appreciate on every level of film making",

12 November 1999,Incredibly fascinating and a must-see for anyone,"This is one of the best films I have seen in my life. It rests on the merits of its talented script and amazing cast alone, drawing the audience in with every word. The film teaches a valuable lesson about looking beyond what seems obvious, while at the same time captivating our attention. I can't imagine that anyone would not enjoy this movie.

10 November 2017,"An excellent movie, one that has stood triumphantly against the test of time.","The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness.

5 December 1999,One Of The Absolute Greatest Movies Of All Time,"It is hard to imagine how a movie that takes place in one room can be so entertaining. The script, and the excellent acting make this a must see. I have watched this movie over and over and never get tired of seeing it. These twelve men, all from different backgrounds gather to decide the guilt or innocence of a young boy accused of murdering his father. ""On the surface he appears to be guilty"" is quoted by one of the jurrors. Henry Fonda isn't so sure.. the eleven others seem to be sure of his guilt. Throughout the 90 minutes these 'Twelve Angry Men' hash it out. They discuss, argue, fight, and even threaten one another until a verdict is finally reached. This movie is truly a masterpiece. A must see for all movie enthusiasts.

10 November 2017,12 Angry Men,"12 Angry Men is set in a courtroom with twelve jurors who have to decide if the defendant (the boy) is guilty or not for the charge of killing his father. The boy would get the death sentence if the outcome is that he is guilty and the votes by the jurors had to be unanimous before the verdict can be made. The movie started with eleven 'guilty' votes against one 'not guilty' vote by juror 8. In this film, we see how twelve jurors with varying personalities and temperaments, state their ground and convince the rest on the stand that they believe in. This movie brings out the power of negotiation and understanding to achieve a common consensus.

It was a refreshing movie for me as I had never watched such a movie before. The script was very well planned as it really incorporated elements of negotiation worth learning and the execution of negotiation was also nicely done by the cast.

I would recommend watching this movie as it is indeed very different from the movies now. What intrigues me is how a movie can be set in the court room for the full duration of the whole movie.",8

The actors' performances are wonderful, pulling the viewer into the experience. Despite having been made over 40 years ago, the performances, feelings and issues discussed are as relevant today as in 1957.

If you can't go out to see a play, stay in and watch ""Twelve Angry Men.""

4 December 2000,Effective twist on typical court room dankness.,"When we think of when a movie is set in a courthouse it is either A Few Good Men or the latest John Grisham movie via book. 12 angry men is set in the deliberations room after a trial has taken place and focuses on what matters. The 12 men who will decide this boy's fate. All but one is ready to convict, reasons ranging from their own child's disobedience to wanting to catch a baseball game. This movie is very effective at creating memorable characters. Having seen this movie several years ago and just recently reviewing it, I could distinctly remember all 12 jurors and their personalities. One can't help, after viewing the film, at how original and brilliant it was for its time. More recent courtroom dramas are all about an obvious unfair trial as in a black man on trial for something NO jury would convict him for outside the Deep South. This movie has one main set, which is the deliberations room and rarely strays from it. The long shots of what seems like 5 or 6 minutes happen regularly in the movie giving you the feeling that you are there. What draws me to this movie is that it is about fact and remaining objective. It doesn't have anything to do with prejudice on account of ethnicity, creed, or color. It deals with a child and whether or not he should be put to death. Movies don't need a big budget, fancy sets, or Will Smith to be great. Clever dialog and memorable characters work much better.",

We must admire the audacity of the director who made the movie as it's in one jury room and doesn't show much anything else, but still keeps the views at the edge of his seat. It is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. Kudos to the whole team. I would rate this move 9.0/10.

15 April 2018,OMG I LOVE THIS FILM SO MUCH! ***K YEAH!!!,"I remember watching this movie on one my last lessons in Legal Studies in Australia because there's not much else to do besides the exam prep. I don't understand the appeal of this movie at all. All it is revolves around twelve angry men yelling at each other for the entire movie, in one room. Sure, it tells the story (and I'm seriously stretching the term for this particular live action reel) of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. This works well as a play and I like the acting and dialogue in this, but does not translate well onto movie at all. That's what Parliament Question Time TV show is there for. This movie is so boring, forgettable and torturous that this is the third time I literally fell asleep a half hour in besides Transformers: Age of Extinction and the new version of Independence Day. Because movies are meant to entertain people, even Tommy Wisseau's The Room and the animated Titanic movies are watchable compared to this torture device. This movie is generally studied in English (lucky I never had to do that, even though there was no way I could escape seeing this movie), and I feel for the high school students who have to watch this for study, and fans of this movie who would throw their money at everything they see.",1
21 July 2001,Excellent,"5 stars no two ways about it. One of the best movie I have ever seen. Who would have thought of a script/story in a single room in 1957. The potrayals by each and every individual is good. the characters have really come out well.

I've seen both versions, they are both great, but his one, the original one, is the much better one.

They don't make many movies like this anymore, and i wish they did.

Fonda is excellent, in fact all actors are excellent, you don't feel the acting, but you feel the emtions and thinking, and hardship they have to go through.....

30 August 2003,Somewhat Overrated,"Twelve Angry Men is a good film, but not deserving of it's high IMDB ranking, in my opinion.

It is a compelling film, and viewers will definitely want to stay until the end, and the performances and direction are generally fine, however:

1. As others have mentioned, it is a simple film, and predictable - perhaps I'm expecting too much from a film made in 1957, but I think not - of course these flaws are due to the story and the script.

2. I'm probably all alone on this one, but I find Cobb's performance to be way over the top - the quintessential example of a great stage actor overplaying a role on the screen.

3. It has repeatedly been mentioned that this film may be the best example of an ensemble cast and group dynamics - I believe Glengarry Glen Ross and many other films dwarf 12 Angry Men in the ensemble category, and Glengarry in the group dynamics category, though I realize the relationships are different - and GGR isn't even in the top 250! (possibly due to profanity)

To sum it up, seeing 12 Angry Men ranked in the top 30 films makes ME angry .",
19 May 2018,Wow,"I came into this movie expecting a lot from reading reviews and such but it was far better than expected. The tension created just in that jury room was amazing and it is not dependent on all plot and action. Every actor greatly contributed to the entirety and greatness of the movie and that is a sign of a great film. This overall leaves you being satisfied with an unforgettable experience.

14 March 2017,"Good for a one-room movie, but lack of gray characters","I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought the moral of the movie (overcoming prejudice) took precedence over making characters a little more believable. There were a couple characters who clearly were the bad guys from the start and their positions were never justified, just shown to be illogical and they eventually realize it. There was a single character in the movie who felt real to me, with the rest more or less fulfilling a purpose in delivering the message of the movie. It was inspiring to some extent and has some important messages about being able to change your opinions in light of superior information. The low score for me was just the heavy-handed way they delivered these messages with mostly black and white characters.

10 October 2018,The very best acting I've ever seen,"It's hard to believe that twelve men locked in a room talking about a murder case could be any kind of a decent movie. But this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Henry Fonda's performance in this movie is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Twelve men locking in a room discussing a case literally gave me chills and goosebumps throughout most of the movie. My heart stopped and my jaw dropped when Fonda took the knife out of his pocket and stabbed it into the table. This movie is not for everyone. I used to know a guy who said multiple times in the period that I knew him, ""If nothin' blows up, it ain't a movie."" Not everyone is as big of fan of movies as I am, but if you consider yourself a fan of all types of genres and superior acting, then find a way to watch this movie. There is a good reason this movie, (at the time of which I am writing this review,) is in the top five highest rated movies of all time on IMDb.

2 November 2018,A very insightful movie with learning points in negotiation,"Watching the movie, in conjunction with reading the book ""Getting to Yes"" by Roger Fisher, I was pleasantly surprised at how the theories from the book came to ""live"" in the movie. The movie truly showed very strong elements of principled negotiation of the protagonist contrasted against the positional bargaining of the other jurors. The reasons behind the different negotiating style was also well explained and in line with what the book posited, such as positional bargaining, which is a result of not being able to separate people from the problem and neglecting one's interests to focus on the positions instead. Furthermore, interesting negotiation techniques were used by the protagonist to be able to share his opinions effectively and deal with stubborn jurors, which could be an inspiration to how we handle negotiations and conflicts in our lives

5 November 2018,A brilliant film about negotiation and the workings of law,"""12 Angry Men"" is a 1957 American courtroom drama film adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The film describes the story of a 12-men jury in a New York City courthouse deliberating the case of an 18-year-old Hispanic slum-born boy who had allegedly stabbed his father to death. The objective criterion used was reasonable doubt - that is, if the jury had any reasonable doubt as to the culpability of the boy, they were to return a verdict of not guilty. Conversely, if the jury had no reasonable doubt as to how culpable the boy was, they were to return a verdict of guilty, and the boy would be sentenced to death accordingly.

""12 Angry Men"" compellingly explores many powerful techniques of negotiation - that is, how to build consensus amongst a group of people with starkly different personalities and worldviews. ""12 Angry Men"" is an outstanding masterpiece of a film that has withstood the test of time. The film relies less on elaborate special effects and costumes but impresses all the same simply because of the excellent plot and consummate acting.

""12 Angry Men"" is a film highly recommended to people young and old. Because it is a courtroom drama, ""12 Angry Men"" may be especially interesting to law students, lawyers and those interested in the workings of law.",10

It also shows the gross Reality (Prejudice) of our tribalistic Society in that People that grow up in bad and poor Neighbourhood are already concived as bad people just for living their. Nice socially critic movie from the golden Age of Hollywood.

7 March 2023,Very Good Classic Movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9

11 January 2019,The simplicity makes this movie incredible,"I was looking at the Top Rated Movies at IMDB and I felt me interested to watch ""12 Angry Men"" after I read its synopsis, so even though I don't have so much time I decided to watch it, considering that is a short movie. It was one of my best choices, because I've never seen a movie which basically revolves arround a single scenario holding someone so much time. The concept is very simple and the dialogues are as simple as such, but the movie's magic is at the storie's unfolding, showing how a single person can influences other people only using arguments. Finally, for me, it's a fantastic movie and it's obligated for some professionals (e.g. lawyers).

3 June 2023,#1 masterpiece of all time,"I watched this movie seven years ago and I still believe that's best masterpiece of all time

Everything that a movie must have, exists in this movie, camera, dialogues, actors, director, and most important screenplay and ...

I recommend to everyone to see this movie very deeply, because we can learn a lot of cinematic art specially thriller that my favorite movie genre it is.

As latest years movies are not good movies I think people go back and watch old years movies that is great.

Do we need spiderman vs Ant-Man vs butterfly man vs beetle man .... (It lasts forever) in cinema or real good movies that make alive a big feel in us.

Summary making movies are going wrong way specially in Hollywood and best way is watching old movies.",10
10 February 2019,One of the Best,"I was very positively blown away by this movie. I definitely must say that it is one of the best I hae seen. Something that I find very fascinating about it is that it keeps you interested in the story and on the edge of your seat even though it takes place in the same room for the entirety of it and it is just made up of conversation. in that respect it reminds me of ""Rope"" by Alfred Hitchcock, which I think is a masterpiece. The performances are very engaging and I think that all of the characters were portrayd in a very well done and believeable way. Henry Fonda is obviously very good but I was happy that he didn´t steal the show despite being the main character. All of the characters had their time to shine and their own little character arc. Before watching this I wouldnt have thought that a bunch of people arguing could be this entertaining to watch however later on I was legitemately sad to see it end. I belive I could honestly watch this movie for days. It just never gets dull. The mystery aspect of the movie I think was very well handled for the most part. The fact that we do not know any of the evidence before the debate of the twelve jurors was very good because that way there were a lot of awesome scenes where a crucial piece of evidence was presented that turned the argument around. (A good example for this is the scene where Henry Fonda pulls out the knife.) In the end the audience never finds out whether the young man actually comittted the murder or not which seems somwhat dissappointing to me but when thinking about it further I guess that´s the point of the movie. Its not really about whether the boy is guilty or not. It´s just about what you choose to believe.

Overall this movie made for a very entertaining watch and I would recommend this movie to everybody. See it as soon as possible. I really loved it a lot and if it was possibl to give half stars I would give it an 8.5 instead of an 8 to get a more accurate rating. Maybe on a second viewing I´ll give it a 9 but that remains to be seen.

Excellent film.",8

30 October 2022,This is a real deal,"12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how ""truth"" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?

6 October 2006,"One of the Greats, without question......","Considering the age of this film, and that it is filmed mainly in one room, I think it is amazing that it still manages to keep you gripped from start to finish. There are no special effects, no camera trickery, just a solid script expertly deployed by a legendary cast. The fantastic camera angles mean that you almost feel the sweat and the tension even though its in black and white and was made nearly 50 yrs ago!!

My favourite scene is when the men are discussing how rare the murder weapon is by saying, ""a knife like that could only be one of a kind!"".

Then Henry Fonda proceeds to pull an identical knife out of his pocket, flicks the blade out and stabs it into the table!!...

....this film is proof that they don't make 'em like they used to!

18 October 2013,Simple but amazing!,"I'm not a big fan of white & black movies, I don't really know why, so I was a little reluctant to see this movie. A friend of mine kept telling me how great it was so I gave it a chance.

Well, I wasn't disappointed. This movie is amazing! It is a simple movie, no action, no big plot, one place. And because of this it is even better!

Its dialogue is superb, and makes you wandering and question the real motives (of the crime) as the characters do!

You'll never be so much interested in 12 men sitting around a table and discussing something as in this movie!

It is a well executed movie, great acting, and great storyline! I've watched it twice in a row.

Give it a chance as I did, you'll enjoy it for sure!",10
20 March 2021,Suspenseful Perfection,"This film captivated me from the first time I saw it. Compelling and suspenseful it's a study of the time period yet could be applicable today. Appearing to be about a simple case the film explores the power one man has to change the tide of a few to impact group think. Beneath the surface of the film is a labyrinth of deception peeled away layer by layer. Acting fails nowhere, cinematography and direction are flawless. This gem may be over looked for the simple fact that's it's older but don't judge a movie by it's color,

7 November 2022,"An old, misundestood masterpiece","Many times I am surprised to remember the first time I saw this movie, courtesy of one of the best teachers I have ever had, who did us the favor (although most of us were not able to appreciate it at the time) to see this wonderful classic , sometimes forgotten. This film does nothing more than remind us that black and white cinema does not have to be boring, slow or pretentious, but quite the opposite: this film, although it starts quite calm, little by little it catches the reader to the point of making it Better than the tensest of thrillers. It is crowned with some of the top scenes of classic Hollywood (the knife or, without going any further, the final dialogues) that represent a hidden face of the 50s in the United States, reflecting the fragility of the toughest and most severe of the figures from the film, shedding light on the inherent problems that result from generational differences. Without a doubt, a classic to the point of causing envy towards those lucky ones who have not seen it yet. Highly recommended.

16 March 2003,Who needs cash when you've got gold?,"So the day before I watched this for the first time, I had watched Clockstoppers. Diametrically opposed schools of thought here... Clockstoppers had a horrible story and some neat effects--basically they took a crap script and threw a ton of money at it. Ended up with something you could sit through without getting TOO uncomfortable...

12 Angry Men? Golden. You just can't replace an amazingly well written story with effects. This movie is an amazing example of that. This film had me sitting at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next...

With Clockstoppers, I was spending more time figuring out what to watch next.

12 Angry Men? At the end of the film, I was trying to figure out when I could watch it again!

16 February 2007,Outstanding movie,"This movie is outstanding because it is more like reality than a movie. It tells us a poignant story of our prejudices. It has opened my eyes. This movie should be in TOP 5. This movie should be part of out basic education. It should be watched several times. Especially those who deal with legal issues should elaborate this movie's message. I cannot advocate death penalty and I wonder if anyone can after understanding this movie's message. It is a terrible thing that so many non-guilty people are convicted to death. Even today jury's members have prejudices against accused people. Those prejudices usually lead to misuse of justice.

When enough people has seen and understood this movie's message, death penalty will be history and justice will reign.

31 January 2019,Black and White done right,"My headline I used was only because it sounded clever, in fact this movie is everything about film making done right. Back when movies didnt have mind blowing effects and huge budgets, you had to have a story to keep people interested and not only that, but tell the story well. 12 Angry Men in my opinion is some of (if not) the best dialogue driven story telling to ever be put to film. The filmmaking at hand is EXACTLY how it's supposed to be done, the dialogue is engaging, the performances convincing, and tension so thick you can taste it. I came into this movie expecting greatness and got a masterpiece. 10/10

The cinematography the acting, the directing, but especially the dialogue are incredible! You slowly get to see more and more of each man and what they are like as characters. It's done so slowly and smart and it really makes you feel that every single character is different here.

Fonda was the star of the show for me. He gave an incredibly great performance! Overall, this movie is incredible. The run time is perfect and it never overstays it's welcome. I can't wait to watch it again!

27 September 2007,A classic that truly deserves the tag of classic,"After hearing so much about this film, for so many years, i finally got a chance to see it last night.

I don't remember ever being so riveted by a film. The amount of tension that was delivered by just 12 actors in one room for an hour and a half was amazing. I have to admit that I had been disappointed by 'classic' films in the past that just didn't live up to the reputation. This however blew me away and I have watched it again already.

In short, this immediately jumps into my top ten favourite films ever. If you haven't already seen it - PLEASE watch it, you won't be disappointed.

12 March 2023,Masterpiece,"This movie is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking, with flawless execution of every technical aspect from cinematography to sound design. The acting is superb and the story is well-crafted and engaging, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

While I cannot deny the artistic merit of this film, it falls short of a perfect score for me because it lacks a relatable connection to my personal experiences. The characters and themes may be expertly crafted, but they do not resonate with me on a deeply personal level.

Nevertheless, this film is a true masterpiece and a must-see for any lover of cinema. It showcases the heights that the art form can achieve and leaves a lasting impact on its audience, even if it does not strike a personal chord with everyone who watches it.

16 September 2022,12 angry men,"Beautifully created perfect example of less is more. Wonderful courtroom drama that will have you questioning your own morals and thought process. This movie is very straightforward, and does an excellent job of focusing on the story, the characters, and the conflict. A great 1950's film, with wonderful writing, and terrific acting. Everyone should watch this film, especially a student of law or cinema. This film is a cinematic masterpiece that does an excellent job of displaying tension and drawing the audience closer to the edge of their seats. This 1950's gripping drama makes much out of a simple situation and setting.

9 September 2022,Non-Stop Drama From 1st Minute To Last!,"I think everything said about 12 Angry Men has already been said, so I'll make it brief,

This Film is a true masterpiece, it grips you in from the start and leaves you wanting more at the end. The Plot is so simple but probably the best I have ever seen, and it's backed up with even better acting with some 10/10 performances from household names like Henry Fonda. This movie has no violence, no scary scenes and no special effects but it grips you on and sends your heartbeat going up and up and up.

For me this is no debate one of the best movies of all time and a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime. The date might throw a few people off as it came out in 1957 however its a true classic and a incredibly special and memorable movie

Rating: 12 Angry Men/12 Angry Men.",10
11 September 2022,A Stunning Masterpiece,"The best piece of writing I have ever witnessed. The dialogues are sharpened and even if we dont get a long-ass flashback on every caracter, we can understand their personalities and motives through the most smallest things. 12 Angry man is absolutly a must watch for anyone who is intrested on cinematography.

Realistic and effective. Two words that mixed together allow us to describe the beauty of the acting of this magnificent movie.

Even though one-location movies are hard to make without a strong backstory and a solid set of events, 12 Angry Men has mastered this type of movies and gave all the directors that wants to do a similar type of movies a must follow exemple.

And they are forgetting the most importante aspect of a true masterpiece, the compelling storytelling, like this old, but still actual film show us with maestry.

No matter how many years or decades has passed or how many remakes they try to make, this one is atemporial and still reflects the real nature of human prejudice.

I really recommend this awesome movie to Everyone who loves cinema in all its glory! Thanks for your time reading this and may you all have a great day!

28 January 2002,B&W masterpiece,"12 angry men is my all time favourite film ... the basic story evolves around the Jury discussions in a murder case, there are no action scenes, special effects, music score etc ... but its totally engrossing is acted superbly. This is a REAL film with a good plot and clever character development. It shows all sides of human nature, as each character comments on the case and we build up a picture of them and their personal views/feelings. There is hostility, racism, selfishness, anger which is subtlety developed during the film.

The directing is very clever with lighting changes and close-ups of the Jury in the room which add to the tense atmosphere. I like the way Henry Fonda finally sways them all around to his way of thinking, he does take a chance on the first vote - luckily the old man comes to his rescue, the old man helps him again later on by spotting the'glass' marks on the witness, this is key evidence ... In some ways the old man becomes the 'hero' of the film aswell !?

Anyway I don't care what anyone else says, the film stands tall on its own and does not require special effects/action scene frills to make it good. I would rather watch this any day than some blockbuster effects film that lacks a decent storyline but survives on its 'good special effects'.....

This is a real movie ... a gem",10

Set in New York in 1957, this film, even though the script is groundbreaking, could have been a boring piece of cinema if it were not for its director; making his feature film debut, Sidney Lumet shows his expertise in the craft of cinema by maintaining the tension throughout the entire 90 minutes of film -and considering that it all transpires in just one room it makes it even more amazing.

The handling of the camera is superb, it makes you feel you are inside that jury room with the rest of the jurors. The acting is exquisite; Henry Fonda plays the only juror that believes the accused to be innocent while the others try to convince him otherwise. And that is the genius of this film, through those arguments between the jurors we are shown the differences of the characters; the guy from the poor neighborhood, the working man, the rich guy, the old man that nobody pays attention to and so on.

The dialogues have an incredible depth, dealing with issues such as justice and racism in a very subtle way and yet the plot never becomes a boring speech about political correctness. Although the stars of the movie are Henry Fonda (My Darling Clementine, Grapes of Wrath) and Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront, Exodus)- actor gods walking amongst men-, the supporting cast is so well put together that becomes the foundation of ""12 angry men"".

This film It is one of those rare opportunities where the three most important elements of a movie come together. They are, the script, the director and the acting. In this case they combine so perfectly with each other, they bond so well that it is impossible to divide this film into those three elements. You see the movie as a whole, as a well oiled machine where each and every gear contributes to make this classic something to remember.",
16 April 2023,"No hero, no villain, just cinema.","12 Angry Men is a perfect example that you don't need heavy VFX, fancy editing or some huge special effects to make a good movie. All you need to make a good movie is good writing and good acting. 12 Angry Men is one of the most well-written and well-acted movies that I have seen in my life. It truly amazes me that an old movie from the 1950s directly addresses classism, toxic masculinity and other prejudices of society while also indicating different shades of human morality. All 12 characters in the movie exhibit such a vast range of emotions and show us how different human nature can be, from one juror being ignorant who couldn't care less what the outcome is to one juror who declares the accused guilty solely based on his prejudices against the people from slums. Each juror in the movie is also extremely well-written and carries their own back story. We are subtly shown that Juror 3 has had a bitter relationship with his son and one of the jurors who despite being born in slums, grew up to be a successful and well-mannered person against the stereotype. 12 Angry Men is a benchmark to judge how well-written a movie is. Simply a remarkable movie that stood against time and to this day, 67 years after its release, is considered a timeless classic and one of the best movies of all time. It came to me as a surprise that this movie failed to make a profit and also didn't win any Oscars. Nevertheless, cheers to Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda for giving us this magnificent movie, certainly one of my favourites.",
2 November 2022,13th Angry Man,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",8
28 October 2021,A Fine Aged Character-Based Masterpiece,"I had only seen this movie recently, and I was honestly shocked by the brilliance of this piece. It shows how could a decision of one man can give or take a life focusing on the value of human life and how a little good can go a long way. And it's one of the greatest films ever made.. period.

19 November 2022,The timeless classic in search of resolution resolution value!,"One of the greatest classics in the history of cinema, presented in a unique way, In a single room in black and white, the camera presents an epic 96-minute talk film, A discussion about the issue of justice... to highlight, through dialogue, basic concepts about its value.

The dialogue was appropriate for each character according to its structure and distinguished in the scenes of exchanging views between different characters with different social classes and personal natures, which is what made you, as a viewer, interact and believe that such a dialogue can actually happen.

Thank you for reading and I apologize for the long post.

10 August 2023,Best. Court. Movie. Of all time.,"When I was a kid, I thought this movie was nothing more than a typical court drama from the 50's, but it's more than that. This movie not only brings up so many issues regarding upbringing of some children at that time, but it also involves a verbal battle between the 12 jurors whether or not the defendant is guilty or not. Juror 3 became the character I hated most, because of how bitter he was toward the whole situation. But juror 8 became my favourite character from beginning to end, because of the gentleness of Henry Fonda's performance. Each of these characters are unique in their own way.

28 December 2016,must watch for managers,"this movie was shown to us when i was a CIMA student to teach us how managers should tackle a situation when everyone is against him but if he believe in what he does is right then he should stand for it no matter what. this movie is perfect lesson for everyone who is in a position to deal with people or for the one who has to take all the important decisions in his job or in life.So one should not look if all others are against him or he should not fear for standing alone but if he believes in what he think is right then he should try to convince this mates and take a final decision. and the decision should not be taken in a hurry because all the decision are connected to some or the other thing which will eventually affect one or the other. this movie teaches all, must watch.

22 September 2003,A class review,"I am a middle school teacher in California. Aside from some academics, I teach a film class as well. I showed 12 Angry Men to my class and had a surprisingly positive response. The class enjoyed the suspense of the verdict, and were not put off by the lack of loctions in the film. Out of 20 students, only 1 did not care for the movie, and a few gave it a 10 out of 10!

16 July 2002,Greatest movie ever made,"This is my favorite movie of all times. There's so much empathy in Fonda's character. The other characters are also well written. Lumet's other movies isn't even half the movie this masterpiece is, combined. The remake with Jack Lemmon wasn't bad but the original is still better. See it, NOW!

26 September 2002,Not many Directors could pull this off.,"This whole movie was filmed in one room all but 3 minutes. Hitchcock came close on, ""rear window"" but he still had the camera other places (very well done too) but that whole time your so interested in what these guys have to say without any visuals, kind of like if you filmed your grandpa sitting down and telling a story and watching the tape over and over enjoying it more and more. Some scenes they don't stop the camera for about 6-7 minutes and it not just one guy, they go all around to every guy in that room saying different things. In this movie some times you will think he got that guy good, or good point but I wouldn't recommend you to rent this I think it is safe to say buy it. It's an oldie so it's cheaper than your normal DVD or VHS so get it.

26 February 2014,Real masterpiece,"Well, this is my favorite movie ever. When someone asks me about it, I always say that it's about twelve guys sitting in one room and talking, that's all. But what they say and how they say it is so so so awesome. Characters are so clear and distinct that you feel a little in common with every one of them. The story is quite clear - the jury has to make decision if accused man is guilty of murder his father. If yes he get's a death sentence. Case appears to be clear and easy cause' all the evidences and facts are against him. But one of the juries has some doubts. And that's how everything starts. The rest you have to see yourself.

7 January 2003,"""12 Angry Men"" is a major contributor to modern cinema. It is an unpompous masterpiece that will forever stand the test of time.","""12 Angry Men"" is a major contributor to modern cinema. It is an unpompous masterpiece that will forever stand the test of time. Although a scholar of cinematography and a director whose art has spanned 6 decades, Lumet never tries to show off by using unnecessary aesthetic panoramas. Perhaps never better seen that in this classic and again in ""Network"" 20 years later, his dialogues are magnificent. He must go down as perhaps the greatest Director in terms of his ability to draw truly masterful performances from his actors. Cobb, Klugman, Begley Junior, Balsam, Finch, Beatty, perhaps even Holden, Dunnaway and Fonda deliver their finest performances on the silver screen under his direction. Mr. Lumet I take my hat off to you. Were you to combine with, Terence Mallick, and to incorporate his masterful aestheticism, (the ying and the yang), the outcome would doubtless be an unparalleled masterpiece.

20 November 2003,12 Angry Men (1957),"I first saw this movie when I was in my senior US Government class. I had heard of the movie, but didn't realize it was such a great movie. Every character in this movie is very well developed and basically represents a quality of our society. Henry Fonda plays the single man who feels that the boy on trial is not guilty. One by one he attempts to convince the other jurors to change their votes. It is an extremely great movie. I recommend this film to any and everyone who likes movies. Go out now and buy this movie for any price because it is well worth it.

14 October 2015,Great Movie!,"The story is simple, yet compelling. The characters are deep. There was no necessity for special effect or action packed scenes - just plain old portrayal of main protagonists. It simplicity captivates. The main protagonist is torn with feelings. He must decide. The decision is tough, but he fights, and finally - justice wins. Throuout the movie, we see how people are easy persuaded. The movie mainly focuses on the emotions of the mail characters. All we see is 12 jury man in one room. We do, however, see their inner battles and fears. I would also point out the ambient. There was no hi-tech stuff back then. I remember walls. Walls and 12 people. Wonderful story, recommended to all ""static"" film buffs, where only story and inner emotions matter!

7 February 2005,A jury that is on trial itself,"Every member of the jury brings his own prejudices into the jury room. In arguing the merits of the case, they are really discovering things about themselves. We in turn discover things about ourselves as we deliberate along with them.

Shooting in B&W only adds to the gritty feel of this film...the hot summer day...the perspiration soaked shirts (all except E G Marshall) contribute to the sense that there is almost a physical contest going on...

Solid performances by a group of character actors who knew their trade...not like these young ""stars"" of today...

27 October 2013,"A young boy is accused of killing his father, with the evidence against him the case becomes an open and shut one ,but the jury members have another opinion(s)","12 angry men is an instant classic. I watched this movie for the first time in the year 2013, 56 years after its release with my mom and sister and we all loved away. I was blown away with the script's and the directors ability to capture the audience. It seemed as if we all were in the room where those heated jury discussions were going on. The movie is mostly shot in that single room but the audience don't leave the edge of there seats till the end. I honestly don't know how to complement James Fonda who singlehandedly made the movie so interesting. All the actors were at there best and the heated discussions seemed to be so intense and realistic, the movie does stay in your mind for a long time.The movie is something else.It is a classic, and don't be surprised if it becomes your favorite movie after you see it.

8 April 2023,12 Angry Men: An Unforgettable Exploration of Justice and Human Nature,"12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that is worthy of its status as one of the greatest films of all time. The movie is a brilliant exploration of human nature and the complexities of the justice system.

The entire film is set in one room, yet the tension and drama never let up. The story follows twelve jurors as they deliberate the fate of a young man accused of murder. As the deliberations progress, we see the jurors' personalities and biases clash, and their views on justice and the legal system are challenged.

The acting in this film is nothing short of exceptional, with every actor delivering a nuanced and powerful performance. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Juror #8, who stands alone in his belief of the defendant's innocence, is particularly remarkable.

""12 Angry Men"" is a gripping, thought-provoking film that remains just as relevant today as it was when it was first released in 1957. It is a true cinematic masterpiece that deserves a perfect score of 10/10.",10
25 March 2023,Simple and good.,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",8

12 October 2013,Unexpectedly awesome,"12 angry men was always in my watch-list for ages, but I was not certain that I would watch. Mainly because it is being black and white and frankly I have not seen a single black and white Hollywood flick back then.That was god of movies I guess who pushed me to give it a try! Thank you movie god I was lucky enough for witness a such masterpiece.

Almost the entire movie was shot in a single set, always appear a same bunch of guys.Shocking actions,no car chases,blood,chicks,drugs,violence you name anything you would see in a all time favorite flick,but sorry you wouldn't find any single thing in this great flick.Instead of them this movie keeps you at the edge of the chair with only its well-crafted, truly talented way of writing. It never let your eyes take away from the screen.And after the end of the movie you are still in the jury room with those 12 angry men, will-always-stay-in-your-heart kind of movie.

5 March 2015,decision,"a boy can killer, maybe he can burglar. but if he is not crime you don't say anything. this story about a crime. but at the same time about patient and discrimination. A lot of U.S. movies contains discrimination. I don't understand. why do people make discrimination? this movie taught me how I can decide. I learned a boy quites and waits. a boy never got angry. but adults don't understand and don't listen. if you want to decide about a crime, please listen that man. he will tell something. so, i appreciated all men, 12 men. he decided truth. every time will be man who listens suspect. finally, all men made a good job.

18 February 2021,"Disappointed! Seem a lot like a made up story, not realistic.","By the time the vote is 1 against 11, we know how the movie would end. The boy's not guilty. It's obvious, right? And there's no trick at all. As simple as that. The against one was trying to set out the very simple baits and the others carelessly took these one by one. It's too easy. The other juries looked so dumb. They didn't know anything. They weren't good enough to be. They're not realistic. They were just made up, not even so well. The boy couldn't even remember a thing about the movie he just saw that night. And one of the juries could just say one or two things about the movie he saw 3 days ago.That's not a similar situation. Of course, the boy's not guily. We all know that right at the start of the movie but the other juries had to take like 1 hour. Just disappionted with the very simple plots and the baits he used plus how bad the other juries were.

14 March 2018,Impresionante,"Impresionante obra que narra la historia de doce hombres que forman el jurado de un juicio que acusa a un joven de asesinato.

Cada uno de los personajes constuidos con matices diferentes que hacen plantearse unos a otros la moralidad de mandar a un ser humano a la pena de muerte.

Todos claramente decantados por la culpabilidad del acusado van cambiando progresivamente gracias al raciocinio del presonaje que da vida un magnifico Henry Fonda.

Un aspecto teatral y ambientado en un unico escenario, el peso de la historia recae en los actores y la fuerza de sus personajes. El tacto del director y la forma de contarnos lo que nos muestra hace al espectador participe y miembro del mismisimo jurado.

Sublime actuacion de Lee J. Cobb.

Sin duda la mejor pelicula sobre juicios de la historia.",10
9 February 2014,"The greatest of all time, so far..","This masterpiece is undoubtedly the greatest of all time. Why? Because no other film makes such magnificent use of its script. Each and every line is delivered with pin-point accuracy and brilliance, and is vital in relation to the plot; Whilst modern, Hollywood films incorporate endless and unimaginative amounts of filler, such as unnecessary action sequences, exotic locations, sex scenes and forced extra camera shots to add to the movie's runtime, 12 Angry Men proves that filmmaking can truly come inches from faultless and quintessential excellence.

Never has a film so successfully captured an audience's love and attention through nothing but 12 outstanding and charismatic actors sharing one room for an hour and a half. In fact, the only reason why I felt this beautifully crafted movie deserved 9/10 instead of full marks was that I have to believe that there is still room for improvement, and I hope for humanity's sake that perhaps one day, a film may arise which deserves to be considered filmmaking perfection.",10

9 September 2013,Great movie,"Great movie, one of the best. When I first heard about this movie I thought its gonna be some boring old movie, but when I watched I was mind blown.

It really gets you thinking more.

Lumet keeps things tense, sweaty, suspenseful and entertaining despite the contrived story line.

The acting was great, its sad that all of the 12 angry men are dead now.

I would recommend it to everyone, but don't watch the new version, watch the original.

4 September 2013,A Masterpiece With Henry Fonda At His Best,"This movie made me feel that I actually took a part in it! Especially Fonda's character was so realistic I could nearly smell him! At some points I felt like Juror 8 (Fonda) were reading my mind and speaks my ideas out. His character made me feel that every single person's ideas actually matter as individuals. I almost believed, it was Henry Fonda himself, defended that young man, without knowing that he is innocent for certain. Yes indeed, there mustn't be even a little bit of an uncertainty when it comes to execution of a person. An honest man with doubts would defend him at all costs. And I saw an honest man when I looked Fonda's(Juror #8) eyes. So that I wish there was a Juror #13, who could have been me and supporting Fonda in this discussion where he argued against 11 another jurors all by himself. A great script, with Fonda and 11 other great actors; eventually has become a masterpiece.

19 January 2022,So-so,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.

As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio.",4
6 July 2002,"Tony, Tony...","The way the plot develops in this movie is great. Of course it's pretty brilliant to make an interesting movie in just one room. (By the way, see The Cube if you like that concept.) But especially Tony Danza plays a character that is too exaggerated. It's the most annoying person of the twelve and for me that really kind of spoiled the whole thing.

14 February 2023,Excellent,"Excellent acting, excellent direction, everything is perfect. A simple idea was made in such a way that if it continued for another two hours, it would not be boring and every minute was attractive and beautiful. It was undoubtedly one of the best movies that I have seen in my life. Even though almost the entire time of the movie was spent in one room, it was made in such a precise and beautiful way that it was not boring and monotonous at all. The characterizations were excellent. In this movie, all the points and questions that arise in the viewer's mind are answered and nothing is left unclear. The emotions on the faces of the actors are incredibly penetrating and transparent, with a perfect ending.

15 October 2004,best film ever made,"I've just joined the movie database and i thought i must comment on what i think is one of the best films ever made.The way the film starts with the kid that is on trial,and the whole film set in the jury room,absolutely gripping stuff,its what film making is all about,the way that Fonda gets them to all turn their Guilty votes to Not Guilty is just superb.All the actors play a 1st class role.Its difficult to say which one stands out,but i am sure everyone has their favorite,for me it has to be Lee J Cobb,all i can say ""fantastic"". I hope my comments have given some insight to this film and its a must see for all film buffs.

28 August 2023,How can a film shot in one room make you give it the full mark?,"How is it possible for me to make a movie that was all filmed in one room, with varying and escalating dialogues, to make you give it the full mark? It is really one of the best films that many of them are no longer watched now. It is a lesson in directing. And the stupid scenario

And one of the things that made me follow this movie is that it topped the list of the best films, and I was wondering if it was worth all this with this unusual idea. Yes, at the time, I never realized how amazing this unique work was . Especially how only one person was able to convince 11 other men that an innocent child could be executed and he did nothing. It's really an interesting topic.

10 August 2023,Thank you,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life.

I watched in the last week 9 times.

The best thing about the movie was that it was a new story of its kind.

Thank you to all the people and actors who contributed to the making of this iconic movie, which will go down in history, especially the director who played the big role.

But in several remarks, such as there are many scenes that were invaded by silence, and also there is a scene that I did not like when the old man was sitting talking and some men did not respect him. It was an inappropriate scene in a movie like this.

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to making this cinematic icon🙏🙏🙏.",9
23 May 2023,Educational and Ahead of its Time,"I recently watched this movie for the first time due to its high ratings and recommendations and it did not disappoint.

The simplicity of the filmmaking and the complexity of the topics was perfectly balanced and left me feeling educated and inspired.

We live in a movie-making world that over saturated the viewers with CGI and campy dialogue. If you're looking for a pallet reset within film, this is a great place to start. The dialogue feels real, there are no gimmicks and the evocative nature of the concept draws a viewer in feeling like you're part of the 12 Angry Men.

I almost gave this a 9/10, only because there was not much of an ending with a bow on top, but the amount of times I've thought about this film since seeing it, is 10/10!

1 June 2023,A Riveting Exploration of Justice and Humanity,"This film undoubtedly deserves a great place in a potential top! Truly exceptional acting.

""12 Angry Men"" excels in its exploration of prejudice and the power of individual voices. It delves into the inner workings of the human mind, exposing the flaws in our judgment and the influence of personal experiences on our decision-making. Through heated discussions and intense confrontations, the film challenges us to question our own biases and preconceived notions, encouraging a deeper understanding of the complexity of human behavior.

In summary, this film's place among the greatest is well-deserved. Its flawless execution and attention to detail make it difficult to fully appreciate the individual brilliance within.

25 July 2023,awesome,"Quality of your paper depends on the level of organization you implement. Never underestimate the importance of well-structured outline, regardless of the type of paper you have to write. Outlines help you focus on the subject and contribute to a logical flow.

In addition, getting things organized before you start writing is a great way to save time later on. Instead of trying to figure out what to include, you'll have a well-structured plan to follow. It's needless to mention you won't be too stressed out. Here's how to organize your movie review:

Introduction (with title, release date, background information) Summary of the story Analysis of the plot elements (rising action, climax) Creative elements (dialogues, characters, use of colors, camera techniques, mood, tone, symbols, costumes or anything that contributes or takes away from the overall plot) Opinion (supported with examples and facts from the story) Conclusion (announcing whether the filmmaker was successful in his/her purpose, re-state your evidence, explain how the motion picture was helpful for providing a deeper understand of course topic)",10

28 July 2005,A True Classic,"This is a classic 1957 black-and-white movie, directed by Sidney Lumet, produced by Henry Fonda. Henry Fonda is also the lead star in the movie, playing the character of Mr. Davis who is one of the jurors.

The movie shows how a person can keep a cool level head and still manage to convince even the toughest of people about something that is right.

The movie also is intense in the fact that Mr. Davis manages to break the prejudice of 2 of the jurors. One of them was heavily prejudiced against slum-dwellers and feels the boy is ""automatically guilty"" since he is a slum-dweller and so according to him violence runs in his blood. Another juror is heavily prejudiced against unfaithful kids, because his own kid had deserted him and run away from home about 2 years back.

A classic must-watch movie. There are many things that we can learn from this movie. The moral of the story is in a way to be simple, cool, sensible and level-headed.

An interesting fact is that of the entire 94 minutes of the movie, 91 minutes are filmed completely in the juror's room and only 3 minutes are filmed away from the room.

A pleasant change from modern day Hollywood movies,which seem to be overtly obsessed with intense computer generated graphics, loud background music, things blowing up everywhere on the screen, aggressive angry characters, etc.

In ""12 Angry Men"", there's no overt aggression, no fight scenes, no fancy graphics, nothing. It just displays sheer amazing individual acting talents by all the actors.

A must watch and a definitely recommended movie for your private collection.

Enjoy!",10

23 August 2013,Probably the most timeless movie ever made about negotiations.,"12 Angry Men is probably the best and most timeless movies ever made about negotiations, negotiating conflict and standing up for a personal belief. In today's world of nanosecond attention and immediate judgment and decision making 12 Angry Men is a powerful reminder to follow personal instinct, gut feeling, and sound, calm reasoning to come to a fair conclusion. As high profile trials are becoming more and more a TV prime-time event, especially in the United States, everyone who is following it wants to get an answer to the question ""did he/she do it?"". As only fragments of the information are available to TV audiences so it seems that the jurors in 12 Angry Men are only presented information that is easily interpretable from two completely different, opposing angles. The amazing use of stylistic devices builds and reinforces the tension among the jurors from the first to the last minute. The film is truly a timeless classic that is a must watch for virtually anyone.

14 November 2013,Superb Movie,"I am studying this at the moment, and it is the first play/movie that I have thoroughly enjoyed at school. We watched the movie before reading the book, and I thought it would totally ruin my understanding of the book. However, much to my disbelief: it helped me understand the book more. This movie is practically word for word of the play, and every action is demonstrated. *This movie works magic*. It managed to get my whole class (17 year olds)to be interested in a black and white movie. NOT many movies can do that.

The movie doesn't have much going for it: Shot in a jury room (the whole film), black and white, and not much of a story line (at first glimpse). However, some way or another it manages to make the audience feel worried and suspenseful at the end of the movie? I think it is the development of each and every one of the characters, and the numerous lessons to be learned. I will remember this movie for the rest of my life.

*For anyone reading this review: Watch this movie, you will NOT look back*.",10
9 June 2015,One of the best movies ever,"What a movie! The acting was great and they had a good cast. Id have to say that my favorite was Fonda. I were very excited when I saw it juror were fighting about the crime and who did it, I really loved how they thinking intelligent dialog, and not much physical moment feeling It didn't need big expensive scenes or computerized takes This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. You can watch this movie whenever you want because you never bored and you can't take your eyes from the screen. I recommend this movie to all my friends seriously it is one of the best movies I've ever seen

13 February 2023,An amazing masterpiece,"This movie is just incredible...a true masterpiece!

I really recommended.i think it is Unique

The storyline was great and i am sure non of the new movies could be replaced by this.

Also the acting of acters were unblievable.

Although it was recorded in one scene, but the power of the movie makes you want to watch it until the end.

If i write more its would be spoiled so as a classic movie it is highly recommended i bet by watching it you wont loose anything.

(definitely this is my favorite movie of all the time.thanks to everyone that helped to make this . Specially the director ! Thanks a lot )",9

16 April 2015,Recommended for everyone!,"Mostly people like to hear what they actually want and it's always difficult to look at other's perspective and is also very hard to oblige what other's intentions are , so this movie 12 angry men is a good dose to ponder into the reality of critical thinking or may be a wider approach for reasoning or justifying.

All 12 men selected as a jury in this movie fall from different backgrounds with their own busy lives. So they are busy with their own problems and want to finish the task assigned to them in quick matter of time without having a proper judgment, but what's waiting is a deeper darker secret to unfold slowly.

2 March 2023,"All time favourite, great cinematography and story","12 Angry men is a classic with beautiful black and white film. The film has great use of blocking when squeezing 12 men in one room. The cinematography is also exceptional taking into account that majority of the movie plays out within one room. Even though most of the movie takes place in one room, there are a vast variety of scenes scaling greatly in emotion. I really enjoyed how each character in the movie was faced with a moral dilemma they had to face and overcome. The main character proves to have a keen eye, observing many situations uniquely, close and taking in all factors when a life of another man is in question. The banter and conversations amongst the characters flowed much more naturally compared to modern film.

31 August 2013,Simply one of the finest movies ever made !,"It is an understatement to say that it is a great movie. The plot and the story takes the cake. There are no expensive cars, big houses, and stuff on display, but whats needed in the film are right there in place - The actors.

Watching it in 2013, where we have multi continent shooting and heavy expenditure incurred on accessories of fake illusions of characters, this film has been shot in almost the same room where the jury members decide the fate of an accused. The 96 minutes that you spend watching the film will definitely change the way you think (If you do think that way).

A simple yet very effective story that runs like a knife in butter, smooth as silk and crisp as a nut. It is must watch for all and sundry. To sum it up, it is one of those movies that you will not only enjoy watching, but enjoy recommending as well :)

21 January 2005,required viewing,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

10 February 2018,Very interesting and mind capturing movie,"I found the movie to be very unique in a way, it shows how easily ideas and decisions can be manipulated. How personal feelings and experiences blinds us from choosing our most important decisions with integrity and clearness. The actors did an amazing job convincing the viewers, and the story was really captivating from start to finish.

12 February 2005,Great acting and the interactions of great actors.,"It has been said that an actor's performance can be elevated by the presence of a great actor. The greatness of 12 Angry Men somewhere lays in this theory, times twelve. I would be at a loss to identify who is elevating whom, certainly Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and Ed Beagly Sr. are among the truly greats, to single them out as the pacesetters might minimize the skills and abilities of journeymen like E.G Marshall, Jack Klugmen, Martin Balsom or Jack Warden. Obviously John Fiedler or Robert Webber are not names usually associated with the aforementioned and possibly the proof of this theory however I am reticent to apply this to them, so perfect were they in their individual numeric places.

What movie aficionado can remove from memory the old man's affinity and identification with the stroke victim witness ""I believe I know this man better than any of you"", his unexpected gesture of support for the Fonda character with his ""not guilty"" verdict and subsequent explanation as to why. E.G. Marshall's perspiration as he tries to remember a second feature. The broken and silent bigot (Ed Beagly) sitting slumped over and alone. Everything Lee J. Cobb said or did: Knife in hand directed at Fonda's heart, held back by a man who is basically good but threatening still by a lifetime of mistakes and disappointments.

Ninety six continuous minutes of this, one moment no greater, no lesser than the other. No actor's performance eclipsing another's. The director's skillful climactic, anticlimactic meeting on the steps of the courthouse between Davis and McCartel. My apologies to the director, writers and editors, but this movie was made great by the acting. It will never be better than in 12 Angry Men.",10

16 January 2014,A Movie that makes me want to watch B/W Cinema again,"Breathtaking movie,excellent settings and an amazing plot,way ahead of its time. I am a normal movie watcher,in no way a critic and easy on my reviews but 12 angry men would rate in my top 5 any day.This movie appeals to both the youth and the aged alike.Making the movie in essentially one(two if you count the courtroom)setting takes a great vision behind it and I must say the crew and the cast does an exceptional job. Every juror plays his role well and the way the story proceeds at a brisk yet calm rate is good to see.Some of the scenes in the movie are what directors these days take inspiration from.

If you are thinking of exploring old cinema and are(like me)just the fan of blockbuster cheesy movies,check this one out since it is sure to surprise you.

25 January 2014,A great movie for newbie jury duty citizens,"12 Angry Men: I liked this movie because it was shot in a 2 month period - one set - and everybody was on set at the same time... very real, very rare these days. Henry Fonda produced it with his own dime - Again very rare - All the actors seemed extremely real and unforgiving. The actors ability to hold the passion and hope of the jury's outcome keeps the viewer completely involved. The film shows prejudice in many forms, like having a kid of your own you don't like, or color, race, age, financial status, local/foreign connections, how people see from a distance with poor eye site, but hear what they want to. Great cast and simple photography puts this film in my top 100.

27 March 2005,a film that changes the world,"i would imagine that most intelligent people who have seen this film will think back to the theme of it when performing jury duty. Its impact therefore in getting people to scrutinise and question evidence and opinions has had a profound effect upon the judicial system. Fondas performance as well as the brilliant supporting roles played by bigots and indifferent individuals is a wonderful snapshot of actual society. The sauna like conditions in the jury room had one almost perspiring, and the tension and anger portrayed in those scenes has never been bettered by any modern courtroom dramas since. This film should be compulsory viewing for all would be jurors

15 February 2014,Best low-budget movie of all time,"12 Angry men is the best low-budget movie ever. This movie serves as a proof, that to make a great movie, you don't need tens of millions of dollars. The only things you need are: 1 room, 12 actors and a great script. The whole movie takes place in a jury room (2 minutes are at the court of law). That was the reason why I didn't want to watch this movie, but I can tell you, that I've been so wrong. The 12 men are, like at the actual jury, very different, which is one of the main points of this movie. They all need to agree and above all, they have to make the right decision.

The one thing I don't like about this movie is, that it's breathtaking only for the first time. With every view it gets worse and worse (but that might be just fore me).

13 April 2005,character actors,"The story is great, the photography beautiful and the music is perfect, and what a debut for a director! But for me there is more... This film shows how very talented character actors can be. Every single one (especialy Cobb en Warden) are excellent! This is a wonderful and gripping film. Although the remake (with Jack Lemmon) is very good, the characters in the Lumet version are much more lifelike and help to make the story so gripping, funny and poignant. Somehow it is a shame that actors like ""The Immigrant or McCardle"" were not used more often in movies. A virtual masterclass for ensemble acting.

A true movie masterpiece.

22 September 2014,The pinnacle of storytelling,"It explodes right from the get go. Confined in a room , the story unfolds like magic. 12 jurors are given the task to decide on a case involving a young boy stabbing and killing his dad. The jurors are strangers to each other as they are to the audience. The story revolves around how these 12 strangers with completely different backgrounds, experiences and opinions go about the case. Its dialogues and camera angles are masterfully crafted . It is one of those movies , where everything you see on screen pushes the story forward , even something as small as moving a piece of furniture or smoking a cigarette. Filled with ironies and unexpected twists , it would be an understatement to say this movie an intense thriller . A roller coaster ride that will keep you glued to the screens throughout. A Must Watch.

9 October 2015,intact and consistent,"I must say that human's mind is nurtured by dialogue.The consistency of the script is really great. There are an abundance of choices and ways of thinking. I really loved it. The 12 clamber constantly over ideas that came to collapsed in a second.I am awe about the idea of the scenario.It is fragrance by mystery, thrill and drama. We are in front of the bad guy, stupid one, and smart one in a room.We also came into misunderstandings,quarrels and alliances.I really admire Henry Fonda's quantity of style. A great actor who died in 12 August 1982 and above all has starred in the grape of wrath(1940)and Once upon a time in the west (1968).

20 July 2014,An old masterpiece which still holds its own,"Being 15 I've only recently heard of, or had the incentive to go back and watch, some of the older classics and this was first on the list. To make a black and white film based solely in the confines of a small room sporting little more than a table and some chairs is a brave endeavour and this film nails it. It's a great example of how a budget doesn't have to affect a film's quality. As long as the story and the characters are there you can create a sensational film as 12 Angry Men demonstrates. Each of the 12 layered characters is unique which keeps it constantly engaging and the little twists along the way help too. Personally I'm very impressed with the film and hope many others like me can watch and enjoy it as it truly is timeless.

1 January 2015,a great movie.. i enjoyed it.,"12 angry men is a courtroom with 12 men discuss the murder and voting if the defendant is guilty or not. First I forced to watch this film but after a few minutes I start liking it more every passing minutes. It will help me in my presentation ( The mock trail ) so it really helpful if you have a presentation for the mock trail.. me and my classmates enjoyed it and helped them. Mr.King forced us to watch it on purpose, he wants us to know how to discuss an argument or a case. I recommend to anyone has to do a presentation for The mock trail watching this movie. And see how voting is changed from a side to another.

25 March 2015,One of my favourites,"Outstanding movie. I must admit, I'm not one to be attracted by the classics in the pre-80s era. This caught my attention with its limited roster of sets and characters. The simple yet compelling premise provided an instant draw and allowed me to immerse myself in the storyline. Henry Fonda performed brilliantly, with his understated and muted take of the everyday hero. The other characters were also intriguing, and the glimpses of their behaviour within the deliberation process made me want to learn more about them. Great story, script, directing, and acting overall. Definitely on the top of my recommendations.

17 November 2013,Why you should watch this film,"No wonder why this film was picked by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and selected for preservation.

1. It is one of 'The Classics'. It is a film that many people talk about, write about and recommend. Even if you don't like old, black-and-white films, this one should be watched by everyone.

2. It has a significant, well written script. The main mediators for the meaning are words and you need to carefully follow what is going on. It is a trial film, where we observe jury and their deciding about a boy who was accused of a murder of his father. Not so visually refined, the words are important. Dialogue and body language are vivid and most important.

3. Also the character study is one of the greatest and the most detailed. All 12 men from the title are portrayed the best possible way. Actors so in sync with their work that you completely forget you are watching a film and not a live version of a jury. You get lost in the emotions, excitement and quarreling. Each man's personalities are portrayed incredible and their range of personalities adds up to the conflict they have.

4. Main theme is as the title says it all. It is about 12 angry men and how a person is biased by their own emotions and prejudices when he is required to be the most rational, objective and following the facts. As it is important for the juridical system that every detail, every fact must be took into the account before you convict someone, since it is a possibility you could send an innocent person to jail (or even to death). A matter of ethics!

5. Cinematography: sequence shot of the main one-set (jury room), minimalistic Mise-en-scene, because we need to focus on acting and words. Nimble camera movements, key and soft light, close-ups at dramatic shifts, camera moves from above-the-eye to low-angle position and at the end the ceiling is visible and it seems that it is closing the set also as the men are more and more pressured. - Stylised realism.",10

27 February 2016,A positive and normative analysis of a typical jury,"The film is a pure drama and thus the focus is strictly on the content. The Director highlights the following:- 1) Jurors can be pretentious. 2) Selfishness puts duty aside. 3) Testimonies in court can be self made. 4) Testimony should be scientifically authentic. 5)Prejudice contaminates judgment. 6) Pride kills empathy 7) A jury is a sophisticated and complicated body; as strangers from different ideological, social and financial backgrounds have to come to a consensus. 8) Guilty verdict should not be given when there is a reasonable doubt on the authenticity of evidence/testimony against the accused.

1 January 2017,Must see master-peace,"A great movie masterpiece i recommend it. Easy watchable interesting, great script, great acting, balanced, natural flow, good production and management. A lot of good actors that pull the story together. Movie with a strong message and clear idea presented in a fine way. Timeless classic. Fabula flows naturally with a lot of slow going twists that reveal new perceptions on the case. A lot of different opinions and stands on a matter create a full picture and make the story more realistic. Throu conflict and exchange of opinions logic and reasoning wins. It is a walk trough to layers work induction and deduction in reasoning.

24 June 2023,Mind Blowing THRILLE i HAVE SEEN . i DONT KNOW how much time i wathed this stuff,"There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. Are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox.

21 August 2011,yawn,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",1
13 March 2018,I Forget to blink while watching this,"... Every moment is as intense as having a gun to your face. Will he won't he will he won't he? The psychological phenomena that is portrayed in 12 Angry Men is spot on. I remember first watching this film after I had studied for 4 years psychology and was finishing a paper on The emotion of Anger, and some things I remember every time watching it as my every prediction came true. For instance, Heat rises, they are getting hot, extra heat adds to stress that adds to agitation that in turn leads to a higher percentage of Anger. They just want to get out. Leadership. Look who sits where and what role they play, who is at the head of the table? Who is wearing what? Who speaks first and why? more importantly who is the last to speak? Was it wiser to hear every ones opinions first and make a comeback with opposing arguments? Look for the leadership ques in the characters If you are interested in such work, you should read psychological research on Leadership, Aggression and basics into forensics psychology and law.

27 October 2005,Brilliant film,"Low on special effects but big on acting. This film is just great. Te atmosphere is steamy, the dialogue is great. Sometimes the simplest premise is jut the best. Henry Fonda was brilliant in ""On Golden pond "", In Twelve Angry Men he touched the stars. This film though was not just a way to promote Fonda, the supporting cast are absolutely superb and must have been so easy for the director to work with. If anyone knows a film with a simpler series of sets building slowly to a crescendo due to the superb dialogue, please let me know. I end up sweating just watching the persuasive talents of the main protagonist of the brilliant movie. Please, watch this film and assess if the American way of Justice is the best

24 January 2008,A movie that I dislike -- 12 Angry Men,"The main reason that I dislike this movie because it is played in black and white. It made feel tired, so I cannot concentrate in the movie.

Another point is that it did not change much scene, they mainly acted in the jury room. They stayed in there for most of the time that made me feel uncomfortable and closely packed together.

After that, I think they had talked to much about the case and they waste so much in talking the same thing.

All in all, I don't like this movie because it is black and white and it seems to be that they were repeating the same point again and again. Therefore I don't like this movie at all.

25 December 2020,Surprisingly amazing,"Had to watch this for a high school subject, and expected a mediocre b&w film. Ended up watching one of my favourite films of all time (not that I'm a film connoisseur or anything but still). The characters are perfect, the acting is perfect, the camera angles are perfect etc.

26 March 2021,Watch it if have time to waste !,"As a team of film critics, we recently went to the cinema to see a broadcast of the movie ""12 angry men"" and God, what a great film for octogenarians! Maybe to give you our opinion about it, we must put this dud into context.

12 angry men or ""12 hommes en colère"" in French, is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the eponymous piece of theatre of 1954 written by Reginald Rose. As Lumet is a filmmaker known for his tragedies and critics of American justice system, we were, as fans waiting for a harrowing masterpiece! But we think that our small introduction made you understand that we were disappointed.

The movie unfolds in a jury room in which 12 jurors are deliberating the case of an impoverished 18-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his father to death. Therefore, the spectator follows this uneven trial for not less than ninety-six minutes, which is of course a bit exhausting. However, you may be pleased when seeing the cast with Henry Fonda, which would be normal. Yet, he probably is the reason of the movie's recognition, because there is nothing else that distinguishes it from other courtroom films such as Liar Liar from 1997. Maybe, we are scandalmongers because you probably know Martin Balsam? Or John Fiedler? No, you don't? To be honest we think that Fonda, Mr Davis in the movie, or the juror eight truly makes the film. If the gamechanger, the one who was about to save the young boy by rebelling against the tyranny of the majority, was anonymous for the spectators, would people give the movie that much attention? We do not think so. Nevertheless, the themes addressed in this film seemed intrusting: the justice and the question of morality and values are omnipresent, but they would be the few positive points. In fact, it contains an underlying message about prejudicial actions, the difficulties to be a juror and even racism during the fifties. It provides an interesting perspective on the importance of being a juror and the possible biases that jurors could, and still can encounter nowadays. It is both dramatic and tense, and it is insightful in its depiction of various aspects of humanity. But we were unable to identify with this film as it was impossible to identify with any of the jurors, it felt like they were not communicating any emotion.

Moreover, the script may seem ingenious but if you dig a bit it is not really the case and almost becomes boring at one point. It was so hard not to fall asleep while watching it. We were neither surprised nor excited to see the film and after we saw it. Don't you think the story is a bit far-fetched? Twelve brains take ninety minutes to agree on such an obvious case? Of course, he was not guilty. But after all, this movie kind of shows how screwed up the American justice system is. The poor boy is found guilty before all the evidence were even considered. Logic would dictate that he is not guilty until proven innocent, but apparently only one brain managed to take that detail into account, which made the scenario a bit inconceivable.

To be the most objective as possible, 12 angry men is one of the films that did not aged well. Overall, this is a good movie if you like vintage (because it is trending again), slow-paced, and closed-door films. You can also go see it if you like films that denounce timeless issues that still occur today. Also, if you like Henry Fonda, you want to watch it because he still plays greatly. It can be a great old school classic, but definitely a waste of time for people, like us from Generation Z. If you are into more dynamic courtroom movies, we would advice you to watch more recent ones, such as ""Just mercy"" from 2019 or ""the Trial of the Chicago 7"" that was released last year!",3
24 January 2008,The 12 Quarreling Men,"""Life Is In Their Hands -- Dealth Is On Their Minds!"" A tag-line of 12 Angry Men.

12 Angry Men had 3 nominations for Oscars and won 13 other awards, but it does not mean that every one will like this movie. While the movie started with the dark and white atmosphere it gave me a tiresome impression. 12 men were just sitting in a room quarreling and sometimes murmuring and muttering. Are movies only providing human acting and talking?

Teenagers like me like to have something much exciting, but not sitting dully in a room. Secondly, I wasn't engrossed in the Juror quarreling during the film. I don't think most of you are interested in others' affairs, especially others' conflicts. Also, as the tag-line shows, the life and death of the boy is in their hands, but how about the audience? It seemed that we have already been left out. In addition, Henry Fonda is a good actor, however, when the movie ends, I think everybody would have asked ""Is that all?"" I still had a hope to see anything unexpectedly broken out before the ending, but what a pity that it did not happen.

It may be a great masterpiece to most of people but I hardly have a slight interest on it. My comments might have changed if the 'debate' had an unpredictable result.",4
26 June 2023,Amazing Things,"Amazing things are masterpieces with god given details. This is also that kind of masterpiece in cinema industry.

""12 Angry Men"" is a timeless masterpiece that delves deep into the intricacies of the human psyche, examining the fragile nature of justice and the power of persuasion. Directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, this black-and-white gem continues to captivate audiences with its compelling narrative and exceptional performances.

The story unfolds entirely within the confines of a jury room, where twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young man accused of murder. As the jurors grapple with the overwhelming burden of their decision, tensions rise and conflicts emerge. What initially appears to be an open-and-shut case becomes a thought-provoking examination of prejudice, reasonable doubt, and the flaws inherent in the justice system.

The film's greatest strength lies in its characters, brought to life by a remarkable ensemble cast. Each juror possesses a distinct personality and perspective, leading to heated debates that highlight the diverse range of human experiences. The performances are superb across the board, with standout portrayals from Henry Fonda as Juror #8 and Lee J. Cobb as Juror #3, both delivering nuanced performances that showcase the emotional depth of their characters.",10
21 October 2010,Twelve Angry Men,"The film Twelve Angry Men did not interest me as much as I thought it would. I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white. With this movie being so old, the audio and sound system had very poor quality. I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling. This review shows what I enjoyed about the film, what I found interesting and lastly what I disliked about the film and written play 'Twelve Angry Men'.",3

26 March 2018,A cross-examination of 12 stubborn men,"This film is an intriguing portrayal of human nature. The plot follows the troubles of 12 jurors set to convict a young boy accused of murder, as their preconceptions are challenged by one contrary juror who critically analyses the evidence to offer alternative reasons behind each piece. Despite the fact that the film is essentially set in one room, it remains fascinating to observe who the innate stubbornness of the men is challenged as their thoughts and views are continuously questioned; thus, they end up questioning themselves. This is undoubtedly a classic due to its cross-examination of the men and their characters whilst they do the same to the evidence presented to them.

25 March 2018,Amazing movie!,"12 Angry Men is a film that illustrates the diversity present in the society that we live in, and how the discordant ideas of people can fuel but also complicate negotiations. Although somewhat unrealistic due to extremely polar depictions of human behaviour, the movie manages to capture the characteristics of people from different walks of life, manifested in each of the twelve jurors.

Some analysis with minor spoilers!! Juror #8, the ""hero"" of the movie, displays objectivity and empathy, and gradually earns respect as a leader. From the outset, although ridiculed and singled out by the other eleven, he was unmoving with his open-minded stance that the boy deserved a fair chance to be acquitted. As Fisher and Ury put it in the book ""Getting To Yes"", ""Never yield to pressure, only to principle"". He believed in using ""fair standards"", thus he attempted to rally the others to be empathetic. If they were in the boy's situation, wouldn't they want their jury to be impartial and take their jobs seriously, especially since a life is at stake? Using the ""principle of reciprocity"", he brought awareness to the consequences of the decision, subtly appealing to those more rational. Being grounded and respected helps a lot when negotiating, because humans naturally tend to trust and follow someone they respect. In negotiations, the only certainty is that we will encounter a vast array of backgrounds, personalities, and ideologies. Despite being the cardinal concern over the course of the film, the reality of guilt or innocence turns out unimportant. Exemplifying how a diverse group of people can reach a unanimous, amicable decision, 12 Angry Men serves as a reminder that a wide range of perspectives, as well as positive negotiation skills, are crucial in any negotiation.",9

8 November 2020,a surprisingly engaging movie,"Black and white movies tend to be easily regarded as boring, but this particular movie engages viewers. What seemed like a simple negotiation on the fate of a convicted boy turned into a prolonged heated discussion between 12 men. New issues and problems were uncovered as the story develops which causes perceptions and decisions to change. The different insights that these 12 men had to a common set of evidence that they had heard, coupled with their individual experiences that were used by some of these men to back up their reasoning, emphasised how everyone should be open-minded in a discussion, ready to listen to the views of others that we may not have noticed. This black and white movie is certainly something not to be missed.

16 April 2018,A lesson on negotiations,"12 Angry Men tells the tale of twelve jurors trying to come to a consensus on the verdict for a case of homicide, in which they will have to decide if a boy is innocent or guilty of killing his father on the basis of reasonable doubt. Through the heated exchanges among the jurors and the intriguing build up of the case as the story unfolds, we discover more about the distinctive personalities and backgrounds of each juror, who is peculiarly only referred to by number and not by name. Furthermore, we gain insights into the techniques they employ and difficulties they face in multi-party negotiation while trying to justify their stand and convince the others to switch over to their position. The movie incorporates light-hearted moments and comical dialogues to make it enjoyable for the viewers, and the technique of incrementally adding on to the narrative as the discussion progresses keeps the audience engaged. However, beneath the entertainment value of the film lie lessons in negotiation that we can learn from. It is an enriching movie that allows us to study the characteristics of negotiations and negotiators. It also shows us the relevance of the information in Roger Fisher's ""Getting to Yes"" book and the usefulness of principled negotiation, which we can apply in our daily lives.",8

17 April 2018,Good old classic film,"Despite being a black and white film, 12 Angry Men was thoroughly enjoyable and left me with a changed perspective of old classic films. This film provided me with an insight on inherent human flaws such as biasness and our tendency to rely on emotions when handling issues. The different scenarios portrayed by the different jurors provided an accurate depiction of instances when we rely on emotions rather than facts when handling negotiations.

20 April 2018,Excellent film on negotiations!,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",9
22 April 2018,Seat-grabber worth your time,"Going in thinking 12 Angry Men was a lame black and white film I had to watch for an assignment, I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. Even though the film was set in one location, there was never a dull point and the conversations and debates between the jurors were always so intense and exciting.

The film uses the decision-making process of 12 jurors to bring us on a roller-coaster of emotions. In the short one hour and 36 minutes, many uncomfortable issues were brought to light. This included discrimination, racism, and even more personal problems like self-purpose and worth. All these issues were presented to the audience in a very bite-sized way, with each juror embodying one, allowing us to see the parallels in our own lives.

What I found most interesting was how the importance of being a good negotiator shined through for me in the film. 12 Angry Men was able to portray the wide spectrum of negotiators, from skilled and objective negotiators, to hot-headed and ego-centric ones. Through them, we were able to see the repercussions of allowing our emotions and personal pre-conceived notions overwhelm our decisions. I learnt to not be so quick to judge and to always consider the possibility of alternatives before being certain about something. There will always be things that we will not see or know.

But yes, all in all, I truly enjoyed the movie as it left me thinking about the uncomfortable issues that we may not always want to deal with. I totally recommend watching this, even if you are someone who is not into older films. It's definitely worth your time!",10

24 April 2018,Disagreement to Successful Negotiation,"In this movie 12 Angry Men, 12 jurors convene in a jury room to decide the verdict of an 18-year-old boy from the slums who had been convicted of murdering his father. Since the premise of the movie revolves around the negotiation of whether the boy is guilty or not guilty, three key insights are highlighted with regards to successful, principled negotiation: firstly, reconciling interests rather than positions; secondly, the strategy of negotiation jujitsu to counter positional bargaining; and lastly, the importance of separating people from positions and remembering that negotiation is between human beings.

This is an insightful movie which allows us as humans to think and ponder about our words and actions in a disagreement, using them to intentionally turn it into a successful negotiation instead.

19 September 2015,Good Movie,"Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.

Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.

Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.

Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).

Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.

Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.

Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.

Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.

Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.

Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.

Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.

Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.

The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",10
30 March 2023,Oldie but a Goldie,"Proves that old movies hold up and that classics are not to be underestimated.

""12 Angry Men"" is a masterpiece that has withstood the test of time. Even though it was released more than 60 years ago, the themes explored in the movie are still relevant and poignant today. The film's narrative, which takes place in one room, may seem simple at first, but the superb acting and clever dialogue keep the audience engaged throughout. The film's exploration of justice, prejudice, and the complexities of human nature still resonates with modern audiences. ""12 Angry Men"" is a classic example of how old movies can still hold up today and remain relevant to modern audiences. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking and wants to see how great storytelling can stand the test of time.

19 January 2016,Great Movie,"It is superior that there are twelve men trying to figure out if this child is innocent. This movie really keeps you on your toes, because as the title states, ""Twelve Angry Men,"". As I first watched it in a speech class, I did not understand until I took upon myself to watch it. There are a few things that could have been done differently; the room could have been a little bigger to make it seem more real. Of course this movie is old, so you can tell some of the fake things from the real stuff. In the middle of the movie; I got very upset because of the multiple decisions and debates going on which set up the climax. Overall, if someone is looking for a great movie to watch not only to catch up with history, but to just have a lazy day, it is a black and white movie. Black and white movies don't get old.

29 June 2023,Memorable and not at all what I had expected,"Going into this I hadn't been looking forward to watching this movie but it had been so highly recommended by the community and friends.

The plot of the movie is about as simple as it gets. 12 men are selected sit on a jury, but we only get to see the very end of the trial. Instead the movie is set in the room where the jury is discussing the case. But don't let that fool you, if anything it just enhances the experience. What makes this film so memorable is the characters. They all come from different walks of life which makes their opinions very different.

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie not just for its ""classic"" style and enormous success but for the suspenseful and unexpected story.

9 September 2022,Genius work... but a little bit to theatrical.,"I find the original play text absolutely astonishing, but some of the gestures and poses of actors are more suitable for stage, rather than a movie set... But it's a small flaw for such an epic drama that will surely stay in the history of cinema forever as one of the best watching experiences ever.

The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.

This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?",8
21 August 2023,Best Movie Ever!,"The best I have ever seen. It gives you a good perspective of a very important lesson in life. Never judge something too soon. And things are not what they seem at first. You have to go the extra mile while searching for the truth. You have to look and dig deeper to see things clearly. And in order to be able to do that, you have to ask the right questions. This movies was a paradigm shift for me. It made me think twice before claiming any truth on my part especially that people are complicated and their actions are way more compound and confusing to be perceived easily. You know, you never know.

6 April 2023,s it fair and just to accept an innocent outcome.,"The plot unfolds well, but the parts that Davis advocates are only ambiguous speculations. In fact, after verifying these things one by one, the child may or may not be the culprit. It's just that the initial work of the prosecution was not done well, and the cross examination of the defense was not done well. The case should be re investigated, rather than simply judged innocent. I am honored to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short review from eleven years ago as a vulgar representative of the masses. If I want to add now, I would say that the dereliction of duty by the power organs is one thing, and there is no fault with reasonable questioning, but there is a fault with the verdict of not guilty in the end. Because whether the masses blindly follow the speculation of institutions or male leaders, they are only being crushed. Literary and artistic youth criticize me for pursuing the truth and vulgarity, so as long as it contradicts the institutional perspective, is it fair and just to accept an innocent outcome.

18 June 2023,Any jury on this movie will reach the same verdict - A CLASSIC,"12 Angry Men is a classic movie that shows how a jury of twelve men decides the verdict of a murder trial. The movie is set entirely in one room, where the jurors debate the evidence and the testimony of the witnesses. The movie is not only a thrilling and realistic portrayal of the judicial system, but also a powerful and insightful examination of the human psyche, the social issues, and the ethical dilemmas that arise in such a situation. The movie features an outstanding cast of actors, who bring to life the complex and diverse characters of the jurors, each with their own background, personality, and opinion. 12 Angry Men is a brilliant and timeless movie that will make you think, question, and empathize.

10 August 2023,An amazing experience,"At first I questioned why a black and white film from 1957 has survived countless generations of technological iterations to take its place in the ever-innovating history of cinema. However, as I watched the film I realised that it should be in everyone's top ten films.

There are few films that are so brilliant and overwhelmingly uplifting. In the film 12 actors act as a jury to decide a murder case, and their decision will be about the life of a young boy. The 12 include people from all walks of life, all personalities and all ages. At first everyone thinks the verdict is a foregone conclusion given the overwhelming evidence...until one juror raises his doubts and the crowd begins to examine their evidence one by one. As the trial progresses, one piece of seemingly unassailable evidence is gradually overturned, and an unbelievable situation surfaced,the boy is acquitted.

Nowadays, when we watch a film, we care more about the beautiful images and the huge worldview. However, this film has no bright colours, no lengthy plot, just a vivid and simple story in a small room about human nature - something that has always been the same.

We often encounter similar situations in our lives. Do we try to find out the truth and avoid misattributions?",10
16 August 2023,Simple but powerful,"Watching this movie I realised that a good movie and story doesn't come only from its size and complexity, but also from the impact and strength of the ideas that it shares and how much it is able to captivate you. Well this one really does captivate you, and it will surely make you think about it a long time after you are done watching it.

The entire action of this movie is happening inside only one room and within a few hours, the conflict is also not complicated but rather a small and intriguing one. The thing that makes it special as well is that within the length of the movie you and the characters are presented how important a wide range of opinions and visions is in taking a serious decision. And it also teaches the viewers the significance of communication between parties, having a good attention to detail and keeping an unbiased opinion as much as possible.

I consider the movie ""12 Angry Men"" to be a must see for any film enthusiast.",9
11 August 2023,best movie iN the World,"12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, stands as a timeless classic that delves into the intricate workings of human psychology, prejudice, and the pursuit of justice within the confines of a single jury room. The film's gripping narrative, stellar cast, and masterful direction have solidified its place as a cinematic gem that continues to resonate with audiences across generations.

Set almost entirely in a claustrophobic jury room, the film takes place after a murder trial has concluded, leaving the jury with the weighty responsibility of determining the fate of a young man accused of murder. The initial vote is overwhelmingly guilty, with only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) standing firm in his belief that the accused deserves a fair and thorough deliberation.

The brilliance of ""12 Angry Men"" lies in its exploration of the complexities of human nature and the prejudices that often influence our decisions. As the deliberations unfold, we witness the jurors' gradual transformation from a unanimous guilty verdict to a more nuanced understanding of the case. Each juror's personality, background, and biases come to the forefront, creating a tension-filled atmosphere that reflects the broader societal issues of the time.

Henry Fonda's performance as Juror #8 is a standout, capturing the essence of rationality and empathy. His calm and composed demeanor contrasts sharply with the increasingly heated exchanges among the jurors. The supporting cast, comprising legendary actors like Lee J. Cobb, Jack Klugman, and Ed Begley, delivers exceptional portrayals of characters with distinct personalities and perspectives.

Sidney Lumet's direction is nothing short of brilliant. By utilizing the confined space of the jury room, Lumet skillfully ramps up the intensity, making the audience feel as though they too are participants in the deliberation process. The use of camera angles, lighting, and close-ups effectively accentuates the emotional turmoil within the room, adding depth to the characters' internal struggles.

The screenplay, penned by Reginald Rose, captures the essence of the original teleplay on which the film is based. The dialogue is sharp, incisive, and meticulously crafted to unravel the layers of the case and the jurors' biases. The pacing is deliberate, allowing each character's story to unfold organically, and building suspense as the group slowly inches toward a consensus.",

23 September 2016,Great,"Tempers and personalities start to clash over what the verdict should be and why....and then they all go their separate ways at the end. One of my all time favorite movies. www.****.pk , Everyone should watch this movie. In addition to the cast of talented actors and excellent story line, anyone who ever serves on a jury would benefit from having watched this. It is amazing that a movie this good could be set exclusively in one room. Everyone needs to watch this movie is just for the sake of digesting the news we see every day. This week two black men died at the hands of police. Immediately Obama called it racial... but when you look deeper, and as for facts come out, it really doesn't seem like that...

that said, this movie is amazing and everyone should watch it once in their life.

2 November 2010,12 angry men,"I like this book because the story is interesting me, also I like some parts of film, such as: the actor, some details and so on. But I was more likely with the written play, because it was fun that you could imagine what the story was acted, and it was better then the film, because you could use your brain to work on and to know what story was talking about and how they acted. Also, I like juror No.8 in the written play, because he was smart and brave. For example, juror No.8 was the only one to find out the problem of witness's testimony and acted hoe witness could did it. Another example, juror No.8 still insisted his vote, and he changed juror's vote and he saved the accuser's life at the end. I did not like the film because it's black and white, do not have good action, and have a lot of arguing. Also, sometimes the film is not connecting to the book and the film will add something that not belongs to the book. For example, the book did not talk about juror No.3 was crying and changing his vote at the end. And juror No.9 walked to juror No.8 and introduced him then the end. For other reason that I did not like the film because of juror No.3 because his act was so exaggerate and he cannot without his personal emotion. Such as: in Act 2, juror No.8 said that you want to see this boy die because you personally want it, then juror No.3 started to shouting and slapped on the desk said, "" I'll kill you, I'll kill you.""",
23 April 2018,Prejudice explored,"The film 12 Angry Men by Sidney Lumet gives us a picture of a very probably real life situation of negotiations taking place. It follows 12 white male jurors trying to reach a verdict in the murder trial of a Puerto Rican teenager who is accused of knifing his father. The task the jurors have is grave as their decision must be unanimous in whether this boy is to be given the death penalty. Despite the gravity of the situation, not everyone perceives it this way.

I enjoyed how the complexity of human prejudice is explored in the film. While its central story is based on the fact that 12 white jurors are reaching a verdict on a migrant Puerto Rican teenager's murder trial, the film also turns the prejudice on the viewer - in our assumption that all 12 men are the same.

It is highly enjoyable and spurs good thought.

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it.

31 December 2014,Excellent movie,"The film is considered a classic because of the heroism and humanitarianism of Juror #8, because of the film's great direction of keeping such a small space visually fresh and because well it's a darn good story. I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.

Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the ""guilty"" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.

While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",5
25 September 2023,A screenplay masterpiece,"Such a wonderful movie where the script brights the best. When a story has a limited location it is the script's job to hold the audience's attention through all the film. This movie does an excelent job at taking us in this trip of emotions, where we'll meet 12 men, all different but yet similar in many things: human morality. A simple task like getting an unanimous vote becomes a burdensome as we know more and more about the facts in the case.

In this story we get to empathize a lot with the characters, all 12 of them, the script does an exceptional job at creating individual arcs for each character, their personality and touch that they bring to the table.

It's an amazing film that puts into perspective what could happen when men have the power over other people, what could happen when men subliminally play the role of God.

14 January 2021,Perfection,"Based on a play - this is a perfect courtroom (jury) vignette. I have watched it over 50 times overe the years, and always find somethig new - in the words, the camera, the characters, the mood... (I have read the one, two, and three star reviews - who complain it is in black & white, or set in just one room, or only had men!! They do not see the irony, that THEY are the jurors with irrational presuppositions that we are all wary of. THEY are the jurors in that room that decide the fate of a person. Read their reviews - and be very afraid. (Note: you can hate the film, but your reasons must be rational)). This is as perfect a movie, with deeper themes, as you can get. It is about democracy and prejudice and peer pressure and scepticism and free thinking and civic responsibility and privelege and hope. There are so many subtle cinematographic techniques that enhance the themes. This is a movie to be engaged with. Enjoy.

12 November 2019,Fantastic,"This is a film with one hell of a slow burn. Small cast, small budget, only really taking place in two rooms. With a fantastic commentary on group think and conformity, this film is worth a watch for anyone interested in psychology and groupthink.

6 February 2019,So. Well. Done.,"How one director can keep you at the edge of your seat for 1.5 hours with an entire movie set in one room is a true skill. A must see.
